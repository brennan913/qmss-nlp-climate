Our planet may be in better shape than you think.

Human beings have a cognitive bias toward bad news (keeping us alert and alive), and we journalists reflect that: We report on planes that crash, not planes that land. We highlight disasters, setbacks, threats and deaths, so 2022 has kept us busy.

But a constant gush of despairing news can be paralyzing. So here’s my effort to remedy our cognitive biases. Until the pandemic, I wrote an annual column arguing that the previous year was the best in human history. I can’t do that this year. But I can suggest that broadly speaking, much is going right and this may still be the best time ever to be alive.

Where 2022 excelled particularly was in technological strides.

Solar power capacity around the world is on track to roughly triple over the next five years and overtake coal as the leading source of power globally. Technical improvements are constant — such as M.I.T. researchers’ developing a way to produce thin and flexible solar panels that can turn almost any outdoor surface into a power source.

There are parallel breakthroughs in batteries. Batteries, boring? No! They’re one of the most exciting frontiers of technology, making remarkable advances crucial to storing green power. Likewise, nuclear fusion as an energy source marked a milestone in 2022. Green hydrogen is also gaining ground and could be useful for shipping and energy storage."

A Dutch court sentenced three men to life in prison yesterday in the 2014 case of a passenger jet that was shot down over a separatist region of eastern Ukraine. The men, who have ties to the Russian security services, were tried in absentia. A fourth man was acquitted.

The verdict offered a bare measure of justice for the 298 people killed in the downing of the jet, a Malaysia Airlines flight traveling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, known as MH17. (Here’s a timeline of the tragedy.)

The trial opened more than two years ago in an attempt to assign responsibility for what had long seemed a crime without punishment. On July 17, 2014, an antiaircraft missile provided to separatist forces by the Russian military shot down MH17.

The war in Ukraine has given the case a new significance. Support for separatists in eastern Ukraine was a key part of Vladimir Putin’s pretext for Russia’s full-scale invasion. The verdict may also set an example for possible prosecutions of Russian crimes during the war."

Trump, seeing an opening with organized labor, appealed on Thursday for an endorsement from the United Auto Workers for his White House bid and said only his return to the presidency could save the automotive industry from President Biden’s “ridiculous Green New Deal crusade.”

Mr. Trump’s apocalyptic vision of the state of the American auto industry does not comport with the reality of an auto sector that has steadily gained jobs over the past three years. But there has been friction between the White House and the new leadership of the old-line industrial auto union.

The United Auto Workers, which has a record of backing Democratic candidates for president, including Mr. Biden, has been angered with the Biden administration for pumping tax money into nonunion electric vehicle suppliers, and has withheld its endorsement, even as most labor unions have rushed to back Mr. Biden’s re-election. The U.A.W.’s new president, Shawn Fain, met with Mr. Biden in the White House on Wednesday as contract talks with the Big Three automakers heat up over electric vehicle parts suppliers.

In a video on Thursday, Mr. Trump predicted the demise of American auto manufacturing and the “slaughter” of 117,000 auto jobs. “I hope United Auto Workers is listening to this because I think you’d better endorse Trump,” he said. He explicitly warned that Mr. Biden’s policies would cost jobs in the key swing state of Michigan, as well as the more reliably Republican states of Ohio and Indiana."

The rest would be gasoline-powered and get an estimated 8.6 miles per gallon when the air conditioning was turned on.

That triggered a fierce backlash from Biden administration officials and Democrats in Congress, who warned that all those new gasoline-powered trucks would stay on the road for decades, spewing heat-trapping pollution into the air all the while. The White House and the Environmental Protection Agency argued that the plan was based on a flawed environmental analysis. Attorneys general from 16 states and the District of Columbia, along with five environmental groups and the United Auto Workers, sued the agency over the decision.

In July, the Postal Service shifted course and promised that 40 percent of new trucks would be electric. But, Mr. DeJoy said, the agency needed more funding from Congress if it wanted to go further. (Electric vehicles can cost more upfront than gasoline-powered models, though they can often make up the savings on fuel and maintenance costs in subsequent years.)

The breakthrough came in August, when Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, a sweeping tax and climate change law that included $3 billion for the Postal Service to electrify its fleet.

“The $3 billion provided by Congress has significantly reduced the risk associated with accelerating the implementation of a nationwide infrastructure necessary to electrify our delivery fleet,” Mr. DeJoy said in a statement Tuesday. “We have a statutory requirement to deliver mail and packages to 163 million addresses six days per week and to cover our costs in doing so — that is our mission. As I have said in the past, if we can achieve those objectives in a more environmentally responsible way, we will do so.”"

Late Monday, the Coast Guard spotted another whale floating south of the Ambrose shipping channel, between New York and New Jersey; two teams from New York located the animal and determined that it was a humpback, but it was not clear where it might wash ashore.

Of course, the emissions from the energy we use to maintain a comfortable home contribute to the extreme weather we’re protecting ourselves against. How does it all break down? A new report from WalletHub compares the monthly costs of electricity, natural gas, motor fuel and heating oil in all 50 states and Washington, D.C.

Energy needs vary by region, but the study suggests that heating a cold home is much more expensive than cooling a warm one. The highest costs for heating oil were found in Wyoming, helping to raise its total energy costs above all the other states. Two more frigid states — North Dakota and Alaska — followed.

Washington D.C., neither very hot nor very cold, had the lowest energy costs, helped not just by its milder climate and moderate costs across all forms of energy, but by lower gasoline consumption. Two warm states, New Mexico and Texas, followed, with their total energy costs kept down by low requirements for heating fuel."

The strategy was announced as part of the new government’s coalition agreement when Chancellor Olaf Scholz took office in December 2021. But the war in Ukraine has since heightened Germany’s sense that it had become vulnerable to new military, economic and geopolitical threats, including climate change.

“Germany’s security environment is undergoing profound change and we are living through a watershed era, a Zeitenwende,” or turning point, the paper says. With Russia’s threat to European security, and China seen as a complicated competitor, systemic rival but still “a necessary partner,” the paper says, “we are redoubling our efforts with a view to keeping our country secure and free.”

Mr. Scholz praised the paper’s effort to combine foreign, domestic and economic priorities, calling it “a big, big change in the way we deal with security issues.” But while the publication of the document was largely welcomed, some analysts said it lacked detail, especially on how its ambitions would be funded."

Symphony orchestras were long seen as the dominion of men. And turnover is generally extremely slow at leading ensembles like the Philharmonic, whose players are tenured and can remain in their posts for many years. Meaningful demographic change can take decades.

“It’s more of a family now,” said Sherry Sylar, associate principal oboe, who joined the orchestra in 1984. “There are moms and pops both.”

For much of its history, the Philharmonic, the oldest symphony orchestra in the United States, was closed off to women. At the time of its founding in 1842, women were not only discouraged from pursuing careers in music — it was rare for them to attend evening concerts unless they were with men. (In “Philharmonic: A History of New York’s Orchestra,” Howard Shanet wrote that during the 19th century, the ensemble’s public rehearsals on Friday afternoons were popular with “unaccompanied ladies who could venture forth by day with more propriety than they could by night.”)

It was not until 1922 that the Philharmonic hired its first female member, Stephanie Goldner, a 26-year-old harpist from Vienna. She departed in 1932, and the orchestra became an all-male bastion again for decades.

Then, in 1966, Orin O’Brien, a double bassist, was hired as the Philharmonic’s first female section player. Often described as the first woman to become a permanent member of the orchestra, she was at the vanguard of a pioneering group of female artists who opened doors for other women to join. The orchestra’s move toward blind auditions in the 1970s was seen as making the process fairer. By 1992, there were 29 women in the orchestra.

Even as representation increased, however, female musicians often faced discrimination. Sexism was widespread in the industry (the maestro Zubin Mehta, who opined in 1970 that he still did not think women should be in orchestras because they “become men,” was named the orchestra’s music director six years later). Fewer women got the best-paid principal positions, and some who did found that they earned far less than their male counterparts. In 2019, the Boston Symphony settled a lawsuit in which the principal flutist of the orchestra said she was being paid less than a male colleague, the principal oboist."

Rescue workers dug through rubble yesterday to find survivors of the most powerful and deadly earthquake to hit Turkey and Syria in decades, toiling in a vast and desperate search complicated by geography and geopolitics, freezing weather and the sheer scope of the disaster. At least 7,700 people were reported dead, and the toll is expect to climb, officials said.

There is some slim reason for hope: More than 8,000 people have been rescued in Turkey alone. In Gaziantep, a Turkish city near the epicenter of the quake, four members of one family were painstakingly rescued. And in northwest Syria, residents found an infant crying in the rubble of a collapsed building. But the search for survivors is a fight against time, as temperatures sank below freezing and snow piled up on the debris.

In Turkey, the rescue efforts spanned 10 provinces and hundreds of miles, from sprawling, ancient Gaziantep to rural towns and villages where roads buckled so badly they could not be used. The Turkish Navy sent ships with heavy machinery, blankets, generators and food, and the national emergency management agency dispatched more than 16,000 workers.

In remarks at the end of a two-day summit with the leaders of Mexico and Canada, Mr. Biden dismissed criticism from Republicans, Democrats and humanitarian groups, calling them the “extremes” and saying he was pursuing a middle ground in his approach to immigration.

“I want to thank the president of Mexico for agreeing to take up to 3,000 people back,” Mr. Biden said, apparently referring to the announcement last week that Mexico would accept 30,000 migrants each month from Venezuela, Haiti, Nicaragua and Cuba who attempt to cross into the United States illegally.

That increased enforcement at the border has been condemned by Democrats and human rights groups as an inhumane denial of asylum rights. But Mr. Biden said on Tuesday that the creation of new legal immigration programs for people from those countries counterbalanced that effort."

In “What’s on the Minds of 12 Young Voters,” Maggie Astor writes about a dozen Americans under 30, all living in swing states, who have a range of political priorities:

Whether they are marching against gun violence, advocating stronger action against climate change or pushing for or against abortion rights, young Americans of all political stripes have been engaged in some of the prominent social movements of the 21st century. Electorally, however, they have often struggled to make their voices heard, despite turning out in increasing numbers in 2018 and 2020. A New York Times/Siena College poll found that likely voters younger than 30 planned to support a Democrat for Congress by a 12-point margin in next month’s elections, compared with a narrow advantage for Republicans among likely voters at large. But, compared with older generations, they were less likely to say they would vote at all. Twelve voters in their 20s, living in states with competitive Senate or governor’s races, spoke with photographers for The New York Times about the issues they considered most important. Though President Biden’s student debt forgiveness plan had been in the news, none said it was a top issue. Instead, they discussed their views on abortion, climate, the economy and immigration — or a search for, as one 24-year-old Wisconsin woman put it, “what’s best for the collective versus the singular.”

Jayda Priester, 25, who lives in Atlanta said:

“The most important issue for me is defunding the police. I am hugely for defunding the police and putting other resources available for crisis management, de-escalation.”

Chris Ahmann, 18, of Madison, Wis., a first-year mechanical engineering student at the University of Wisconsin and a first-generation Filipino American, said:

“Immigration is really close to me. I’m one of the only people in my family who is in the U.S. right now. I was born here, but they want to come here to the U.S. I’d like to see it easier for people.”

Emily McDermott, 27, of Lansdowne, Pa., said one of the issues she is voting on is abortion:

“Life begins in the womb, and I think that that is an inalienable right. And I don’t think it’s up to us to decide who lives and dies.”

“This proposal would lower the risk that bears will associate food at bait stations with humans and become conditioned to eating human-produced foods, thereby creating a public safety concern,” the National Park Service said in a statement.

Activists called it a victory for animal rights.

“We have long argued that our government must protect our nation’s treasured wildlife and not be working hand-in-hand with trophy hunters to sanction some of the most ruthless killing methods targeted at defenseless animals,” Kitty Block, president of the Humane Society of the United States, said in a statement.

Sara Amundson, president of the Humane Society Legislative Fund, issued a statement calling the new rule “a victory for Alaska’s iconic wildlife species.”

“Baiting bears just to blast them over a pile of doughnuts is just wrong,” she said.

The Trump administration prioritized expanding hunting rights on federal lands. Mr. Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., an avid hunter, championed trophy hunting. In 2020 the Safari Club International, which promotes big-game hunting, auctioned a weeklong “dream hunt” through Alaska with the president’s son as part of its annual convention."

A Dutch court yesterday sentenced three men with ties to the Russian security services to life in prison over the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, commonly known as MH17, which killed all 298 people aboard. The plane was shot down over eastern Ukraine in July 2014 during a Moscow-backed separatist uprising that foreshadowed Russia’s full-scale invasion this year.

The victims’ families drew some solace from the verdict, which placed responsibility on Moscow, but the men who were found guilty may never be arrested. And the fact that the convictions came after eight years of investigation, amid Russian stonewalling, highlights the challenges for prosecutors, as they try to hold more recent Russian war criminals accountable.

The crash was by far the biggest loss of civilian life in the conflict up to that time, eliciting global outrage.

Quotable: “I’ve always said that our family members were the first non-Ukrainian people that were the victims of a war that started eight years ago,” said Piet Ploeg, the chairman of a group representing family members of the crash victims."

Complex and largely unrecognized causal links among the world’s economic, social and ecological systems may be causing many risks to go critical at nearly the same time. If so, the apparent simultaneity isn’t just a temporary coincidence; it’s likely to persist and could ultimately overwhelm the capacity of society to adapt, and push some places into outright collapse, as we may be witnessing right now in Haiti.

But we don’t really know because, generally, experts at evaluating risk have deeply specialized and siloed knowledge — in economics, for example, or epidemiology. This knowledge rarely translates into detailed understandings of other systemic risks at play and how they might affect one another in turn. So, for example, while specialists in climate change’s economic impacts know something about how climate heating aggravates economic inequality within and between societies, they know very little about how it impacts ideological extremism. And they give virtually no attention to the possibility that causation might operate in the reverse direction, too — that inequality and extremism might worsen climate heating.

Yet it’s likely all these processes are now operating. Climate heating is harming people’s health and causing weather disasters, affecting infrastructure and food production all over the planet. In poorer countries, these changes are constraining economic growth and widening existing economic inequalities. Lower growth and bigger inequalities, wherever they happen, intensify ideological extremism. And that extremism is likely making it harder to build national and international consensus around cutting greenhouse gas emissions, allowing the heating problem to steadily worsen.

These sorts of vicious cycles are what complexity scientists call self-reinforcing “positive feedbacks.” We tend to see bits and pieces of a causal loop, but not the whole thing. For that reason, we urgently need to identify and monitor these feedbacks and ferret out those still unrecognized to establish whether they are synchronizing the world’s systemic risks. Businesses do similar kinds of risk analysis by diagraming causal loops in the dynamic systems affecting them. In this case, the system is the planet itself. It goes back to the ecologist Barry Commoner’s first rule of ecology — everything is connected to everything else — but with a crucial amendment: some kinds of connections matter a lot more than others.

We propose a worldwide scientific collaboration to identify the causal mechanisms operating among these risks. This collaboration would consist of a global consortium of nationally funded institutes. It would be dedicated, first, to studying mechanisms that are amplifying, accelerating and synchronizing global systemic risks and, second, to determining practical ways humanity might intervene. It would also look for ways these feedbacks might be harnessed to tip key economic, social, and ecological systems toward better outcomes."

“I think there was behavior that was likely to shatter women’s mental health,” said Ms. Rousseau, 50, a self-described “ecofeminist,” a philosophy that combines ecological concerns with feminist ones.

Her words had a swift impact: Radio and television shows lit up in debate, and Julien Bayou stepped down as the Green Party’s leader a week later, while denying he had emotionally abused a former partner.

“Before, we spoke only about rape, and after we talked about sexual aggression and harassment. Now, I think we need to talk about psychological violence because many women are victims of psychological violence. It’s a form of domination,” Ms. Rousseau said a few weeks later, in her small parliamentary office equipped with a bed, for long nights when debates rage on in the National Assembly, the lower and more powerful house of Parliament, to which she was elected this year."

Some are flexible. For example, allowing buildings to trade carbon reductions with one another would be a good way to cut costs while cutting carbon. Buildings that reduce their emissions below their caps could even make money by selling credits for those cuts to other buildings whose emissions reductions are more expensive. A study released by New York University in 2021 found carbon trading would lead to deeper cuts in greenhouse gas emissions and lower the cost of complying with the law.

Such a carbon trading program, which would most likely require approval by the mayor and City Council, must not be confused with what the city is proposing: using renewable energy credits to comply with the law. Buildings would obtain these credits by buying their electricity from sources that generate renewable energy, like solar or wind or hydropower. The credits would allow the buildings to deduct emissions from their overall emissions. But if buildings are allowed to buy too many credits, often at prices we calculate at well under $10 per ton, it would render the law toothless. The advisory board is recommending a cap of 30 percent of a building’s excess emissions. Instead the city should look to more creative solutions to provide more carrots for complying with the law.

The Inflation Reduction Act can help, a lot. It behooves New York City and the state to get their administrative acts together quickly to be ready to help homeowners take advantage of the many federal refunds for everything from heat pumps to induction stoves and for the insulation and electric wiring to make both work. Federal subsidies are important, but they, too, have real limits. In general, they are more designed to help those in single-family homes in the suburbs than urban apartment dwellers. Renters, for example, are almost entirely left out of the equation. They have little say other than to plead with their landlords to remove the gas stoves, which may be responsible for one-eighth of childhood asthma cases.

Fortunately for New York, there is another major carrot it could deploy. The city has a famously convoluted property tax system in sore need of reform. It wouldn’t be the first time a seemingly intractable problem gets solved by linking it to another problem in need of a solution. The city should reduce the tax burden of any large building that takes on an emissions reduction project.

Paul’s building in the Financial District has a monthly maintenance bill that is more than 50 percent taxes. While the building got support from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority for a boiler upgrade, the residents took the hit on the redo of the ancient central air-conditioning. It’s hard to imagine the co-op board approving another massive maintenance hike to meet emissions limits down the road without some corresponding incentives, like a cut in property taxes."

Soaring heat deaths represent a societal failure. They demonstrate not only the harm of environmental destruction but also how the poor fall through the cracks, how we as a society do not adequately care for one another, how we leave the vulnerable to die.

This is usually a sin of omission. We do not want the economically disadvantaged to not have access to working air-conditioners. We do not want the poor to be endangered. But we often do not see or know our most vulnerable neighbors.

Demographic sorting and the emergence of what the political scientist Charles Murray called “super ZIPS,” neighborhoods where the nation’s wealthiest families cluster, means that those with plenty of resources seemingly live on a different planet than those with few or none, even as we share the same city or state. The lives of the wealthy, the middle class and those in poverty are increasingly separated and utterly different. So Alfredo Garza Jr. died in Laredo last month, sweltering in a home with two broken air-conditioners, while my house, with a functioning air-conditioner, sat empty for a week as I traveled for work.

Then there are times when these deaths are caused by a sin of commission — an intentional act of greed and callousness. Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, for instance, signed a bill into law, amid triple-digit temperatures, that eliminated local regulations in Austin and Dallas mandating 10-minute water breaks every four hours for construction workers. It also prevented other cities from requiring even these modest safety measures. Applauded by supporters as pro-business, this bill expresses a shocking and inhumane disregard for human lives. Texas lawmakers appear to be punishing people for having the audacity to be working-class while also having basic bodily needs.

We all get hot. We all need water. We all need breaks. Lawmakers can ignore this reality because they work (on legislation like this bill) in air-conditioned offices. They drive home on roads made by the workers whose lives they are endangering. They pull inside their garages, close the door to the blistering heat and enter their comfortable homes, where their family members do not have to worry about dying of heat."

They have repeatedly said that New York had never faced anything like the smoke conditions, and that they did their best to respond to a threat they could never have anticipated.

Yet at a City Council hearing on Wednesday, the message from Council members and the city’s public advocate was clear: A city that has long been warning of the dangers of climate change did not move quickly enough to warn New Yorkers of the smoke or provide resources to mitigate its effects.

On Tuesday, an explosion in Poland near the border with Ukraine killed two people. Initial reports suggested that a Russian missile caused the explosion. But a fuller picture has since emerged.

Andrzej Duda, Poland’s president, said that early indications suggested that Ukrainian efforts to counter a barrage of Russian missiles caused the blast — not a direct attack on his country. He called it an “unfortunate accident” and said that there was “no evidence at the moment that it was a rocket launched by Russian forces.”

Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary general, also said that a Ukrainian air defense missile most likely caused the explosion in the tiny village of Przewodow, and that a fuller investigation was still underway. But Stoltenberg and the White House both said that even if the missile was Ukrainian, Russia was ultimately responsible.

“Let me be clear: This is not Ukraine’s fault,” Stoltenberg said. “Russia bears ultimate responsibility as it continues its illegal war against Ukraine.”"

Americans will finish voting in midterm elections today, which could change the balance of power in state and federal legislative bodies, influence foreign policy and foreshadow the 2024 presidential race.

Many races are teetering on a knife’s edge, but Democrats are bracing for losses even in traditionally blue areas. Republican control of the House, Senate or both could embolden the far-right and lawmakers in Washington who traffic in conspiracy theories and falsehoods. Here are four potential election outcomes.

Democrats have depicted Republicans as extreme, while Republicans have portrayed Democrats as out of touch on inflation and immigration. Crime is a key issue: Many Americans think there’s a surge in violence, which could benefit Republicans, even though experts disagree on the data.

It could also further politicize the U.S. approach to Iran and the war in Ukraine and allow Republicans to slow the torrent of aid to Kyiv. That could benefit Moscow: Russian trolls have stepped up efforts to spread misinformation before the midterms, which researchers say is an attempt to influence the outcome."

The four years he spent in England changed his life.

ROBIN POGREBIN Naomi, while you were studying at the largely traditional Courtauld Institute of Art in London, how much did you struggle against the white Eurocentric canon?

BECKWITH There were mentors and friends who asked why I wanted to go there, saying it was a place full of people in cashmere sweater sets and pearls. But the moment I arrived, it was an absolutely different story. The professors were all keen on keeping abreast of intellectual developments happening in the world in and out of art history.

TEMKIN That very much describes the goal of our collection galleries as we reconfigure them. That visitors to the galleries don’t feel a lecture — they feel a discussion. And they feel the electricity that comes from different curators working together and putting works of art together that haven’t been together, generating attractions and even discord.

BECKWITH Was this the result of a lengthy collecting practice and buildup?

TEMKIN It took a decade. So definitely no instant transformation of this kind is possible, because it can’t be something where you just wave a magic wand. People have to believe in it deeply and believe in each other. So soon after I became head of paintings and sculpture, we began meeting as a group of chief curators.

POGREBIN Which was a first, right? That had never been done before?

TEMKIN It was a first. What I had in mind was the integrating of the mediums in the galleries, because at that time painting and sculpture had the vast majority of the space in terms of square footage or works on view. To me, that was not artistically or intellectually serving the museum’s collection or our public or artists. It wasn’t true to artistic production. It’s not like an artist makes paintings, but never drawings or photographs or videos. The most important thing for a museum to be current and to be true to the art we’re showing is to be true to the artist’s practices."

Governments would also have to commit to not overproduce steel and aluminum, which has pushed down global metal prices, and to limit activity by state-owned enterprises, which are often used to funnel subsidies to foreign metal makers. While the concept paper does not mention China, these requirements appear likely to bar it from becoming a member.

The United States and European Union have been in talks about a climate-related trade deal for the steel and aluminum industries since last year. No U.S. trade agreement has ever included specific targets on carbon emissions, and negotiators have had much ground to cover to try to reconcile the varying U.S. and E.U. economic approaches to mitigating climate change.

It is unclear what type of reception the proposal, which is still in its early stages, will receive from European leaders, as well as whether U.S. industry and politicians will support the idea. An E.U. official declined to comment on Wednesday on the details of an active negotiation, but said the two sides were discussing ways to continue and deepen their work on the arrangement.

In recent weeks, trade tensions between the United States and Europe have risen to their highest levels since President Biden entered office, with leaders sparring over U.S. legislation aimed at encouraging the production of electric vehicles in North America. European leaders say the measures will put their industries at a disadvantage and have demanded changes that they say unfairly exclude European firms.

A senior trade official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the paper was not yet public, said that the spat over electric vehicles was unlikely to spill over into negotiations over steel and aluminum, and that the governments were closely aligned on the goal of taking carbon intensity into account when it came to trade."

Boyle

“Blue Skies,” T.C. Boyle’s 19th novel, opens with Cat, a would-be social media influencer living on the imperiled Florida coast, buying a pet Burmese python as a piece of “living jewelry” she hopes will boost her Instagram account. Having been denied her other hoped-for adornments (a baby or a dog or even a cat), she makes her reptilian purchase from the owner of a store regrettably named Herps, who promises, “Nothing’ll make you happier than having a snake in your life.”

Across the country in California, Cat’s mother, Ottilie, also seeks a capitalistic solution to her own emotional dilemma: the climate guilt laid on her by her son, Cooper, an entomologist who hectors her about “the death of the planet … the Anthropocene, our species a curse, et cetera.” Ottilie buys a countertop cricket reactor, planning to farm “high-fiber, low-fat protein” that she’ll gently slaughter in her freezer, lulling the insects “to their deaths in the most humane way possible.”

Many other striking and sometimes dangerous interactions with the wild and the barely domesticated follow, as the characters navigate a series of escalating ecological disasters. Willie, Cat’s Burmese python, is quickly lost and replaced by the even bigger Willie II, who, after the first Willie is found again, is forced to cohabitate with his smaller namesake. Cat, separated by a continent from her family for most of the novel, navigates a Florida downpour while being stalked by the “dull corrugated” shape of an eight-foot alligator. The morning of a funeral, she witnesses a pod of dolphins offshore, an “omen” that precedes her first new mosquito bite after a sudden, inexplicable die-off of insects around the world.

In the wake of a devastating court date, Cat swims in the Atlantic, plunging underwater to imagine breathing “water instead of air, dissolving into the blackness like the jellyfish and the octopi and every other agglomeration of cells careening on the currents.” It’s a communion Cat doesn’t fully comprehend, its spell broken by her absently stepping on “a thing as mysterious as the night, alive in its own skin,” a creature she never identifies: “Like a blessing, it was there and then it was gone.”"

How to Think Freely

What is the greatest obstacle to thinking freely, and how can you overcome it?

Nita Farahany: Robinson O. Everett, Distinguished Professor of Law & Philosophy and founding director, Initiative for Science & Society, Duke University; author, “The Battle for Your Brain: Defending the Right to Think Freely in the Age of Neurotechnology”

The coming age of neurotechnology will introduce widespread adoption of wearable brain-computer interface technology as the universal controller for our other technology. This presents our greatest obstacle to thinking freely, even as it expands human capabilities and allows us to address leading causes of human suffering. As governments, corporations and society rush to surveil, commodify and even change our brains, we will be driven to censor our thoughts, lest they be misused to ridicule, manipulate, or punish us for what we are thinking. We can preserve our right to think freely by recognizing an international human right to cognitive liberty.

Annie Murphy Paul: Author, “The Extended Mind: The Power of Thinking Outside the Brain”

The greatest obstacle to thinking freely is our neurocentric bias — our wrongheaded belief that thinking happens only inside the brain. The theory of the extended mind, proposed by the philosophers Andy Clark and David Chalmers, maintains that we think not only with our brains, but with a wide variety of “extra-neural” resources: our bodies, our physical surroundings, our relationships with other people and our tools and devices. We think more freely when we “think outside the brain” — that is, when we use these mental extensions with skill and intention."

For the first time in the nearly 90-year history of the United Auto Workers, the union is on strike against all three of the large Detroit automakers — General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler — at the same time.

The targeted strike, which started on Sept. 15 and expanded last Friday, has shut down three auto plants in Michigan, Ohio and Missouri, and 38 parts distribution centers operated by G.M. and Stellantis. About 18,300 U.A.W. members are on strike while the union demands a 40 percent pay increase. The shutdowns affect only a few car models, but a protracted strike would affect consumers and the U.S. economy.

Neal E. Boudette, who covers the auto industry from Detroit for The New York Times, has been reporting on the negotiations between the union and automakers. He has covered the automobile industry since 2002, when he was in Germany working for The Wall Street Journal. He joined The Times in 2016.

The U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit this week, the first one since 2014, comes as the world is struggling with urgent crises, some of which are having catastrophic effects on Africa. The continent is grappling with a food shortage worsened by both Russia’s war with Ukraine and supply chain problems arising from the Covid-19 pandemic.

But U.S. officials say they also want to discuss forward-looking topics such as commercial investments and technology that can have long-term benefits for the continent.

“Over the next few days, we will be announcing additional investments to make it easier for students to participate in exchange programs between our countries, to increase trade opportunities for members of the African diaspora and to support African entrepreneurs and small businesses,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said at the summit’s opening event, a forum for what the State Department called “African and diaspora young leaders.”"

Qatar is virtually tied with Australia and the United States as the largest producer of liquefied natural gas, fuel that is super chilled and shipped on tankers. Experts say Australian exports have likely peaked and some of its aging fields are beginning to decline. New export terminals are being built in the United States but at a relatively modest pace that has been limited partly by big investors who are less willing to put money into fossil fuels than they were a few years ago because of concerns about climate change.

Russia is also a major exporter of gas, much of which it has long sold to Europe via pipelines. But those exports have slowed to a trickle since Russia invaded Ukraine in February.

That leaves Qatar, a Middle Eastern monarchy with a population of just three million people, in prime position. Last year, the country started building four giant new production and export terminals, investments that will increase its export capacity more than a third by 2026. And officials have announced plans to build two more terminals later in the decade. All told, the country’s capacity to produce liquid natural gas will grow more than 60 percent to 126 million tons a year later in the decade.

The United States currently is slightly ahead of Qatar in export capacity, although exports have been hurt in recent months by an explosion at a Texas export terminal. Analysts expect U.S. export capacity to increase about 40 percent by 2026."

And if global aviation achieves the goal it adopted last year, then your 2050 flight from New York to Hong Kong will result in “net zero” carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

There’s no guarantee that the industry will get there, but the technologies being developed in pursuit of the target will change aviation, regardless of whether the goal is met.

In the years leading up to the pandemic, aviation emitted roughly a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, about as much as the entire continent of South America in 2021. And the figures are bouncing back as passengers return to the skies. But major airlines, including six of the largest U.S. airlines, have pledged to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, if not sooner. At a meeting in October of the United Nations agency dedicated to civil aviation, delegates from 184 countries adopted net zero by 2050 as a “long-term global aspirational goal.”

“Aspirational” is the operative word. Aviation is what experts refer to as a hard-to-abate sector, meaning there aren’t currently any easy, market-ready technologies that can drastically reduce its carbon emissions. And the “net” qualifier attached to the goal means that airlines can account for any CO2 they continue to emit either by using traditional carbon offsets, a practice that has attracted major criticism, or by capturing carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere."

Pockets of downtown Singapore can be more than 10 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than rural areas outside the city.

Singapore’s prime minister has described climate change as “life and death.” He has reason to worry: Stifling temperatures and humidity already last all year, and the city-state has warmed at twice the global average over the past six decades.

Heat like this isn’t just uncomfortable. It can cause chronic illness and death, including heat exhaustion, kidney damage and even heart attacks. With two-thirds of the global population expected to live in urban areas by 2050, urban heat is an enormous global health challenge.

Rapid urbanization has made Singapore hotter. A big part of the problem is how almost every global city is built.

Cities cut down trees and remove plants that provide shade and naturally cool the air.

They cover large areas with concrete and asphalt, which absorb heat during the day and release it at night.

They densely pack skyscrapers into urban canyons that limit wind flow and trap pockets of heat. Urban canyon

And their residents expel waste heat from gas car exhausts and air conditioners, helping to transform a hot day into an unbearable one.

Preventing climate change is out of Singapore’s control: The city-state emits less than 0.1% of global carbon emissions. But there is a surefire way to limit city temperatures, researchers say: Revive the natural processes that cooled the land before urbanization.

Most cities do not have Singapore’s wealth and centralized political system, which allow it to move quickly to build new infrastructure. But while some of Singapore’s strategies to reduce excess heat are expensive, many of them are straightforward, and cheaper than planning for, say, floods or hurricanes.

As temperature records were shattered around the world this summer, Singapore’s blueprint for slowing the urban impacts of extreme heat is gaining urgency.

A Cooler Building Buildings absorb and radiate heat, but Singapore is trying to cool them down. The V-shape design of this hospital funnels cool breezes from a neighboring pond, bringing cold air into the building without using air conditioning. The building integrates trees and plants in a central garden, on the rooftop, hanging from the facade. They provide shade and reduce the heat absorbed by the building from the sun. The plants also release water into the air as vapor, cooling the area down. They function like a conveyor belt moving heat from the ground high up into the air.

Researchers say that planting more trees is the most effective way to reduce a city’s temperature.

“If you wanted to invent the most effective kind of climate management technology from the ground up, you could spend a lot of time trying to do that. You would just engineer a tree,” said Brian Stone Jr., director of the Urban Climate Lab at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

The streets around the Khoo Teck Puat Hospital are lined with trees, and the central courtyard of the building is full of dense foliage. During the day, trees shield pedestrians from the beating sun and prevent the sun’s rays from warming the concrete sidewalk. At night, temperatures are lower, as there’s less heat released from the sidewalk.

In order to rely on trees to regulate climate stress, cities will need to treat them as infrastructure to ensure they are healthy and effective, according to Dr. Stone. That will come at a cost, but just a fraction of what cities spend on other environmental protections.

“It’s a real budget item, but it’s not out of proportion to what we already spend on environmental management in cities,” he said. “It’s less than 1 percent of what we spend maintaining storm sewers in L.A. every year.”

Singapore is also encouraging the integration of greenery directly into buildings by offering financial incentives for rooftop gardens and vertical green facades. The foliage works as natural blinds, shading the structure and insulating the building’s material from the heat, reducing the need for air conditioning.

Singapore has painted the roofs of some buildings with light-colored reflective paints, which absorb less heat and could reduce the ambient temperature around the buildings by up to 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit, initial studies suggest. A similar program in New York City has covered more than 10 million square feet of rooftops with reflective paints since 2009, reducing the need for air conditioning and the waste heat it generates.

Simple design decisions can also have a big impact on a building’s temperature.

Buildings in the new Jurong Lake District avoid directly facing the sun, cooling indoor temperatures. And architects are designing buildings that encourage cross-ventilation, which allows air to move from one side of a building to another, pushing hotter air out and bringing cooler air in.

“You can have a big area that’s not energy dependent on churning out lots of air conditioning to make it comfortable,” said Richard Hassell, founding director of WOHA Architects, which designed the Parkroyal hotel. “You can make it passively comfortable.”

There are limits to what can be achieved by rethinking a city only one building at a time. Even the most cutting-edge buildings can negatively influence their surroundings in unforeseen ways.

A new residential development with all the “bells and whistles” of efficient urban design could still make the neighborhood hotter if it blocks wind flow, said Winston Chow, principal investigator at Cooling Singapore, a research group.

“You’ve got a new residential development that cancels everything out, so it’s a net loss,” he said.

To tackle the urban heat island effect, it’s vital to not only improve the design of each building, but to consider its relationship with the surrounding city.

Extending Cooling Citywide Marina Bay was planned from scratch, giving the city the opportunity to design an entire new neighborhood with heat in mind. A 250-acre park, “Gardens by the Bay,” boasts a range of trees and other foliage that cool down the surrounding area. Research has shown that the bigger the green space, the bigger the cooling effect. Dense skyscrapers in downtowns often limit wind flow and trap heat, but here a mix of tall, medium and short buildings works like a sail to capture cool sea breezes and direct them to the pedestrian level. Twenty-three buildings are part of an interconnected cooling system that replaces the need for each building to use its own air conditioning.

One street in Singapore, known as “air conditioner alley,” demonstrates how a lot of poorly coordinated small decisions can compound to cause a big heat problem. Hundreds of air conditioning units all siphon hot air out of the apartments and businesses, onto the same narrow street.

“Air conditioner alley” in Singapore Rebecca Toh for The New York Times

A similar dynamic plays out in most cities with hot climates. Buildings are cooled one at a time, lowering their temperature at the expense of making the environment hotter.

Phoenix, Ariz., recorded 17 days at or above 115 degrees Fahrenheit in July, which was the hottest month ever recorded globally. Water bottles warped, devoted runners strapped on headlamps to jog at 4 a.m. and dozens of people died in surrounding Maricopa County from heat-related causes.

The design of the city made the brutal summer worse. While Phoenix has planted some trees in shadeless neighborhoods, overall it has few trees and large stretches of sun-absorbing asphalt. More than 1.3 million residents live in areas where the urban heat island exceeds 8 degrees, according to research by Climate Central.

Instead of cooling small spaces individually, Singapore’s Marina Bay, which was centrally planned, cools down many buildings at once by running chilled water through a network of insulated pipes. The district cooling network is far more efficient than multiple small A.C. units, reducing both energy consumption and waste heat.

Other cities have similar systems, including Paris, and so do some American college campuses. But to work efficiently, district cooling often requires coordination between multiple landowners and developers, and retrofitting existing structures is expensive. Singapore, which can centrally plan a large-scale new development like Marina Bay, has an advantage.

Large green spaces like parks are a more widely practical intervention, cooling areas beyond their boundaries, researchers say. Air temperature measurements show that Singapore’s 155-acre Bishan Park can be up to about 3 degrees cooler than high-density residential blocks in the middle of the city.

“The larger the park space, the further it penetrates into the residential areas as well,” said Mr. Chow from Cooling Singapore.

But even parks have their limits. Singapore has built out a more systematic solution, a network of green corridors that connect green spaces together and allow cool air to flow throughout the city.

Green corridors have been successful in other cities, including in Medellín, Colombia. The city has planted more than 880,000 trees across 30 corridors, which reportedly reduced the average air temperature in the corridors by more than 8 degrees Fahrenheit.

“A corridor can at least generate this kind of cool air circulation in a city. And the cool air can extend to the outside area, creating pockets of relief from the heat,” said Tamara Iungman, a researcher at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health.

Widely planting street-level trees along sidewalks across the city is the most effective solution to reduce temperature, according to researchers at the Urban Climate Lab.

“We can’t rely on a centralized, intense clustering of urban forests or microforest to provide cooling for the whole city. We really have to disperse,” said Dr. Stone from the Urban Climate Lab.

Can Singapore’s efforts to reduce urban heat islands actually outpace rising global temperatures? Probably not, local officials acknowledge. But holding temperatures steady would be a huge victory.

“I think we’re just trying to not see the increases that we anticipate if we don’t do anything,” said Adele Tan, deputy chief executive of Singapore’s Urban Redevelopment Authority.

Urban planners and policymakers are recognizing that inventions to cool down cities also help in other ways. Green corridors and large green spaces support biodiversity, provide recreational spaces for residents and aid flood prevention.

“It’s a pleasant surprise to be here at this moment in climate change, realizing that our number one intervention has all these other benefits,” Dr. Stone said."

With the war in Ukraine in its 16th month, Chancellor Olaf Scholz praised the security plan as “a big, big change in the way we deal with security issues.” The goal, he said, is to combine foreign, domestic and economic priorities, and to increase spending on the military.

The strategy was announced as a key part of the coalition agreement of the government when it took office in December 2021‌.

ezra klein

I’m Ezra Klein. This is “The Ezra Klein Show.” [MUSIC PLAYING] I have this frustration with the rhythm of how we cover American politics. I’ve had it for a very long time. It’s this — so we spend, in the press, all this time covering elections, and campaigns, and politicians. And then they get elected. And we cover their fights, and their legislative battles, and is the bill going to pass, and what’s happening to Build Back Better, and what is Joe Manchin doing. And then finally, sometimes, if you’re lucky, something big and good passes. And then we just move on. [LAUGHS] We just go on to the next thing. But bills don’t do all that much on their own. They actually have to be implemented. They have to become something real in the world to have the effect they were meant to have. And that’s where we are now in climate. Over the past two years, the Biden administration and the Democrats, they passed a huge series of climate bills. The Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act. It’s about $450 billion in climate investment. And behind that number, lurks all kinds of new agencies, and standards, and mandates and goals. And even more than that, those bills and that politics has been a signal to the private sector which is investing here, to lots of young people who are going into climate tech and climate activism, to all kinds of members of the building trades who are reorganizing and retooling and retraining to know how to build everything we’re going to need to build, to electrify, to weatherize. It’s big. What has to happen in the coming years is big. And we can’t just expect that it’ll happen on its own. So I’ve done, a couple of months ago, this big long conversation with Jesse Jenkins about the imagined path to decarbonization here, what the drafters of these bills hope will happen. I really recommend that conversation to understand the context. And I’ll put a link in show notes. But this conversation is different. This conversation is about how to make it happen. Something I’ve heard again and again in the past few months is that the climate movement is fracturing under the weight of its own success. Actually getting these bills done, actually moving to where you can implement them, now there are a lot of fights, now there’s a lot of really hard trade-offs that have to be made. But I really don’t think fracturing is the right term here. I think the right term is governing. Writing legislation forces choice. You got to make all these decisions. Massive coalitions that can come together in opposition or come together when what you’re passing or creating is imaginary. They always crack apart. They always find their deep tensions when they succeed and have to govern. But that is not a sign of weakness. It’s a sign of power. It happens to candidates all the time. They run for office as radicals promising to change the system. Then they win and they actually have to govern. And the trade-offs they make, and the compromises they have to make, and the fact that they need to make a budget work, it alienates a lot of their former allies. People who looked radical begin to look incremental. But at the same time, instead of the change they imagined just being a hypothetical, it begins to happen in the real world. Real people’s lives are made better. New groups and power centers join their coalition. These are transitions, not the solutions. Fracturing makes it sound like the movements are simply losing power. In truth, they’re gaining power. That’s where the climate movement and anyone working on climate is now. Enough bills have passed. Enough money has been set aside. Enough technologies have been created or are being created that we really do have a chance. It’s remarkable. We really do have a chance to avert the worst of global warming. But that means a movement that has spent most of its life learning how to stop terrible things from happening, it needs to become something different. A movement that builds real things in the real world at a breakneck pace. A movement that doesn’t just say yes, but figures out how to make all kinds of communities and groups and cities around the country say yes. Yes and yes and yes, again and again and again, faster than we have in decades. The climate movement has to govern now. They have to help this country build this whole infrastructure that they have imagined. And governing and building in this country, it is damn hard. But this should be, I think, a space not just for hope but for excitement. I mean, one reason I wanted to have this topic, this conversation right now, post-election, is that however the House turns out, these next two years are not going to be a period of passing major climate bills through Congress. There’s going to be a lot of paralysis, a lot of infighting. But that doesn’t mean the next two years will be a time of stasis. The next two years, and long beyond that, are going to be about making good on the promise of the legislation passed in 2021 and 2022. It’s going to be about building the world those bills promised to make. It’s going to be about actually getting us on a better path for our climate. There are very few people who have been as central to climate as an issue, to the way we understand climate and the challenges we’re facing, and to the climate movement as an organization, as an ecosystem, as Bill McKibben. His 1989 book, “The End of Nature,” it’s often compared to Rachel Carson’s “Silent Spring” and how big of an effect it had on this issue. He has ever since been one of the movement’s most important writers and thinkers but also activists and organizers. He did not just stand on the sidelines. He’s the founder of 350.org, one of the largest climate activist organizations in the world. He was a key leader in the fight to block the Keystone XL pipeline. And he’s been thinking, and reading, and organizing, and working, and trying to see what the movement has to become next, what has to happen next. So I wanted to have him on the show to talk about the new era of the climate movement, the new era we’re in in climate politics, and what all of us will have to do to meet this moment. As always, my email ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. [MUSIC PLAYING] Bill McKibben, welcome to the show.

bill mckibben

Well, what a pleasure to get to be with you, Ezra.

ezra klein

So we’re talking a couple of days after the midterm election, which I think many people on the left feel did not go as badly as they worried it would. But you were saying to me that it maybe went better than not as badly as people worried it would. So tell me what you saw.

bill mckibben

I mean, in a sense, since I’m here in Egypt at the climate summit, I’m thinking about it in global terms. And it’s one of several straws in the wind this last few weeks that at least give one outside reason to hope that maybe some of the fever around the world has begun to break a little bit. I mean, I’m probably the wrong person to be saying this since I’ve spent most of my life as a professional bummer-outer of other people, but, though by narrow margins, the forces of democracy and the guise of the Democrats did pretty well in the midterms. By the narrowest of margins, Lula defeated Bolsonaro in Brazil. Huge victory for the planet. And we have news in the last day or two that Vladimir Putin is at least removing his troops from the one big city he managed to capture, some speculate in response to the midterms and the understanding that he’s not going to have a G.O.P. majority to cut off funding to the Ukraine. All of these things are deeply tied to the climate and energy story. So I guess I just am very hopeful that maybe someday some of the fever that has engulfed the world these last seven or eight years may break enough that we can begin to take rational action about things.

ezra klein

I’ll note something that occurred to me as you were saying that, which is an inversion, at least in America, of the way we traditionally saw the politics of some of these issues. So I go back a couple of years. And I think the idea was health care is a popular issue for Democrats. If they do something on health care, give people health insurance, give people Medicaid, it’s going to look great. Climate is this elite issue. Nobody really cares about it. It’s something that the Nancy Pelosis of the world want to do. And if you’ve got a big majority, maybe you can force something like that through, but you’re probably going to pay for it. But you go back to 2010, Democrats pass a massive near universal health care bill. They get, as Obama famously says, shellacked in the next election. And you look over the past two years, the main thing Joe Biden does, the core of his legislative agenda is a series of bills on climate, culminating in the Inflation Reduction Act, which has a huge amount of climate work in it. And Democrats do just fine in the election. There’s nothing like the backlash to the climate agenda that there was to Obamacare. That’s an interesting fact about our politics right now.

bill mckibben

Well, I think the real tell, in a way, is that the Republicans weren’t running against the Inflation Reduction Act at all. They hardly mentioned it. And the reason for that is that the zeitgeist has shifted. Partly that’s been the work of movements that we’ve built over the last decade since the last time that Congress failed to do anything about climate change back in 2009. Part of it’s been the ongoing educational efforts of mother nature who keeps hitting us upside the head with the two-by-four. And partly, it’s the fact that as renewable energy has gotten cheaper, it’s gotten more and more popular. One of the very few things that you find consistently high levels of polling support for among Republicans, Democrats and independents is more support for solar energy. People love solar panels. They may love them for different reasons. I think sometimes that conservatives think that with the solar panel on their house, their home is finally their castle and they don’t have to deal with anyone ever again. And I think liberals like the idea that the groovy power of the sun is connecting us all. But those kind of differences one can work with. And I think that there may be some room in our politics now. It won’t be easy, because, as we should discuss, the fossil fuel industry has by no means given up and will continue to try and slow the assault on their business model. But there is an opening here.

ezra klein

I want to pick up on that, because the impetus for this conversation was exploring how the climate reality, the climate decarbonization technology, climate legislation and, thus, the climate movement are going to have to change in this new era, and change because of result of success, not because of result of failure. You wrote an essay for The New Yorker earlier this year, where you argued that we are living through the really major transition point in how we address climate change and what needs to be done. Tell me a bit about that shift.

bill mckibben

[CHUCKLES] Well, I mean, what I said in The New Yorker was we’re at the point where we might well be able to end the 700,000-year habit of setting things on fire. Fire has been good for human beings. We learned to cook food, which let us get bigger brains. We were able to migrate north and south away from the Equator. The anthropologists even think that gathering around the campfire helped build the bonds that make us a social species. And once we learned to burn coal and gas and oil with the Industrial Revolution, we produced modernity and the prosperity that came with it. But now burning stuff has turned into a big problem. There’s climate change. There’s the direct health effects. The new data indicates that nine million people a year die from breathing the combustion byproducts of fossil fuel, which isn’t hard to believe if you’ve spent any time recently in Delhi or Shanghai. And we have the problem exemplified by Putin, the way that fossil fuel and autocracy seem to be closely linked. The good news is we don’t need to be burning stuff anymore. In the last decade, engineers have brought down the price of renewable energy about 90 percent. The cheapest way to generate power on planet Earth is to point a sheet of glass at the sun. That’s an extraordinary breakthrough. We could stop combustion, stop the spark in your spark plug, stop the fire that’s burning in your basement to heat your home, stop the fire that most of us have in our kitchens to cook our food, and replace it with the fact that the good Lord hung a large ball of burning gas 93 million miles away in the sky and we know how to use it. We can capture its rays directly in photovoltaic panels. We can take advantage of the fact that it differentially heats the Earth, creating the winds that turn those turbines. We now have the batteries to store that power when the sun goes down or the wind drops. So we’re at a moment when we could make dramatic, rapid change. And boy, do we need to, because unlike every other political issue that we’ve almost ever faced, we have a time to test with climate change. I mean, we’ve been talking about, say, national health care as long as I’ve been alive. And to our great shame, we’ve never gone all the way there. Some day, doubtless, we’ll join other industrialized countries in guaranteeing health care as a right. People will have died or gone bankrupt in the meantime, but it won’t be harder to do it because we delayed when we finally get around to it. Climate change isn’t like that. Once you’ve melted the Arctic, no one has a very good plan for how you freeze it back up again. And the scientists have told us that if we want to keep on track to the targets we set in Paris seven years ago, we’ve got to halve emissions by 2030, which, by my watch, is seven years and seven weeks away.

ezra klein

So to signpost this conversation, one thing I want to draw out here are some of the tensions, the trade-offs, the choices, the transitions that are going to face climate governance and climate thinking in the coming years. And I want to draw out one from that answer in particular, because there has been a tension between those who say the only way to handle climate change is to accept our limits as a species, to accept a future of — you might call it less, or you might call it a climate austerity, but you might just call it limits — a smaller world — and those who say we can transcend those limits, we can decouple the technologically-advanced, materially-abundant lives we lead from setting things on fire in order to harness the energy to make the things we want. And one thing that I think can be missed in this conversation is that the case for accepting limits was very, very, very strong for a very long time because we didn’t know how to make cheap solar energy, or cheap wind energy, or advanced geothermal or other things. But that’s changing a bit. And I’d be curious to hear your personal evolution on this. I mean, you wrote a book — one of your early books was about having fewer children in order to impose less stress on the environment. But I get the sense reading you that you’ve moved more towards this decoupling perspective. So tell me a bit about how you’ve seen this change in yourself and in the world around you in the past couple of decades.

bill mckibben

So I’ve written a lot over the years about economic growth and about whether or not it’s done all the things that it’s told us [LAUGHS] it was going to do. And I have some real doubts about that. I wrote a book once called “Deep Economy,” and it was a real attempt to figure out whether the world that we’re building, a world of infinite constant growth, actually makes us particularly happy, and the evidence is not all that great. But the physics of climate change enforces a certain brute reality in one’s set of solutions. And the timing question is the single biggest enforcer of that reality. We have to make very, very rapid change. And so changes in basic human desires or even changes in the physical setup of our world around us come, if they come at all, more slowly. I think in 100 years, it’s unlikely human beings will be amusing themselves by consuming immense amounts of stuff. I think we’re likely to have moved beyond that. But in seven years, I doubt it. I think, for the moment, we’re stuck with things like the suburb, where I grew up, and the physical limits that it enforces on us, which means lots of people driving cars. So we better figure out how to make electric cars work, at least for now. And we better do it very quickly. So I think that we’ve been given a tremendous gift. It’s not a free lunch. It comes with many costs that we can describe, but survival and demands that we move quickly. And here’s the real, I think, moral way to think about this — the survival that’s most at risk at the moment is the survival of the people and places that have done the least to cause this problem. Those of us who have caused it by pouring carbon into the air for several generations need now to, at the very least, move very quickly to make sure that our lives, our institutions, our societies aren’t making that problem still worse.

ezra klein

Do you mind if I wander us down an alley on the metaphor of growth for a moment?

bill mckibben

[LAUGHS] Sure.

ezra klein

So I’ve been thinking a bit about this for a book project that I’m doing and some of the work I’ve been doing. And I’ve been thinking about how much I hate the term “growth” and, in particular, how much I hate the metaphor of growing the pie. And the reason I dislike both of them is that they imply a sameness but a moreness, right? Growing the pie — if you grow a pie — if I have an apple pie and now I have more apple pie, what I have is more apple pie, but the same pie. And the thing that we’re describing with the term “growth,” which is a metaphor from the physical world — I mean, I have small children, they grow. But they are my children but bigger. But growth as we talk about it in the economy or over long periods of time is actually about difference not sameness. When we grow at a fast rate, what it means is the future is much more different than the past or the present than it would be otherwise. And I think it’s important to this conversation because one of the questions about growth, what makes growth of certain kinds interesting here, is exactly something you were saying a couple of minutes ago. Growth may not mean just more setting of things on fire, which is what it has meant for a very, very, very long time in human history. If we get the kind of growth, but much more to the point, the kind of change that many of us are hoping for, what you get is a future built on very different technologies with very different possibilities. Cars that work in different ways, and heating systems that work in different ways, and ways of moving people around the world that work in different ways. And I just think it gets very missed because there are versions of growth that are very destructive and there are versions of what get called growth that are very productive. But really what you’re talking about is directions. Do you want to keep moving in the same direction or do you want to try to move in a different direction? And I think the whole language of growth has really obscured the question of direction.

bill mckibben

I think that’s very smart. I mean, when you think about your kids, if they didn’t grow at all next year, you’d take them to the doctor and ask why. But if your kids — I mean, my daughter’s 29 now. If she grew 6 inches next year, I’d take her to the doctor, too. It’s a bad metaphor in that way. And in certain ways, we can imagine growing or doing things differently in ways that allow us to shrink. So here’s an example, and it’s a number that really stuck in my mind when I figured it out about a year ago. So 40 percent of all the ship traffic in the world is simply carrying coal and oil and gas back and forth across the seas so that someone can burn it someplace. If we move to renewable energy, you don’t need that. Now, look, you’re going to have to ship a blade for your windmill. But once it gets to Kansas and is there spinning in the breeze, you won’t need a new one for hopefully a quarter century. So that’s a kind of visual example of what it might be like to live in a world that was changing in the direction that allowed us to use less. Now, there’s no free lunch here. We’re going to go have to mine lithium and cobalt to make these things happen. And we should figure out how to do that as well as we can and as humanely as we can. And there’s no excuse not to do those things. But the difference is that, at the moment, the stuff we mine, we immediately consume. If you mine lithium and make a solar panel with it, it catches the energy every day for the next 25 years when the sun rises above the horizon. That’s very different from mining coal, which you set on fire and then have to go mine again the next day. That’s the reason that this is so hopeful. It’s also the reason the fossil fuel industry hates it so much and have fought so hard against it, because their business model for a hundred years has been making you write a check every time you need some more energy. And for them, the idea that the sun would deliver it for free is just the stupidest business model there ever was.

ezra klein

I had intended to come to this a bit later in our conversation, but since you brought it up, let me do it now. Whenever I talk on the show about decarbonization, I get a number of emails about the evils of lithium mining, in particular, but cobalt mining would fit in there, et cetera. We talk about renewables. We talk about solar. We talk about wind. You mentioned pointing a plate of glass at the sun. But it does require these rare Earth materials. It does require production chains. And there’s a view many hold that the level of mining and resource extraction and production and land use necessary to build this decarbonized, quote unquote, “clean energy future” is simply another form of environmental destruction and human recklessness. You’ve looked at this quite closely. How do you answer that concern?

bill mckibben

Well, it does come with some environmental destruction. Everything that humans do does. So the question is, does it come with less or does it come with more? Mark Jacobson at Stanford, who I think has been proven so far to be the most reliable calculator of these things, estimates that the total mining burden on a planet that ran on renewable energy would drop by about 80 percent. That’s the direct reflection of the fact that when you mine for coal or drill for oil, you have to keep doing it over and over and over again because you consume it. So none of it’s beautiful or pretty. No one’s ever going to make, no matter what they do, a mine that’s clean and attractive. And we should be careful about where we site them and how we site them, and we should be especially careful about the human rights abuses that too often have accompanied mining of all kinds. But we also should understand that we are in an emergency, and that when you’re in an emergency, you act on the ways that you have to act. Nine million people a year die from breathing the combustion byproducts of fossil fuel. That alone would give you lots and lots and lots of reason to take steps in another direction. Add to that the fact that climate change is the first truly existential risk that we’ve faced as a globe. If we don’t get it right, the death toll is measured in numbers we can’t even imagine. The U.N. estimates that unchecked climate change on the kind of path we’re on at the moment would produce a billion climate refugees or more by the middle or end of this century. Try to imagine that world. Try to imagine the instability, chaos, destruction of that kind of planet. And when you do, the incentives for moving quickly in the direction of sun and wind seem profound.

ezra klein

This speaks to a tension, I would say in the environmental movement, but I also think in a lot of just normal people’s thinking on these issues when confronted with some of the more specific questions of how we decarbonize, which is the environmental movement, as I understand it, is very much formed on the idea of conservation. Conservation of the ecology in which we live, the lands that we love and enjoy, the ecosystems as they exist. And we’ve also talked for some time about conservation of the climate. Conservation of the climate that in this very, very narrow band has fostered all of human civilization. But as we’ve moved to this place where we have very cheap solar and wind power, and we can think about geothermal and nuclear, and we can talk about things like carbon capture — but as we move to this place where we can potentially power the civilization we have — and an even larger one than that — it seems to me these ideas are diverging. You can imagine a world where we conserve our climate nearly. We’re not going to stay stable. But in a great world at 1.5 degrees, maybe more likely 1, 2-ish degrees, but we do that with quite a lot of building over and through the land that, in other guises, the environmental movement was built to conserve. So you have this tension between conserving the climate and conserving the spaces. How do you think about that?

bill mckibben

Well, I confess that sometimes it makes me grumpy. I love my state of Vermont where I live, and I love the people in it. And I love the fact that they’re environmentally-attuned, which means that they love the landscape. But earlier this year, or late last year, the public utility commission in Vermont turned down a solar farm solely on the grounds of aesthetics, that people didn’t want to look at it. I don’t think that that’s OK anymore. In a world that we live in, in the kind of emergency we face, we need to have some change in that aesthetic. If you look at a wind turbine spinning on a hill, you have to be able to think there’s something beautiful about it. That it’s the breeze made visible and that it’s a sign that you’re taking some kind of responsibility for your own energy. Part of this is just a kind of status quo bias. So for instance, it’s going to take a certain amount — not a huge amount — but a certain amount of farmland to put up solar panels and windmills. That’s not ideal perhaps. But think about what it’s used for now. 60 percent of the cornfields in Iowa, some of the richest topsoil on the face of the Earth — 60 percent of that corn is just being turned into gasoline at the moment. It’s converted into ethanol and stuck in cars. With a tiny fraction of that land base, you could produce enough electricity through solar panels to provide the same mileage for electric cars. And when you do it, you’re growing a crop — electrons — that we badly need, instead of a crop — corn — that we actually have so much of that most of it gets turned either into gasoline, or to high fructose corn syrup, or fed to cows. Not only that, in order to produce it, you have to pour nitrogen on those soils that washes into rivers and streams and produces big dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico. Looked at one way, a set of solar panels on some of that land is a kind of Sabbath for those places. It’s not going to destroy the landscape. In fact, it’s going to let it lie fallow for a little while, maybe a generation or two until people have developed whatever is going to come next — small modular nuclear reactors or tidal power or whatever. But the thing that we have now to get us through this absolute bottleneck in human history is solar panels, wind turbines, and the batteries to store their power. That’s the stuff that we can build fast and cheaply. And it’s the only stuff that we can build fast and cheaply and that will get things done at scale. Now, I don’t know whether we can do it quickly enough. We can talk about all the obstacles that stand in the way. And the number of analogues for when we’ve done stuff at this pace are fairly few and far between. I wrote a piece years ago looking in some detail at exactly what America did in the two years before it entered and after it entered World War II in order to ramp up industrial production of tanks and planes and things. That’s really the only analog we’ve got to moving at the scale and the pace that we need to go. And so there’s no guarantee that it’s going to be done, especially since the fossil fuel industry will do what it can at every turn to stand in the way. But at least the passage of this Inflation Reduction Act this summer has given us some of the money that we need to work on it. And so now we’ll find out whether execution and deployment are possible at that scale and that speed. My guess is that the limiting factors are going to be, A, whether we can overcome the fossil fuel industry’s meddling, and, B, whether we can build out, above all, the human capital that we need. I mean, the best estimate is it’s going to take at least a million more electricians in the U.S. If you know a young person who wants to do something that’s going to help the world and wants to make a good living at the same time, tell them to go become an electrician. [MUSIC PLAYING]

ezra klein

To go back to the idea of there being directions, not just growth, if you look at growth between 1980 and 2000 and you look at growth between 2000 and 2020, there are differences in the numbers, but they’re not dramatic. But if you look at the directions of what was happening in the energy systems, they are very, very, very dramatic. And what gives us a shot here is the kinds of technological advances we’ve seen and, as you say, specifically solar, wind, batteries. You’ve written quite a bit about this. Give me a sense of the scale of it and the cause of that rapid change.

bill mckibben

Absolutely. The cause of the rapid change is what economists call a learning curve. And it’s one of the most remarkable things that there is if you have a technology that gets on a learning curve. Our first solar panels came in the 1950s, and they were built for satellites, the first generation of satellites. And so, of course, they were unbelievably expensive. [LAUGHS] Tens of thousands of dollars a watt. But ever since then, and pretty steadily, engineers have been managing to bring down that cost. And it hasn’t been one particular breakthrough that’s done it. It’s been the steady accretion of technological innovation year after year after year after year. And at some point in the last four or five years, we passed the point on that curve where that energy became cheaper than the energy provided by fossil fuels. Because fossil fuels aren’t on a curve like that. They were pretty cheap to begin with, but they haven’t gotten cheaper. If anything, they get more expensive because now you have to go back further in the mine to find the coal. Now you have to drill down beneath the Gulf of Mexico to find the oil.

ezra klein

I often hear the story told as the heroic efforts of engineers and technologists. And in some versions, I hear — you even hear this as the heroic efforts of engineers and technologists pitted against a climate movement, which is, at best, focused on the wrong things like blocking pipelines, and, at worst, actively harmful, actively impeding technological progress. And I don’t know, when I look at it, it always looks much more complex to me, given all the policies that got passed by the environmental movement, given the cultural force they managed to bring to climate change, which changed a lot of what people decided to spend their lives doing. But you’ve been reporting on the technology of this for years. You’ve been a major part of the climate movement on the activism side. I’d like to hear a little bit about your sense or your observations of the interactions between the two.

bill mckibben

Sure. Well, let’s just — for a minute, let’s just talk about movements in the climate movement in general. At some level, it’s completely irrational that we had to have one. I can remember when Jim Hansen testified before Congress in 1988. And the next year I wrote the first book about all this. It wasn’t like there was a — it didn’t feel like there was going to be the need for a climate movement. Everyone was in agreement that we were going to go to work. The Republican president of the United States, George H.W. Bush said we will fight the greenhouse effect with the White House effect. Pretty good line. We now know that the fossil fuel industry, whose scientists had informed them in great detail about what was going on with climate change and whose executives had believed those scientists — Exxon, we now know, began building all its drilling rigs higher to compensate for the rise in sea level they knew was in coming — in the offing. They decided to build, across the industry, this architecture of deceit and denial and disinformation that kept us locked for 30 years in this entirely sterile debate about whether or not global warming was real, a question that both sides knew the answer to from the start, it’s just one of them was willing to lie. And that lie was powerful. It prevented serious action and policy for decades. And it took me a long time to figure out what was happening. I was a writer. And writers tend to think, I think, that if we win the argument, then that’s what’s essential and that good action will follow. It took me too long to figure out that we had won the argument, but we were losing the fight. Because the fight wasn’t about data, nor reason, nor evidence. It was about money and power. And therefore, we had to build some power of our own. And that’s when a lot of this movement-building got underway when more and more of us realized that. And we built it where we could. There was no way in 2009 or something, there was not a way to get good policy through Congress. We didn’t even — the Senate wouldn’t even take a vote on things like cap and trade because they knew it would lose. And so we built movements slowly and patiently, much too slowly for our taste. We did things like fight pipelines, build this fossil fuel divestment campaign that’s become the largest corporate campaign of its kind in history. I’ve been to jail on towards a dozen times. And every time, as I’ve found myself in handcuffs, I’ve thought, this is incredibly stupid. This is not what we should have to do in order to get our leaders to take seriously questions of physics — of simple physics about which there is robust agreement within the scientific community. But that’s what we did have to do. So now we’re at a point when the zeitgeist has shifted enough that there’s public policy that’s producing money that will continue to spur innovation and allow us to move and deploy more quickly. We’re going to have to keep up the political fight as well because — I mean, to give you an example, Third Act, this group that we founded in the last year for people over 60, like me, to get them engaged in fights to save the climate and democracy. We’re taking on the four big American banks — Chase, Citi, Wells Fargo, BofA — because they’re the four biggest funders to the fossil fuel industry in the world. And they continue to pour money into these projects and vast amounts of money. And when they do, they will lock us into a fossil fuel future far past the point where scientists think is safe. So we’re going to continue that kind of advocacy. But we’re also — people are fanning out across America to try and figure out how to speed up deployment, how to make this stuff really happen. So there are people who are hard at work arguing with their local school boards about whether or not to deploy electric school buses. There are people at state public utility commissions all the time now urging them, imploring them to force the utilities to start making change in how they produce energy, on and on and on. So the movement necessarily shifts as conditions shift, but that movement, those people coming together were what allowed us to get to the place where we are now in the time that we got here. So God bless them for it. And now we’ll see if we can move fast enough. The question about pace is a scary one, Ezra. I mean, we wasted 30 years. Now we have to move incredibly fast. We may have wasted more than 30 years. In my last book, which was as close to a memoir as I’ll ever write, I did some reporting back on what seems to me the most important election in my lifetime — my first election I got to vote in when Ronald Reagan beat Jimmy Carter. And Jimmy Carter, in his budget for the next year, if he’d been elected, had set aside money — quite a bit — to put America on the path to producing 20 percent of its energy from solar power by the year 2000. Had we done that, or anything like it, had we made that effort and gotten going then, there was no physical obstacle that stood in the way of progress, no miracle invention that hadn’t happened yet. We would have been in an entirely different place now. We wouldn’t have solved climate change, but we’d be right on the road to doing it. So there’s just no way to divorce the need for political pressure from the ability to change.

ezra klein

That brings up a pretty big transition that the climate movement is undergoing and will have to undergo, which is climate movement, like the environmental movement broadly, was built around blocking things. I mean, you go back to early environmental movement efforts — stop building over wetlands, stop destroying habitats for endangered species. You go to the climate movement, it’s stop building this pipeline, stop building this fossil fuel project. And now all of a sudden you have this dizzying inversion of what is needed, which is building and building and building and building. Building at a pace and scale that we have not seen in generations, maybe arguably we have not seen ever. The number of transmission lines, of solar panel arrays, of wind farms. Tell me a bit about the differences in organizations and tactics between stopping something from happening and helping to make something happen.

bill mckibben

Yeah, it’s a good question that we don’t entirely know the answer to yet and how it’s going to look. But what people have done so far is try to stop a truly dangerous technology — fossil fuel combustion — and they figured out lots and lots of ways to do that. Now we have to figure out how to channel the demand for energy, which remains, into clean energy. And we have to do it, as I’ve said repeatedly now because it scares me, over the constant efforts of the fossil fuel industry to slow that down. Look, they know that their business model isn’t going to last forever. 75 years from now, we’re going to run the planet on sun and wind or some other clean energy because it’s cheap. But if it takes us anything like 75 years to get there, the planet we run on sun and wind is going to be a broken planet. So our job is to make that transition happen as quickly as possible. And it’s going to be hard. Now, it can’t be done, I think, without real recognition of the fact that the fossil fuel industry took a particular toll on Indigenous communities, on poor communities, on vulnerable communities. So we have to build this new one — the sacrifices that should come should not, again, land most heavily on those communities. And one of the good things about the Inflation Reduction Act is that it lays out more explicitly than before in public policy a real effort to guide funding to those communities, to let them get some of the good things — the jobs and stuff that will come with this transition.

Let me ask about something you mentioned a moment ago, which is something that frightens you — the ways in which fossil fuel companies still might or want to stand in the way of this building. I’m not saying that isn’t true. In many cases, it is true. And they are fearsomely capable at wielding political power. But I also think that’s not the whole truth. A lot of what stands in the way of the kinds of building we’re going to need is just people. People who don’t want a large solar array right next to them. People who don’t want to see land they like turned into something they don’t really care about. People who are afraid of what this kind of building might mean. People who don’t want to see lithium mining. Sometimes it’s folks organized — organized into a specific community of a tribe or an interest group, or the committee to save Beverly Hills, or whatever it might be. And we have different levels of sympathy maybe for different levels of those associations. But a lot of the work here is actually just city by city, county by county, place by place, going to these local planning board meetings and trying to neutralize, convince, buy off, whatever it might be, just neighbors who have a lot of power over what gets built. I mean, the reason housing doesn’t get built in San Francisco is not because the fossil fuel companies won’t allow us to put up apartment buildings. It’s because people in San Francisco don’t want a bunch more housing built here. Or maybe they do, just not right where they are, not where it might affect their view. And when I ask about what the climate movement is going to have to become in order to deal with this, that’s sort of what I’m getting at too. I mean, there was a story — and they eventually backed down — but a local affiliate of the Sunrise Movement joined in arguing for a moratorium on solar development because they’re just like too much was being built in the local forest. And so — I don’t know — I think there’s a pretty big difference between the urgency people feel about solving this problem and then what happens when you say, well, part of the solution to this problem is going to happen down the block from you. And that’s where it seems you really are going to need both good policy but also a movement that’s there to try to be the affirmative voice for this kind of building and this kind of emergency setting. But that does not seem to me to be what the movement is set up to do. And worse than that, I do think there are elements of the environmental movement that end up on the other side. I mean, I think about the policy in Minneapolis to end single-family zoning being sued and stopped for a period of time by the Audubon Society out there. So how do you think about that transition in tactics and also in thinking?

bill mckibben

First thing is don’t underestimate the effect of the fossil fuel industry on trying to build that kind of opposition. Some of the big think tanks funded by the fossil fuel industry are the ones rolling out these programs of rural resistance, and setting up scoreboards, and going around community to community trying to encourage people to oppose these things, often with completely bogus arguments. Now, there may be limits to that effectiveness. And I think that there are ways that we can counter it. Among other things, the economic good that renewable energy does for community after community is a story that eventually gets told in a lot of places. And you’ll notice one of the reasons why the Republicans have not been as outspoken about renewable energy as you might expect is because there’s a number of places — Kansas, Texas, Iowa, parts of Oklahoma — where this has become a real and serious economic force of its own. That will grow over time. My guess is that one of the effects of the I.R.A. will be to eventually produce enough lobbyists for solar and wind companies that they’ll begin to have serious power on Capitol Hill. But yeah, you also have to be doing this place by place and town by town. And it’s going to be hard. It’s going to require people trying to develop a new sense of aesthetic of what is beautiful. It’s going to require the economics of it really working for local communities so that not all the value is captured by the out-of-state developer that’s coming in to build the solar panel. If you look at places that have really succeeded at this — examples like Denmark — one of the things that they did very right was allow, indeed encourage, some of the investment and some of the return to come from and go to local communities, church organizations, so on and so forth. We’re also going to see big and useful shifts in how we deal with these technologies. The best place to put them, if we can, is up on rooftops. That’s going to require — because it’s more expensive to do than build or raise in fields, that’s going to require lots of civic institutions figuring out how to aggregate demand. At the moment, it costs about $4 a watt to put it up on your roof as opposed to about $1.80 a watt or so to stick it out in a farmer’s field. And the main reason for that is because the acquisition costs, as the marketers say, of finding customers willing to put it on their roof are expensive. You’ve got to pay a lot of guys to go door to door talking to people. But we can get around that if civic groups and things do much of the vetting and much of that consolidating. There’s a group called Solar United Neighbors that’s hard at work on doing just that. So yeah, there’s plenty of work to be done. And it’s good work that will result in lower costs for people and lower impact on the environment. And we’re going to need to roll it out in all kinds of ways. And that’s, I think, going to be one of the tasks of the next few years. My guess is that there’s not going to be, any time soon, huge efforts to get Congress to do more, pass another bill or anything. I think most people understand that it took 34 years to get the Inflation Reduction Act between the time that Jim Hansen testified in Congress and the time that Congress finally acted. That’s a symbol of the dysfunction of our politics. And my guess is that that’s not going to be the focus of environmentalist efforts. The focus — a lot of it’s going to be around this deployment, around this execution. To the degree that there are big activist campaigns coming, I think they’re going to be aimed less at politics than at finance to try and make sure that they’re no longer funding fossil fuel expansion and that they are funding, as much as is humanly possible, the build-out, not just here, but around the world, of renewable energy. It does not do much good to solve this problem in America alone. We need to be able to do it everywhere. And that’s going to require, among other things, lots of money. Now, that money is mostly going to be private capital seeking return and that’s OK. But we have to structure it in such a way that this stuff gets built and built at terms that are advantageous to the people who need it most. [MUSIC PLAYING]

ezra klein

I want to draw out another of the core tensions here. And as I draw it out, I want to say really, really clearly that I don’t think it has an easy answer. It’s something that I’ve been working around a lot. And it’s the most, to me, morally and politically complicated question in all of this, which is the tension between speed and voice. We talk a lot now, when we’re talking about housing, when we’re talking about clean energy build-out, when we’re talking about the construction of all the different things we need, to have a more just society about the ways in which local homeowners or community members will show up at these meetings that most people skip and say, hey, I don’t want this and actually be able to stop it. And then we look at that multiplied out 100, 1,000 times and think, oh, something’s really going wrong in our society. So that leads you then to this idea that maybe we have a little bit too much of this kind of nonrepresentative voice. Maybe we need policies and processes that allowed for more speed, for more building, for more discretion on the part of political leaders. But there’s also real reasons we’ve moved to having so much voice, we’ve moved having so many opportunities for community input. They’re may be best utilized by more powerful communities, richer communities. Very, very hard to build new housing in Georgetown in Washington, D.C., for instance. But they also are there to protect weaker communities that have traditionally been steamrolled in these projects. How do you think about, how do you balance, how do you imagine the activism around somehow balancing the needs like the moral need to have voice in a democracy and the simultaneous moral need to be building the things so that the people of the future, or the people who don’t have the power to have a voice now, have a livable climate and world in which to flourish?

bill mckibben

Well, I think you begin by trying to make sure that the burden doesn’t fall on the people that the burden has always fallen upon in the past. And that’s moral and practical. But I also think that you need to keep telling the story of why this change is required. Movement building of any kind is essentially another form of storytelling. Now, you’re right, it’s difficult because the benefit doesn’t come immediately and specifically to you from making these changes. And the costs, when you perceive them as costs — I have to look at a solar panel — do come immediately to you. And I don’t exactly know how one gets around that except by continuing to try and persuade and convince people that this is change that’s necessary in the greater good and in the interest, maybe above all, of their kids and grandkids. We’ve been doing this work now for a year at Third Act with older people who are usually considered to be the most conservative members of our society. We’re finding an enormous receptivity training people by the thousands to go sit at public service commission meetings and things like that. And the thing that unites people is this deep sense around legacy, around the fact that they have kids and grandkids and they’re scared about what their world is going to look like. Legacy seems like an abstract concept. But it’s really not. It’s the legacy is the world you leave behind for the people you love the most. And right now, that’s a world that’s going to be shabbier than the world that we found. And that’s not a legacy people want. So trying to figure out, in the end, how to persuade people to think not as individuals all the time and only about their own immediate interest, but to think about the larger interest. Well, I mean, this is the task of almost all good politics. And it’s why that Carter/Reagan election seems so crucial to me. That was the moment when we, I think, abandoned, for a while, the idea of America as a group project and embarked instead on the idea that we were each supposed to maximize our own self-interest and that would produce a better future. It hasn’t produced a better future. It’s melted the Arctic. So now we need to figure out how to get past that. And I will say that I think that whatever the combination of Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden that we see reflected in things like the Inflation Reduction Act is an attempt to do that. That bill and especially the larger Build Back Better bill that Manchin shrunk it down from, those aren’t efforts to do Obama-era policy or Clinton-era policy. Those are efforts to do L.B.J.-era policy, to really use the power of all of us collected together in the government to try and build a better society. And we’re going to need to build on that, if we can. It’s fragile and it may not work. And I’m not telling you it’s going to work. I mean, as I said before, the name of the very first book that I wrote and that anybody wrote about climate change had the cheerful title, “The End of Nature,” because we may not make this happen in time. But we sure better try.

ezra klein

I was interested to hear you a moment ago say that the Inflation Reduction Act was an amalgam of Biden and Sanders, because as you, I think, then noted, very much also an amalgam of Joe Manchin. And the I.R.A. passed. And then part of the deal that Manchin extracted was that this permitting reform bill that he was excited about would get attached to must-pass legislation. And that bill had a couple of main provisions. It had a reduction in time for environmental reviews. It had a carve-out for this big natural gas pipeline that he’s been wanting to see happen. It had new powers for the regulatory authority that governs electrical transmission lines to be able to build more and particularly build more into regionally and interstate. Huge fight happened over this. It ended up dying. I found this to be a very, very complicated question. There was good in that bill — I’d like to say the permitting reforms on transmission. There was bad in the bill like the carve-out for the pipeline. You opposed the bill. Tell me a little bit about your opposition to the bill and how it left you thinking about permitting reform.

bill mckibben

I opposed it mostly because of that carve-out for the pipeline and for other efforts that were included in it to make more oil and gas expansion possible and to speed it up. Because the one thing we can’t afford, by any stretch of the imagination, is more oil and gas infrastructure. And this was, by the way, just almost absurdly obnoxious bill in that regard. I mean, it literally instructed federal agencies how they were supposed to respond to complaints about — what they were supposed to say in response to environmental complaints about this pipeline. And then it assigned it to a particular court that Manchin figured would be friendly. And a terrible precedent in those ways. So if we’re going to do permitting reform, we should rationally do it in order to speed up the thing we need more of and not to speed up the thing we need less of. So we’ll see what happens down the road. But that was as obnoxious an attempt as it’s almost possible to imagine.

ezra klein

So I knew a bunch of climate hawk people in the Senate who were supporting that bill. People like Ron Wyden, the Finance Chair. He’s been a leader on a bunch of these issues. Brian Schatz from Hawaii. One of the points they made about it to me and to others is that when you looked at the set of projects that would have a little bit of a faster path through review and possibly to construction — again, putting aside the, as you say, quite obnoxious carve-out for the Mountain Valley pipeline — because so much more clean energy is being built right now than fossil fuel infrastructure, it would, on net, have been more of an accelerant on the clean energy side. I think there was something like 30 projects that would have gotten a boost in this. And 25 of them — or maybe it’s 31 projects, actually — and 25 of them were clean energy or transmission lines. And then another five or six were fossil fuel. And so their argument for it was that net net there is so much more clean energy to be constructed that speeding up the path does more for clean energy by a lot than it does for fossil fuels. How do you think about that argument?

bill mckibben

I think it’s probably unlikely. There are some specific examples, and transmission lines are the best one, that do require that kind of federal permitting and things to go quickly. And so it would be helpful there. But most of the opposition and most of the permits and stuff for clean energy things, because they’re inherently smaller in scale and more localized, thank heaven, are at the state and local level. And that’s where most of these battles are going to be fought. So I think the impact of it would have been not overwhelming on clean energy and would have, as again, locked in these big fossil fuel projects. So I understand completely why people in those communities were opposed to it. And their arguments seem to me powerful. If you build something like the Mountain Valley pipeline, it has the same or more obnoxious effects on your local situation as building a transmission line or whatever else. But it also has this massive effect on the planet. And so those things combined to make people really opposed to it. I hope that we can figure out, as I said, how to speed up clean energy rollout in every way. I don’t think that the permitting reforms there are going to be the biggest part of that. But it’ll be fine to do some permitting reforms around that if they speed up what we need, instead of what we don’t need. We’re not at a point where we can take any more fossil fuel expansion. The International Energy Agency said last year that the new expansion of any fossil fuel projects had to come to an end then — 2021. That if you wanted to meet the targets that we would set in Paris, there just was no more room for any more oil and gas or coal. And I think they’re right. I think that the physics of this is pretty clear.

ezra klein

One thing that I’ve been surprised by, maybe a little bit disappointed by, is I can certainly see the case for opposing the Manchin permitting reforms. But you really do, among many, many other things you need, need permitting reforms, an idea of how to speed up permitting and how to give clean energy a faster pathway to construction if you’re going to get this bill done at the speed it needs to get done at. And I’ve really not seen the climate movement or the clean energy movement come out and say, this is what we want. This is what the bill we would agree to looks like. I’m curious if you have ideas of what a bill like that should look like.

bill mckibben

I don’t have any specific ideas about that bill. But I think it’s a fair critique. I was sitting down a couple of weeks ago with some of the people who are opposing a particular lithium mine up on a pass in Nevada because it’s a sacred site for the Indigenous community, which fair enough. I mean, these are people whose sacred sites have not been respected in any way for several hundred years. But I said to them, I think it would help this effort a lot if we could also work to identify the sites where we should mine lithium. It’s not the job of the local tribe to do that. But it is the job of the environmental groups that are working with them to block that mine to suggest instead where else we can find it. And happily, it turns out there are a dozen other places in Nevada alone where there’s lithium to be found. And happily, it turns out that we’re figuring out how to use the brine from the Salton Sea to concentrate lithium and produce it, and on and on and on. The technological learning curve helps a lot with this technology because we get better at it and it gets more efficient. But yeah, suggesting what we do instead is a reasonable question, I think, for environmentalists, a reasonable question for everyone. One of the ideas that’s, I think, really wrong here is the idea that environmentalism represents some special interest that needs to answer all the time for everything. Environmental — I mean, most of us — me, for instance — are all just volunteers in this work, and we do it because we care about the planet we live on. And it’s not a special interest in that way. It should be everybody’s interest. And everybody should be engaged in that work.

ezra klein

I fully agree with that. And one particular reason I find these trade-offs interesting — I’ve not figured out how to actually say this next part. I’m not sure if what I want to say is that the tensions facing the environmental movement are the same as the ones facing everyone, or if the climate movement has been so successful that basically, not literally everyone, but a huge swath of the governance and business and cultural worlds are now actually part of the climate movement. The decisions Gavin Newsom has to make. The decisions Gretchen Whitmer will have to make as governor who just won reelection for governor in Michigan. The decisions basically anybody running anything, including Republicans running cities and counties and states where there are going to be solar companies trying to take advantage of new tax credits and figuring out where to place their solar arrays. I mean, Texas produces quite a lot of renewable energy. And so there’s this way in which you see a kind of sharp set of questions here that environmentalists have to answer. And I think it’s important that they do because they are leaders in coming up with the ideas that then end up, to some degree or another, getting adopted across society. But I really want to affirm what you say, that this is not some special set of problems for the environmental community. They’re just going to be grappling with them first. And if they’re not well-grappled with, we will do them badly. Because this stuff is going to have to go somewhere. But that also brings up another thing that has been on my mind is the tension — and here, again, a tension within the community and then a tension more broadly — which is there’s an interesting fight that I’m not sure people always recognize is happening between those who want to solve climate change — or slow climate change is probably the more accurate way to put it — using only the energy sources that get called renewable — wind and solar and some other smaller things like that — versus what sometimes gets called the “all of the above” strategy, which includes nuclear, and geothermal, and natural gas with carbon capture sequestration systems. And this is a kind of tough fight in California where I live. There has been this very, very big nuclear plant called Diablo Canyon, and they had made a decision some number of years ago to begin shutting it down. But it provides about of our clean electricity, and we have very, very, very aggressive, ambitious clean energy goals. And shutting it down when it’s operating fairly safely was a little bit of a crazy thing. And now it looks like they might be extending its life. But it’s been a very big fight here. And part of that fight goes to a discomfort with things like nuclear. But at the same time, if we need to move so fast, maybe you need to have them or even have more of them. Can you talk a little bit about that tension and how you’ve started to think about it?

bill mckibben

Sure. What I’ve been saying for some years now is that where we have nuclear power plants that can be operated safely, we should probably keep them open. And I don’t think that’s a rare position on the environmental movement. In fact, Greta Thunberg said the same thing a few weeks ago. And I think people are, for the most part, supportive of more money for research into doing things like small modular reactors or even fusion or things. My sense is that some, anyway, of the environmental opposition to nuclear power has waned over the years, although it hasn’t helped any to watch tank battles going on in the parking lots of nuclear reactors in Ukraine. A reminder that this is technology with real risks. At the moment, though, the biggest risk from nuclear power is the fact that it just costs a crazy amount of money to do it. And so if we decide we’re going to build it instead of renewable energy, the opportunity cost in terms of cash is really large. And there are utilities trying to make that decision because they like the degree of control they have over centralized energy systems. So in North Carolina, for instance, the current plan for getting to net zero for the utility involves waiting until the 2030s when they hope that there will be working small modular reactors that are cost-effective. We don’t know if those will exist. We don’t know what they will cost. And we certainly shouldn’t be waiting in order to see. We should be deploying the stuff that we have now. But in general, I think people are eager to see what research and innovation can give us as we go down the road. And if geothermal power or tidal power or things prove out, then I think lots and lots of people will be enthusiastic about it. There are other things that fall deeply into the category of false solutions and natural gas plants with carbon capture equipment are the perfect example. Look, it’s already cheaper to produce electricity from renewable sources than from burning gas. And when you add on the cost of a giant chemistry project to the top of the natural gas plant so that you can capture the CO2 from its smoke stream and pump it underground, that cost gets enormous. And that’s why they’re demanding that taxpayers bear that cost. It’s a silly indulgence, the only point of which is to allow the utility and the fossil fuel industry can continue with their business model of setting stuff on fire. So as always, the devil is in the details here. But I do think that people that I know in the environmental movement are open to the possibilities of ongoing technological innovation. They just don’t want it delayed while we have a tool at hand right now that’s affordable and effective.

ezra klein

Let me try to offer the other side of that. So I had Jesse Jenkins from Princeton on the show recently and we were talking about carbon capture or sequestration issues and particularly around natural gas. And the way I understand the role it plays in the modeling that his and other teams have done is nobody really wants that as a permanent solution. It’s not how you want to be powering energy 50 years from now. But particularly in a world where the buildout to get to the numbers we want to hit has to happen at a rate that is implausible, given everything we’ve seen in our country, and, frankly, other countries, do in recent years, that it acts as not so much a false or real solution, as a kind of hedge, as a way of buying time. If you can keep things that are currently operating, operating at a low carbon output, much lower than they otherwise would be, then that maybe gives you a couple more years to do the buildout of these other energy solutions. And so in a world where we hope we can do it that fast, but I think that’s a real place where one should reasonably have skepticism, that they end up playing an important bridge role.

bill mckibben

Well, my guess is that it’s a time and money suck that will slow things down. But in the case of natural gas, the other problem — and this is a place that has been particularly problematic for Democrats over the years on energy — natural gas was always the solution that Democrats liked. It was a way to appease the fossil fuel industry and still reduce carbon emissions because natural gas produces about half as much carbon when you burn it as coal does to produce the same number of B.T.U.s. The problem is, as always, that physics doesn’t care about any of this. And it turned out that in the course of doing natural gas, we were producing huge amounts of methane into the atmosphere. Methane is a more potent heat-trapping gas than CO2 and its concentration is rising more quickly at the moment. So natural gas that Democrats preferred to fossil fuel, turns out it’s not really the other white meat. I don’t know quite what the right metaphor is here. But it’s not helpful. Getting off the practice of burning things is our job. And telling that story, since we’ve been talking a lot about storytelling, is I think important here. If we don’t tell that story right, we’re going to go in exactly the opposite direction. So I think our job, as I say, is to tell the story of a rapid transition from setting stuff on fire here to using the fire that’s up in the sky. And that’s a powerful story, a powerful narrative that makes a lot of sense.

ezra klein

I want to close here by looking forward to the next couple of years. I think that the animating goal of the climate movement, and also just people who are in politics who care about climate, has been getting big legislation passed. And maybe the Inflation Reduction Act combined with the Bipartisan Infrastructure bill and CHIPS, it’s not as big as some of us would have hoped, but it is profound. And it’s coming in a context where other countries are passing legislation and coming in a context where the cultural movement towards seeing climate as a problem, the number of smart young people going into climate tech, the number of businesses — some of them are just greenwashing, but some of them take it more seriously — who are trying to align themselves on the right side of this issue is much higher. I think it can sometimes seem to people that the questions of politics are all can you get the president elected that you want and then can you pass a bill. But there’s this whole space, as you’ve mentioned before, of implementation and deployment. So if you are a person listening to this, and we don’t know, maybe Kevin McCarthy will be the next Speaker or maybe not. It’s still a little bit uncertain. But we’re not going to have very big climate legislation in the next two years. What is your role? What could you do to help this move forward? If you have cared about doing this, what is next now that the bills are signed and the era of deployment and implementation has begun?

bill mckibben

I think you’re right in your analysis about what’s going to happen in Congress going forward — not much. I think that if you care about making things happen fast, one, try and persuade the president to use his executive action in as many places as he can. Two, work hard on state and local governments to get them to move more quickly. State public utility commissions are a really good place to start because almost nobody pays any attention to them and they wield enormous power. And it’s a place where a little bit of attention goes a long way. Three, step back from the political realm for a minute and look for the other large lever here, the other lever big enough to matter. That one’s not marked politics. It’s marked money or finance. Pressure on the big banks, and on the big asset managers, and on the insurance companies to stop financing fossil fuel expansion remains a crucial, crucial tactic in helping us make this change at the speed that we need to make. So those are the places I would concentrate. Executive action, state and local action, pressure on the financial world.

ezra klein

One person is one person. You’ve been involved in the climate movement, particularly 350.org. There are other groups out there like Sunrise. If people want to join something, so they’re part of a community that is engaging in collective action, what do you suggest to them?

bill mckibben

Let me say, I think it’s just the right impulse. The most important thing an — I mean, look, I’m happy that I’ve got solar panels all over my roof, but I don’t try to fool myself that that’s mostly how we’re going to do this. We can’t make the math work one Tesla at a time. The most important thing an individual can do is be a little less of an individual and join together with others in movements large enough to make big changes in the basic political or economic ground rules. So if you’re under 30, the Sunrise Movement is a great place to start. If you’re over 60, join us at Third Act. I think we’re beginning to do really interesting work in bringing that generation huge and politically powerful into line here to help. If you’re in between, there’s lots and lots of places that are in groups and movements that are doing all kinds of good work. Look around your local community, your local chapter of the Sierra Club or whatever it is, it’s probably engaged in all kinds of interesting fights. But yeah, the two technologies that came out of the 20th century that may still save us — one technology is the solar panel and the other technology is the big nonviolent social movement. It was invented by people on the margins — Gandhi, Dr. King, the suffragettes, a million other people whose names we don’t know. And it’s the way that the small and the many can stand up to the mighty and the few. You have to build those movements because otherwise vested interest and inertia will keep us from moving at the pace that we need to move.

ezra klein

So something that movements have to do, that people have to do to remain influential is to change as the world changes. And so I want to close here, before going to books, by asking you about the ways you’ve changed. I’ve heard you talk about an old fight in Vermont around closing a nuclear plant that you cheered on and feeling that if that fight came up today, you’d actually be on the other side of it. Tell me about how your sense of what is needed here has shifted as the structure of the problem has shifted.

bill mckibben

Sure. And as technology changes and things, you get different options and different possibilities. Truthfully, I think I’d probably err on the side of letting that, say, the nuclear power plant in Vermont stay open, in part because in its wake, Vermonters did not rally to make sure that we could replace it with solar power and wind power. Just the opposite, the state has had a de facto moratorium on wind turbine development in all the years since. And that’s not OK, because it means that the burden falls on someone else, someone’s mountain who’s getting ripped apart for mountaintop coal mining, or, as always, somebody in the rest of the world who’s having to deal with the carbon that we’re producing in this part of the world. So yeah, as with all things, new — what is it Lowell said? “New occasions teach new duties. Time makes ancient good uncouth. They must upward still, and onward, who would keep abreast of truth.” But the North Star for me hasn’t changed. Our job is to respond to the demands of physics. That’s what makes this different from other political fights. And it’s one of the reasons that it’s hard sometimes, I think, for politicians to completely understand it. Because the normal course of political life involves lots of compromise. That’s probably how it should be. You think that having a minimum wage is an absurd liberal affectation. I think the minimum wage should be $30 an hour because that’s what it really takes to raise a family. We meet in the middle at $15 and come back to fight it out again in a few more years and whatever. That’s how change necessarily works in a human society. But in this case, the basic frame of the problem is not between different human communities. Yes, there are battles between Republicans and Democrats, industry and environmentalists, the global South and the global North. But the basic fight is between human beings and physics. And that’s not a fight we’re going to win. Physics is immature. It doesn’t compromise. And so we need to respect its limits, especially those of us who produce in our course of our lives and in the places where we live, lots and lots and lots of the carbon that’s heating up the planet.

ezra klein

Bill, thank you so much for the time today. It’s such a pleasure. And I know you’re coming to us from Egypt and at an odd time for you. But always our final question — what are three books that have influenced you, you would recommend to the audience?

Well, three recent ones — you’ve talked a good deal with my dear friend Kim Stanley Robinson and about his book “Ministry for the Future,” which is wonderful. But because I love New York City so much, my favorite of his books and my favorite novel about climate change is a book called “New York 2140,” which couldn’t be more fun and in a certain odd way more cheerful. Speaking of cheerful, the best writer about realistic hope, it seems to me, at the moment is Rebecca Solnit. And her most recent book was about one of my greatest literary heroes, George Orwell. But it’s called “Orwell’s Roses,” and it was about his relationship with the natural world. And it’s a beautiful, beautiful book. And good news for all of us, Wendell Berry has a brand new set of short stories tracing his community, “The Port William Membership,” just out. It came out on Election Day. And I think the title is “How it Went.” So those are mine right now.

The three people familiar with the matter asked not to be identified in order to discuss internal deliberations.

Abdullah Hasan, a White House spokesman, said that final decisions about the monument designation had not been made.

The area in question is already off limits to uranium mining, a designation made by President Barack Obama in 2011. But those protections are set to expire in 2032. If Mr. Biden were to designate the land as a national monument, those conditions would be permanent. The expected announcement was first reported by The Washington Post."

In short, the present.

Ten thousand years after our species began forming primitive agrarian societies, a panel of scientists on Saturday took a big step toward declaring a new interval of geologic time: the Anthropocene, the age of humans.

Our current geologic epoch, the Holocene, began 11,700 years ago with the end of the last big ice age. The panel’s roughly three dozen scholars appear close to recommending that, actually, we have spent the past few decades in a brand-new time unit, one characterized by human-induced, planetary-scale changes that are unfinished but very much underway.

“If you were around in 1920, your attitude would have been, ‘Nature’s too big for humans to influence,’” said Colin N. Waters, a geologist and chair of the Anthropocene Working Group, the panel that has been deliberating on the issue since 2009. The past century has upended that thinking, Dr. Waters said. “It’s been a shock event, a bit like an asteroid hitting the planet.”"

But when so much of the life that existed along the river was erased long ago by concrete, how do you make the invisible visible? Part of the answer involves studying organisms that died within the past 60,000 years or so."

The less-pithy definition is “a 24-hour period in which the central pressure falls by at least 24 millibars,” which is a measure of atmospheric pressure.

In the term’s early days, the weather pattern “was primarily an ocean phenomenon,” Dr. Gyakum said, and it still largely is. Perhaps more people are affected these days because the coasts are more densely populated. “Why do we hear more about bomb cyclones than we did 40 years ago?” he said. “People are paying more attention to extreme weather than in the olden days.” He added, “Talking about bomb cyclones is not necessarily an indication of increased frequency.”

According to Google Trends, the phrase “bomb cyclone” was barely uttered until 2017 but has since has risen to a din, along with “weather bomb” and “weather cyclone bomb.”

Some meteorologists said they had become cautious about what they uttered, to avoid sensationalism. “Once you use a term and let the cat out of the bag, you can’t get it back in,” said Andrew Hoell, a research meteorologist with NOAA, where he is co-leader of the drought task force. “It can be used in ways you never imagined.”

He had just finished speaking at the “Explaining Extreme Events Press Conference,” which was fairly dry, linguistically. Afterward, Dr. Hoell was more emphatic about what he won’t say: “I don’t use ‘megadrought.’” Nevertheless, later in the conference he was scheduled to participate in a town-hall discussion titled, “Drought, Megadrought, or a Permanent Change? A Shifting Paradigm for Drought in the Western United States.”"

As human activity continues to heat the planet, warmer air holds more moisture. That means storms that blow through California most winters, known as atmospheric rivers for their long shape and the huge amounts of water they carry, are more likely to be extremely intense.

Atmospheric rivers that come in a rapid-fire procession, like those in California since late December, can be particularly dangerous. Land and streams already saturated from one downpour simply can’t accommodate water from the next one, which amplifies the potential for flooding and landslides. The most catastrophic flooding in modern California history took place in the winter of 1861, when successive weeks of powerful storms caused epochal deluges across the West Coast. Climate scientists now say the risks of storm sequences of similar intensity are rising as Earth warms."

You told me that trees are the best and the only thing we have right now to fight climate change cheaply and do it fast. But there’s only so much arable land, and trees are said to provide only half of the removal needed. Do you agree that there’s not enough land to plant the trees we need?

No, I don’t agree with that. In the United States, you had the terrible dust storms of the 1930s, and we’re actually returning to this. And you had a president called Roosevelt, and Roosevelt was very smart. He got a huge group of people out planting a gleditsia species. They’re a honey locust. They’re the inermis species of honey locust. And there’s all kinds of research done around those honey locusts. It stopped the storms from destroying the farming land, and they were planted all over the United States. So a lot of them are gone now. And let me say to you: There are trees that can grow on almost nothing. We need those trees. Some trees are feeding trees. Some trees produce all kinds of nuts and all kinds of other things that the farming community can get the benefit from.

Too many trees, too many forests all over the world have come down too much. When we were taking down these forests, we did not know that they were molecular machines. And they are intelligent machines that are capable of farming the photons of the sun.

Is there enough to draw down the carbon, though? It’s been said we don’t have enough land to plant enough trees to draw down the carbon.

We have 412, something like that, parts per million CO2 in the atmosphere right now. So if you plant, every person — this is my global bio plan for saving the planet — one tree, native species to native area, for the next six years, you will have in the ballpark of 50 billion trees put back into the planet. You will pull the CO2 event down from the 410 backwards into the three hundreds. You can stabilize that in the 300s and it reduces the temperature, it reduces the greenhouse effect. It gives us time to re-regulate the carbon cycle. That’s what it will do for us. And it’s a very simple thing. It’s very cheap. You can go out and get an acorn. If you really feel that you’ve got a terribly bad back and you can’t possibly use a shovel, then go and get a trowel, get an acorn, and get your kid to plant an acorn. So it’s a very simple thing to do."

That was only partly offset by a rise in coal use, as countries like Germany and Austria restarted long-dormant coal-fired power plants to ease their energy shortfalls.

By contrast, in the United States, emissions are projected to rise around 1.5 percent this year, driven by a surge in natural gas use as the economy picked up. Emissions from oil are also up as air travel recovers from pandemic lows.

In India, fossil fuel emissions are expected to increase by nearly 6 percent, the largest single driver of the growth in carbon dioxide globally. India recently surpassed the European Union as the world’s third-largest emitter, although its per person emissions are just one-third those of Europe.

In the rest of the world, fossil fuel emissions increased by roughly 1.7 percent this year. Emissions from coal are likely to hit record highs, in part because many countries are shifting over to the highly polluting fuel in response to soaring natural gas prices.

One big question is whether fossil fuel emissions will continue to increase in the years ahead.

A recent report by the International Energy Agency, a leading forecaster, predicted that global fossil fuel demand was likely to peak and then level off sometime this decade. One major reason is that many governments have responded to the war in Ukraine by enacting stronger policies to shift away from oil, gas and coal. In the United States, for instance, Congress approved $370 billion in spending for wind turbines, solar panels, nuclear power plants, hydrogen fuels, electric vehicles and electric heat pumps."

For years, we had been looking for the right moment to start such a project. Scientists are eager to engage with the public, and every reader’s observations contribute to a greater understanding in some area of research. We wanted an activity that would help readers see the effects of climate change in their neighborhoods, and we wanted readers’ contributions to feed into a collective effort that could bring people together, albeit virtually.

Birds seemed like the right subject for engagement. They exist almost everywhere. They’re dinosaurs with feathers. They’re pollinators, pest controllers and transporters of seeds. They connect distant ecosystems, and they connect the birders who observe them. Many species are threatened by climate change, pollution and habitat loss."

More than eight months into Russia’s war on Ukraine, Europe is holding firm on maintaining support for Ukraine and tough sanctions on Russia — even amid an escalating cost-of-living crisis that has precipitated strikes, protests and gloom. Most of those pushing for immediate peace or a re-embrace of Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, are for now sequestered in the political opposition.

In France, for instance, many people have accepted the depiction of the war by Emmanuel Macron, their president, as an existential battle that threatens peace and democracy. Some also worry that Russia’s targets will expand, bringing the war closer to their own doorsteps. It has helped that the French government, like Germany’s, has spent massively to blunt some of the effects of inflation and higher energy prices.

Analysts believe that commitment to Ukraine will last as long as the U.S. holds the line. Gains in today’s midterm elections by Republicans, some of whom have questioned the cost of the war, could alter those expectations. And doubts over whether that resolve can endure through a tough winter and beyond continue to linger, as Europeans face new security threats and economic uncertainty."

It is separated from an eight-story structure named for the entertainment mogul David Geffen by a circle of grass, trees and benches embedded in a plaza. The ensemble joins a sleek new campus that so far includes a neuroscience research center, an arts center, and a think-tank-style building, called The Forum, devoted to academic discourse.

But the real story of the business buildings lies within. Appearing wraithlike behind the glass, stairways in both wind over and around themselves like crinkly strands of DNA as they ascend full height. These are what the architects, Diller Scofidio + Renfro, working with the FxCollaborative architecture firm, call “network” stairs. Twisting through ceiling surfaces curved and warped to accommodate them, they beg to be used.

The Consequences of Elon Musk’s Ownership of X

Now rebranded as X, the site has experienced a surge in racist, antisemitic and other hateful speech. Under Mr. Musk’s watch, millions of people have been exposed to misinformation about climate change. Foreign governments and operatives — from Russia to China to Hamas — have spread divisive propaganda with little or no interference.

Mr. Musk and his team have repeatedly asserted that such concerns are overblown, sometimes pushing back aggressively against people who voice them. Yet dozens of studies from multiple organizations have shown otherwise, demonstrating on issue after issue a similar trend: an increase in harmful content on X during Mr. Musk’s tenure.

The war between Israel and Hamas — the sort of major news event that once made Twitter an essential source of information and debate — has drowned all social media platforms in false and misleading information, but for Mr. Musk’s platform in particular the war has been seen as a watershed. The conflict has captured in full how much the platform has descended into the kind of site that Mr. Musk had promised advertisers he wanted to avoid on the day he officially took over.

“With disinformation about the Israel-Hamas conflict flourishing so dramatically on X, it feels that it crossed a line for a lot of people where they can see — beyond just the branding change — that the old Twitter is truly gone,” Tim Chambers of Dewey Square Group, a public affairs company that tracks social media, said in an interview. “And the new X is a shadow of that former self.”

The growing sense of chaos on the platform has already hurt Mr. Musk’s investment. While it remains one of the most popular social media services, people visited the website nearly 5.9 billion times in September, down 14 percent from the same month last year, according to the data analysis firm Similarweb.

Advertisers have also fled, leading to a sizable slump in sales. Mr. Musk noted this summer that ad revenue had fallen 50 percent. He blamed the Anti-Defamation League, one of several advocacy groups that have cataloged the rise of hateful speech on X, for “trying to kill this platform.”

Most of the problems, however, stem from changes that Mr. Musk instituted – some intentionally, some not. Studies about the state of X have been conducted over the past year by researchers and analysts at universities, think tanks and advocacy organizations concerned with the spread of hate speech and other harmful content.

Research conducted in part by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue concluded that anti-Semitic tweets in English more than doubled after Mr. Musk’s takeover. A report from the European Commission found that engagement with pro-Kremlin accounts grew 36 percent on the platform in the first half of this year after Mr. Musk lifted mitigation measures.

Mr. Musk disbanded an advisory council focused on trust and safety issues and laid off scores of employees who addressed them. For a monthly fee, he offered users a blue checkmark, a label that once conveyed that Twitter had verified the identity of the user behind an account. He then used algorithms to promote accounts of uncertain provenance in users’ feeds. He removed labels that identified government and state media accounts for countries like Russia and China that censor independent media.

“The entire year’s worth of changes to X were fully stress tested during the global news breaking last week,” Mr. Chambers said, referring to the conflict in Israel. “And in the eyes of many, myself included, it failed utterly.”

The company did not respond to a request for comment beyond a stock response it regularly uses to press inquiries: “Busy now, please check back later.”

X trails only Facebook’s 16.3 billion monthly visits and Instagram’s 6.4 billion visits, according to Similarweb. TikTok, which is rising in popularity among certain demographic groups, has roughly two billion visits each month. Despite voluble threats by disgruntled users to move to alternative platforms – Mastodon, BlueSky or Meta’s new rival to Mr. Musk’s, Threads – none of them have yet reached the critical mass to replicate the public exposure that X offers.

Keeping X at the center of public debate is exactly Mr. Musk’s goal, which he describes at times with a messianic zeal. The day after Hamas attacked Israel, Mr. Musk urged his followers to follow “the war in real time.”

He then cited two accounts that are notorious for spreading disinformation, including a false post in the spring that an explosion had occurred outside the Pentagon. Faced with a flurry of criticism, Mr. Musk deleted the post and later sounded chastened.

He urged his followers on X to “stay as close to the truth as possible, even for stuff you don’t like. This platform aspires to maximize signal/noise of the human collective.”

Mr. Musk, the prominent, outspoken executive behind Tesla and Space X, had been an avid Twitter user for years before taking it over, promoting his ventures and himself, at times with crude, offensive comments. During the Covid-19 pandemic, he sharply criticized lockdowns and other measures to slow the virus’s spread and began to warn of a “woke” culture that silenced dissent.

Among his first acts as the site’s owner was to reverse the bans on thousands of accounts, including those of users who had promoted the QAnon conspiracy theory and spread disinformation about Covid and the 2020 presidential election.

The impact was instantaneous. Researchers at Tufts, Rutgers and Montclair State universities documented spikes in the use of racial and ethnic slurs soon after Mr. Musk’s acquisition. One research institute found that a campaign on 4chan, a notorious bulletin board, encouraged the use of a particular slur within hours of his arrival, in what seemed to be a coordinated test of the new owner’s tolerance for offensive speech.

The prevalence of such offensive language has, according to numerous studies, continued unabated. “The Musk acquisition saw a sustained rise in hateful speech on the platform,” an article in The Misinformation Review, a peer-reviewed journal published by the Harvard Kennedy School, said in August.

Even worse, the article argued, Mr. Musk’s changes appear to be boosting the engagements of the most contentious users.

A month into Mr. Musk’s ownership, the platform stopped enforcing its policy against Covid-19 misinformation. The liberal watchdog group Media Matters later identified 250 accounts with high engagement on Covid-related tweets. Nine of the top 10 accounts were known anti-vaccine proponents, several of whom promoted unproven and potentially harmful treatments and attacked top public health officials.

Mr. Musk’s first summer as X’s boss also coincided with a rash of climate-related disasters around the world, including deadly heat waves, rampaging wildfires, torrential rains and intense flooding. Last month, a scorecard evaluating social media companies on their defenses against climate-related falsehoods awarded X a single point out of a possible 21 (Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, was given eight points).

The platform was “lacking clear policies that address climate misinformation, having no substantive public transparency mechanisms, and offering no evidence of effective policy enforcement,” said the accompanying report from Climate Action Against Disinformation, an international coalition of more than 50 environmental advocacy groups.

This year, hundreds of researchers pushed back against a decision by X to end free access to software that would allow them collect and analyze data about the site.

Perhaps the most impactful change under Mr. Musk has been the evolution of his subscription plans. The blue checkmark that once conveyed veracity and denoted verified accounts, often those of government agencies, companies and prominent users, was now available to any account for $8 a month.

In April, Mr. Musk began removing the blue badges from verified accounts. New ones impersonating public officials, government agencies and celebrities proliferated, causing confusion about which were real. The platform went on to reward those who paid for their blue labels by amplifying their posts over those without the badge.

Reset, a nonprofit research organization, discovered that dozens of anonymous accounts linked to the Kremlin received the checkmark, pushing Russian narratives on the war in Ukraine. This spring, the platform also removed the labels that identified official state media of countries like Russia, China and Iran. In the 90 days after the change, engagement with posts from the English-language accounts of those outlets soared 70 percent, NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, reported in September.

Mr. Musk has now run afoul of the European Union’s newly enacted Digital Services Act, a law that requires social media platforms to restrict misinformation and other violative content within the union’s 27 nations.

A report commissioned by the union’s executive body warned in August that Mr. Musk’s dismantling of guardrails on the platform had resulted in a 36 percent increase in engagement with Kremlin-linked accounts from January through May, mostly pushing Russia’s justifications for its illegal invasion of Ukraine last year.

After war erupted between Israel and Hamas, Thierry Breton, a European Commissioner who oversees the law’s implementation, warned Mr. Musk in a letter that was posted on X, saying the company needed to address “violent and terrorist content that appears to circulate on your platform.”

Reset, the research organization, reported recently that it had documented 166 posts that its researchers considered antisemitic. Many appeared to violate laws in several European countries, including calls for violence against Jews and denying the historical facts of the Holocaust. They accumulated at least 23 million views and 480,000 engagements.

Mr. Musk sounded incredulous, even as the company scrambled to delete accounts linked to Hamas and other terrorist groups. He responded two days later to an account identified by the Anti-Defamation League as one of the most prominent purveyors of disinformation. The account, which had been removed from Twitter but was restored last December after Mr. Musk took over, had claimed that the European Union was trying to police the truth.

Such plants are using generous subsidies from Mr. Biden’s signature legislative achievements — especially the climate change provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act — as the administration pushes to speed the country’s transition to electric vehicles.

“This historic contract is a testament to the power of unions and collective bargaining to build strong middle-class jobs while helping our most iconic American companies thrive,” Mr. Biden said Monday evening.

Jason Walsh, the executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance, which has brought together labor and environmental groups to marshal support for the clean energy transition, said the contracts, if ratified by U.A.W. workers, would be a watershed moment for the economy — and possibly the planet.

“The legislative intent behind the industrial policy in the Inflation Reduction Act was an implicit deal: We as a nation are going to invest in the sectors of the economy that are important to the country and the planet in the long run, but in return we want the companies that receive those benefits to maximize returns to workers, communities and the environment,” Mr. Walsh said. To that end, the contract settlement is “huge,” he added. “It highlights the lie peddled by Donald Trump and at times the Big Three that the E.V. transition means lower-quality jobs in a nonunion work force.”

The U.A.W. actions took on strikingly political meaning. In May, the autoworkers’ union opted to withhold an endorsement of Mr. Biden’s re-election, openly expressing “our concerns with the electric vehicle transition” that the president was pushing through legislation and regulation."

As climate protesters across Europe stepped up their attacks against art, Wipplinger took measures to protect his storied collection, which includes famous paintings by Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele. Bags were banned; coats, too. The museum hired extra guards to patrol its five floors.

It didn’t work. Last week, members of a group called Last Generation walked into the museum and threw black liquid at one of Klimt’s major works, “Death and Life.” A protester had sneaked the liquid into the museum in a hot water bottle strapped to his chest, Wipplinger said.

The Klimt, protected by glass, was unharmed. But Wipplinger said his security team could only have stopped the attack by subjecting visitors to invasive body searches, “like at the airport.” He didn’t want to even consider that prospect, he added.

“If we start such procedures, the whole idea of what a museum is dies,” Wipplinger said. “A museum is a place that should always be open to the public,” adding: “We can’t stop being that.”"

Professor Savoie said that the clerk and the prime minister meet several times each week and that each brings a separate agenda.

But it’s not the worst air quality that the United States has seen. There have been about 40 times over the past decade when the index has risen above 500, into what the E.P.A. calls “Beyond the A.Q.I.” Most of those instances have occurred in Western states, including California, Oregon and Washington, the E.P.A. said in an email, as wildfires spread a blanket of smoke over parts of the region.

The E.P.A. in 1999 released the current version of the six-tier index as a way to communicate to the public the density of five pollutants. A rating anywhere between 301 and 500 is considered “hazardous,” and air quality at that level will trigger health warnings. At that level and beyond, everyone should stay indoors and reduce activity levels. “Use the same information that is for the ‘hazardous’ category,” the E.P.A. advises.

Debs-style socialist manifesto.

The Whitney leaves that one out, though it proudly presents other facial substitution videos which depict George W. Bush and his cabinet as teary, apologetic war criminals.

Tesla, for example, faces serious competition in the market for electric vehicles, even as the Twitter escapades of its proprietor, Elon Musk, may be turning off some would-be car buyers. Meta reported a continuing decline in sales and earnings on Wednesday, though its stock soared on plans for further share buybacks, amid a broad stock market rally fueled by hopes that the Federal Reserve’s interest rate increases were abating. Still, the scale of its unprofitable investments in virtual reality have worried many investors. Netflix, which once said it competed only with sleep for the attention of its subscribers, now jousts with a horde of streaming companies.

But, in broad terms, two real-world factors are responsible for their reclassification this year. First, while the initial, lockdown phase of the Covid-19 pandemic generally increased tech firms’ sales and profits in 2020 and 2021, it set them up for a sharp decline in their growth rates in 2022 as the economy recovered.

Second, soaring inflation and rising interest rates — the Fed raised short-term rates again on Wednesday — hurt the tech companies, too. Why? Basically because tech companies that entice investors with the mere promise of future sales and profits are worth less when the costs of waiting for those promises rise.

In short, the abrupt reversal of the eight big tech companies’ momentum last year changed their profiles, according to the S&P Indices algorithms. Now, the S&P 500 Pure Growth Index includes just one: Apple. Despite periodic setbacks like the decline in sales and earnings it announced on Thursday, it has for the most part kept growing.

How are the others classified? The answer isn’t simple. Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft now reside in both of the two, more inclusive, S&P 500 growth and value indexes: subsets of the S&P 500 that welcome stocks near the middle of the growth-value spectrum. Netflix, Nvidia and Tesla are only in the broad growth index, implying that they have retained more growth characteristics than Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft."

From those task forces came what Barack Obama called “the most progressive platform of any major-party nominee in history.” And that progressivism continued into Mr. Biden’s presidency. One hundred days after he took office, The New York Times concluded that he had “moved leftward with his party, and early in his tenure is driving the biggest expansion of American government in decades.”

By challenging him from the left, Mr. Sanders didn’t only change Mr. Biden’s candidacy. He also made him a better president. But only on domestic policy. There was no joint working group specifically devoted to foreign affairs — and it shows. With rare exceptions, Mr. Biden hasn’t challenged the hawkish conventional wisdom that permeates Washington; he’s embodied it. He’s largely ignored progressives, who, polls suggest, want a fundamentally different approach to the world. And he’ll keep ignoring them until a challenger turns progressive discontent into votes.

Take China. America’s new cold war against Beijing may enjoy bipartisan support in Washington, but it doesn’t enjoy bipartisan support in the United States. According to an April Pew Research Center poll, only 27 percent of Democrats see China as an enemy — roughly half the figure among Republicans. In a December 2021 Chicago Council survey, two-thirds of Republicans — but less than four in 10 Democrats — described limiting China’s global influence as a very important foreign policy goal."

The Environmental Protection Agency rule, which was finalized on Friday, essentially reverts protections for millions of streams, marshes and other bodies of water to levels that existed before the Obama administration made major changes in 2015, leading to nearly a decade of political and legal disputes.

With the Supreme Court expected to rule next year in a major case that could reduce the government’s authority to regulate wetlands, experts called the Biden administration’s move strategic. Getting a rule on the books now gives the E.P.A. a greater chance of locking in, at least for a while, a broad definition of which waterways qualify for federal protection under the Clean Water Act.

“If the Supreme Court goes first, then the agency can’t finalize a rule that goes beyond it,” said Kevin S. Minoli, a partner at Alston & Bird who served as an E.P.A. counsel in the Clinton, Bush, Obama and Trump administrations. By issuing a rule first, he said, the government has “more room to interpret” the court decision when it comes."

At a ceremony in Abuja on Tuesday, the German official, Annalena Baerbock, handed the stolen items back to Nigerian officials. “It was wrong to take the bronzes, and it was wrong to keep them for 120 years,” she said.

In a legal sense, the 20 artifacts Baerbock brought with her belonged to Nigeria even before she took off from Berlin; more than 1,100 bronzes in German museums have become Nigerian property since the countries signed an agreement in July. But Tuesday’s handover was an important symbolic gesture, and many more of the artifacts are expected to come back to Nigeria next year. Others will remain in Germany on long-term loan.

The foreign minister’s trip is the culmination of a yearslong process that upended Germany’s approach to handling cultural items unjustly obtained during the colonial period. It is also part of a pioneering model for large-scale restitution, in which ownership is swapped before any artifacts change hands. Crucially, that approach allows for items to be restituted even if the country of origin does not yet have the facilities to store and exhibit them."

But the scarcity of water is also pushing developers to innovate with design and install expensive infrastructure to save fresh water and recycle more wastewater.

A deep drought has settled on the Southwest since 2000, exacerbated by climate change. Water flow has dropped precipitously in the Colorado River and other surface water supplies that serve Arizona and its neighboring states. That is putting more pressure to supply homes and businesses from finite water reserves held in aquifers.

The consequences are being felt across the West. A proposal for a new water pipeline to supply St. George, Utah, has become the focus of public opposition. Communities in Colorado and Utah have declared moratoriums on new developments. And water supply is one reason that rural residents are fighting a proposal to increase the density of homes in Washoe County, Nev.

In Arizona, groundwater levels are falling so fast that thousands of residential wells all over the state are going dry. In 2021, the Arizona Department of Water Resources halted new-home construction in Pinal County, south of Phoenix, because groundwater pumping exceeded the supply.

In New Mexico, two proposals for big planned communities outside Albuquerque have languished because of concerns over water. At one project, Campbell Farming proposed building 4,000 homes, a commercial and retail center and two golf courses on 8,000 acres in the mountains east of the city more than two decades ago, according to planning documents, but it faced objections to groundwater use, which would total about 400 million to 500 million gallons annually. The Office of the State Engineer found that Campbell Ranch would not meet a New Mexico requirement for developers to demonstrate that their projects had a 70-year supply of water."

How Can I Offer You Advice?,” the Times Opinion writer Margaret Renkl adapts a recent baccalaureate address she delivered to the graduating students at the University of the South:

Thirty-nine years ago, my college commencement was held in an un-air-conditioned gymnasium on the hottest day Alabama could serve up. I tried to talk my family into letting me skip the ceremony, but my grandmother, a retired schoolteacher, put her foot down. “We’re going,” she said. So we went. All I remember of the whole day is trying not to perish in the hallucinogenic heat.

My grandmother began her career in a two-room country schoolhouse. She was still teaching 40 years later when Alabama public schools were finally integrated. What my grandmother knew, and I did not, is that it’s right to celebrate a hard-won achievement. It’s right to drink in the pride of family and friends. It’s always right to give yourself over to joy every single time joy is on offer.

It is also right in this liminal moment, this time of looking both before and beyond, to ponder what it all means. What did the years of study and camaraderie really add up to? What new challenges will you be obliged to face in the years to come?

I can’t tell you what it all meant, but I think I understand some of the difficulties that lie ahead.

You are children of the 21st century, and yours is the first generation to recognize the inescapable urgency of climate change, the first not to deny the undeniable loss of biodiversity. You have grown up in an age permeated by the noise of a 24-hour news cycle, by needless political polarization, by devastating gun violence, by the isolating effects of “social” media. You have seen hard-won civil rights rolled back. You have come of age at a time of existential threat — to the planet, to democracy, to the arc of the moral universe itself — and none of it is your fault.

I wouldn’t blame you if you’re wondering how somebody of my generation, which wrecked so much that is precious, could dare to offer you advice. My only response is that age has exactly one advantage over the energy and brilliance of youth: Age teaches a person how to survive despair.

The years have shown me that hardship is only one part of life, and not remotely the largest part. Hardship always lives side by side with happiness. Pain always finds its fullest partner in joy. Love takes many forms, some of them surprising, and people are almost always kinder than we expect."

Ukraine’s minister of internal affairs, Denys Monastyrsky, was among at least 14 people who died yesterday in a helicopter crash. He is the highest-ranking Ukrainian official to die since the beginning of Russia’s invasion last year. An investigation is underway, but there were no initial signs that the aircraft had been shot down.

Monastyrsky’s death deals a blow to a ministry that has played a critical role in the war effort: He oversaw police and emergency services and handled rescue efforts after missile strikes. His top deputy was also killed in the crash, as well as other pivotal figures in Ukraine’s wartime leadership.

The accident comes as the U.S. begins to soften its stance against giving Ukraine the weapons it needs to target Crimea, despite the risk of escalation. Kyiv is looking to strike Russia’s land bridge, a critical supply route that connects Crimea to Russia through the occupied cities of Melitopol and Mariupol.

Davos: In a video address to the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, called for a minute of silence to remember the victims of the crash and then made a passionate speech. “The tyranny is outpacing democracy,” Zelensky said. “The time the free world uses to think is used by the terrorist state to kill.”"

In a televised address last night, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sought to quell the intensifying unrest, suggesting that he would table until late November a broader judicial overhaul plan being undertaken by his government.

The country’s nationalist right celebrated the passage of the law, which has become a stand-in for deeper rifts in Israel between those who want a more secular and pluralist state and those with a more religious and nationalist vision. “With God’s help, this will just be the beginning,” an ultranationalist minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, told reporters.

Response: Yair Lapid, the centrist leader of the opposition, said Netanyahu was in the clutches of the hard-line members of his coalition. “This extremist and messianic government cannot tear our democracy to shreds at noon, and in the evening send Netanyahu to say that he offers negotiations,” he said. “We won’t give up.

Combine that with the kind of MAGA-oriented Republicans who have been winning recent elections — lawmakers who don’t rely on corporate donations and consider big companies to be part of the “woke” universe — and you can just picture the brutal hearings the next two years could bring. “It will be a much more aggressive Republican majority,” said Dan Clifton, the policy director of Strategas, a big asset management and institutional research firm.

But it’s more complicated than MAGA congressmen beating up woke corporations. Kevin McCarthy, who is in line to be the new speaker of the House if the Republicans are in the majority, has been openly dismissive of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ever since the chamber backed 23 House Democrats in the 2020 election. Just this week, Axios reported that Mr. McCarthy told the chamber’s board members that he would not work with the business lobby unless it fired its C.E.O., Suzanne Clark, and replaced the leadership team. (The chamber told Axios that Ms. Clark has the executive committee’s “complete support.”)

Even so, the chamber’s activity seems very much aligned with certain longstanding G.O.P. positions. In the last four months, the chamber has sued the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The lawsuits essentially argue that with the Democrats in charge, the agencies have been overzealous. As the minority party these past two years, Republicans have often made this complaint about the regulatory agencies. If they become the majority, they will be able to drive this home much more forcefully with investigations and hearings.

So what will big business be facing if the Republicans take the House?

Republican strategists say that hearings attacking “woke” corporations are inevitable, and have pointed to a handful of companies that are likely to be asked to testify at such hearings. Disney, for instance. When the company’s C.E.O., Bob Chapek, criticized the Florida law that limits what teachers can say to young students about gender and sexuality — and when Gov. Ron DeSantis responded by stripping the company of a special tax district — the publicity put Disney squarely in the sights of Republican House members."

In Pittsburgh, 40 schools in a district with more than 18,000 students shifted to remote learning, citing health concerns about sweltering classrooms, the district announced. In Grand Rapids, in western Michigan, home to 17,000 students, administrators canceled school for the remainder of the week as temperatures climbed to the 90s on Thursday.

The temperatures in some school buildings were “simply too warm,” the superintendent of schools, Leadriane Roby, said in a statement. “That not only makes the learning environment a challenge, but it also raises a safety concern.”

Poorly cooled or heated school buildings in the United States is far from a new concern, but it is an intensifying worry as more school districts are grappling with aging infrastructure and the effects of climate change. Older buildings often lack central air-conditioning, and even if window air-conditioners are present, they can be ineffective in classrooms packed with dozens of children."

The small community of Atoka, in the Choctaw Nation’s reservation, fell on hard times. Residents had moved away, and downtown buildings were decaying. That was until a restaurant opened there in a former Masonic temple, drawing in half a million visitors in the past two months, many of them dressed in glittery tops and tasseled jackets.

The reason: The restaurant’s co-founder and person it’s named after is the country-music star Reba McEntire, an Atoka County native and a 50-50 partner in the venture with the tribal nation. If all goes to plan, Atoka is in for a full revival — with an airport and manufacturing hub that is scheduled to be built.

Multiply Sabirin by hundreds of thousands, and you begin to see the picture. The United Nations cites estimates that as the crisis escalates toward famine, 1.8 million Somali children under 5 will be acutely malnourished by July.

To visit Somalia is to be dizzied by the world’s nutrition gaps.

Berco’s Popcorn in Chicago offers luxury “billion-dollar popcorn” with gold flakes at $2,500 for a large tin.

A pack of Plumpy’Nut, a high-protein, high-energy food for severely malnourished children like Sabirin, costs 38 cents. Two or three packs a day can revive a child.

Julia Simpson, the president and chief executive of the W.T.T.C., called the report “a big shout-out for nature.”

Alarmingly, the report notes that one in four species worldwide faces the threat of extinction (as assessed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature), and that species abundance, the number of individuals of each species in a particular location, has fallen 68 percent since 1970, according to the World Wildlife Fund. To combat these declines, the report, which has been endorsed by the Secretariat of the U.N. Biodiversity Conference and the World Commission on Protected Areas, offers recommendations that include raising awareness of the importance of biodiversity among travelers; auditing travel companies and those that supply them for their impact on nature; collaborating with local communities as guardians of nature; and investing in species protection and habitat reconstruction.

While the W.T.T.C. has already published a road map to net-zero carbon emissions for the travel industry by 2050, Ms. Simpson calls nature positive tourism “a practical guide for our industry” to protect nature and encourage biodiversity while awaiting more powerful solutions to decarbonize travel, particularly aviation."

Seldom in the history of art have so many masterpieces been vandalized in so little time. In October, major paintings by Van Gogh, Monet and Vermeer were targeted by environmentalist activists as part of a concerted push to raise awareness of the climate emergency and to stop new fossil-fuel projects.

Cans of tomato soup were splattered over Van Gogh’s “Sunflowers” at London’s National Gallery by a pair of activists from the Just Stop Oil movement (while a third captured the act on video). “What is worth more, art or life?” shouted one protester, Phoebe Plummer, 21, as visitors gasped and called for security. “Are you more concerned about the protection of a painting or the protection of our planet and people?”

Later that month, a painting in Monet’s “Grainstacks” series was smeared with mashed potatoes at the Barberini Museum in Potsdam, Germany. And at a museum in The Hague, a man glued his head to Vermeer’s “Girl With a Pearl Earring” while another man, his hand glued to the wall, poured a thick red liquid over him. None of the paintings involved were damaged.

The acts of eco-vandalism seemed aimed at pressuring world leaders to take radical action at the United Nations climate summit the following month. Videos of the attacks were seen by millions of people around the world, including, no doubt, the leaders. Yet the attacks also upset many members of the public concerned about art damage, and led the directors of top world museums to issue a stern statement, raising the question of whether art actually is an effective vehicle for protest."

Rather than plant grass that would need constant watering, mowing and fertilizing, it turned to native plants that pretty much took care of themselves. Today, shoulder-high grasses wave in the wind and attract wildlife.

“One plant had yellow finches all around it,” said Patrick J. Garay, vice president of strategic projects at Air Products.

Forget the fuss. Corporate landscapes are going natural these days.

The shift — mirroring what’s happening at public parks, on university campuses and in homeowners’ backyards — is being driven by a growing awareness of the environmental costs of installing and maintaining lawns, clipped hedges and tidy flower borders. New laws ban the use of water for “useless” grass in drought-prone areas, and company sustainability programs encompass the land the buildings sit on. Apps calculate the carbon footprint of landscapes in much the same way that buildings are monitored for greenhouse gas emissions."

So David Lipsky’s new book, “The Parrot and the Igloo,” is a useful corrective; all the more so since Lipsky is a journalist rather than a climate scientist, whose aim is to gather the known facts about climate change and denialism into a compelling narrative that’s easy to grasp. Whether you’re bracing for a hurricane or lolling on the hammock ahead of Labor Day, maybe add that one to your reading list.

Also recommended this week: a history of young activist women, a look at the influential circle of philosophers who called Oxford home in the mid-20th century and a memoir of Central Florida before Disney came to town, along with new fiction from James McBride, Richard Russo, Jenny Xie and more.

The company, Redwood Materials, plans to use the loan to expand a manufacturing campus near Reno, Nev., where it makes some of the components from new and recycled sources. The company was founded by J.B. Straubel, a former top Tesla executive, and has partnerships with Panasonic, Ford Motor, Toyota, Volkswagen and Volvo.

After construction is complete, Redwood aims to produce enough battery materials at the Nevada campus to support production of more than one million electric vehicles a year. The loan will help to create about 3,400 construction jobs, Redwood and the Energy Department said. The company said it expected about 1,600 full-time employees to work at the campus when it was finished.

The announcement was the latest loan from the department to support domestic battery manufacturing as the Biden administration seeks to bring more of the supply chain for electric vehicles to the United States and reduce reliance on China.

In the critical midterm elections, Democrats defied the historical odds as well as an anticipated “red wave” that could have given the Republican Party a substantial majority in the House and a narrower one in the Senate.

With several key races still too close to call, Republicans have an advantage in the House, which could doom President Biden’s legislative agenda and mean more grinding partisan conflict. But the margins are slim, and Democrats could still hold the Senate. Here are updates and five takeaways.

Donald Trump’s position as kingmaker is on shaky ground: Many candidates whom the former president supported underperformed, and his looming presence may have undercut Republicans in some tight races. Right-wing media praised Ron DeSantis, who won re-election as Florida’s governor and is emerging as a 2024 favorite.

Control of the Senate will take weeks to decide, although Republicans now have an easier path to the majority than the Democrats do. In Georgia, the race between Senator Raphael Warnock, the Democrat, and Herschel Walker, the Republican, will go to a runoff next month."

China released more bad economic news on Tuesday, but it was the number that wasn’t included in the official data dump that stood out: Beijing said it would stop publishing figures for youth unemployment, weeks after it hit a record high of 21.3 percent in June.

The decision may be temporary, but it will only make it harder for investors to know what’s happening in the country — and that may be the point. Shares in Hong Kong and Shanghai closed lower again, but, unlike on Monday, the damage didn’t spread across Asia.

China’s economy, the world’s second biggest, is in a prolonged slump. Retail sales and industrial production both missed forecasts in July, Tuesday’s data showed. China’s central bank cut a benchmark lending rate on Tuesday, but that was a far cry from the big-bang stimulus measures investors have been hoping for since the country fell into deflation last month.

That poses a challenge for global growth. The I.M.F. has previously forecast that China would account for 35 percent of global growth this year, but that’s looking less likely. The slowdown is hitting everything from commodities to construction, and some big U.S. companies that operate in China don’t expect a rapid turnaround."

The quiz is simple: It asks you to put eight historical events in chronological order. Times editors choose the events each week, and most are connected to news events from the previous week. In today’s quiz, for example, you’ll notice that one of the events involves the Women’s World Cup and another involves Ivy League admissions.

Like many Morning readers, I’m a game player. I do the Bee and Wordle every day, and I have long been hoping that The Times would expand into historical and trivia quizzes. Flashback represents an early attempt to do so. I’ve had a great time playing the internal versions that my colleagues have shared in recent weeks.

One tip: Pay close attention to the photographs and other visuals. They sometimes contain clues.

For people who want to go deeper, you’ll find links in the game to Times reporting, sometimes including our original coverage of the event from decades past."

Dividends will go up by 10 percent for the quarter, and BP announced $2.75 billion in stock buybacks, following $11.25 billion last year.

Despite those generous payouts, the valuation of companies like BP and Shell, which have embraced climate friendly investments in renewable energy, have substantially lagged behind those of their American rivals, Exxon Mobil and Chevron, which have largely stuck to producing oil and gas.

On Tuesday, investors seemed to welcome the announcement. BP’s share price rose about 8 percent.

The oil and gas business today looks very different from 2020, when Mr. Looney, newly named as chief executive, announced he would pump up investments in clean energy like solar and wind and cut oil and gas production by 40 percent by the end of the decade.

Back then, oil and gas was a troubled business, with some analysts predicting it was in terminal decline as oil giants looked to other investments. BP took $17 billion in write-downs on the value of its oil and gas fields, figuring they were no longer worth the sums on the company’s books. Other companies took similar steps.

Three years later, the landscape has changed. Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, averaged $101 a barrel last year, more than double its price in 2020, and natural gas prices soared, largely because Russia cut off supplies to Europe, pushing oil producers to record profits."

The new leadership of both parties will find it daunting to try to match her performance and political reach, whatever their view of her policy agenda. Ms. Pelosi, the first female speaker, carved a singular path.

Her time in leadership was bracketed by the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol, two seminal events that tested her abilities but also showed a willingness to rise above political differences at times of crisis.

In between was a war in Iraq that she opposed, a harrowing financial crisis that she helped curb, the rise of the Tea Party movement that unseated her, the Trump presidency that she combated with two impeachments, a pandemic that threw Congress and the nation into turmoil, and finally a triumphant legislative push during the first two years of President Biden’s term. While her goals were big, she also devoted herself to — and appeared to relish — the minutiae of vote counting, picking off Democrats one by one until she reached the magic number of 218, usually with a few more tucked away in her purse just in case."

Millennials like himself, the entrepreneur and political newcomer explained to an overflowing audience in Pella, Iowa, “are starved for purpose, meaning and identity”; robbed of those anchors that made America great — “faith, patriotism, hard work, family”; and stumbling from one cult to another — race, gender, sexuality and climate activism. The government “systematically lies to us,” he said. He told another gathering in Indianola, “We face a nonzero risk that the United States of America could cease to exist,” obliterated by the blossoming alliance of Russia and China.

Young Americans, he concluded, have “a black hole in our hearts.”

It is hardly Ronald Reagan’s shining city on the hill, Bill Clinton’s bridge to the 21st century or the countless evocations of American exceptionalism that have buoyed politics for decades now, including those offered by some of his 2024 rivals. And yet somehow his evocation of a generational malaise seems to resonate, at least with the crowds that are packing the restaurants, cafes and even larger venues in the state that will cast the first ballots this January for the Republican presidential nomination.

Noticeably, however, those crowds don’t seem to include many young voters. And many of his views are out of step with those of his generation as well as with the one below it, particularly his positions on climate change — he loudly rejects prescriptions for combating it, like eliminating, or even reducing, the burning of fossil fuels — and the voting age, which he wants to raise, unless young voters can pass a civics test."

That tree was a national champion: 19 feet in circumference, 101 feet tall with a canopy that stretched 100 feet. Our maple, no record-holder, is smaller, about 90 feet tall with a 70-foot canopy, but still of a size one doesn’t see every day.

I can stand underneath the tree in the rain and barely get wet. My husband and I guess the tree is about the age of our old log house, circa 1860, but we’re not sure. Young, perhaps, for maples, which can live up to 300 years. I don’t know if it ever provided sweet sap as other maples have in this valley, but a friend who grew up here and has tapped sugar maples for fifty years says he’s never seen a bigger Acer saccharum.

The maple lives at the bottom of a hill where our children used to ride sleds in winter and jump into colorful leaf piles in autumn. Sometime, long before we arrived at our western Pennsylvania farm 34 years ago, the main trunk split into four. I remember our son climbing into the hollow that formed, where ferns now grow.

The agreement comes as biodiversity is declining worldwide at rates never seen before in human history. Researchers have projected that a million plants and animals are at risk of extinction, many within decades. The last extinction event of that magnitude was the one that killed off the dinosaurs 65 million years ago.

While many scientists and advocates had pushed for even stronger measures, the deal, which includes monitoring mechanisms that previous agreements had lacked, clearly signals increasing momentum around the issue.

“This is a huge moment for nature,” Brian O’Donnell, director of the Campaign for Nature, a coalition of groups pushing for protections, said about the agreement. “This is a scale of conservation that we haven’t seen ever attempted before.”"

ezra klein

From New York Times Opinion, this is “The Ezra Klein Show.” Welcome to the Ask Me Anything episode. I’m here with my revered editor, the bringer of gravitas, Aaron Retica. We’ve got tons of questions from the hundreds that you all sent in, which I’m always grateful for, that I’m about to get peppered with. Aaron, it’s good to actually see you in person.

aaron retica

Yeah, I know. We’re live in New York. It is not Saturday night, however. Let’s just get rolling. There’s so many questions. Let’s not waste time. So you’re going on book leave, and many of your listeners were curious what the book is about.

ezra klein

I don’t think this will surprise anybody listening to the show. So I’m co-writing a book with Derek Thompson of The Atlantic, who, if you don’t read him, he’s great, and it’s a book about what I often call supply side progressivism or liberalism that builds what Derek calls abundance, or the abundance agenda. But at its core, where do we have problems, where the fundamental problem is scarcity? We don’t have enough of something we need. And when that problem is located, how do we fix it? Sometimes the necessity here is for the government to create more of something we need, to do clean energy tax credits or a warp speed for vaccines. And sometimes the government is actually making it impossible or very difficult to create the thing we need, say, housing in California. And so those are the layers of the project. And I think the other layer of it is, how did liberalism, and particularly places where liberals govern, become so bad at building? How did the coalition that imagines itself as behind a strong and effective government actually become often unable to run governments that are strong and effective? And so some of the project is unearthing the secondary history of post-20th century liberalism, the rise of the new left, the rise of Nader right, and so on, movements that created a lot of ways in which liberals both want an activist government and then want a lot of ways for people to stand in front of that government and say, stop. You’re not listening to my needs. You’re going to hurt the environment, et cetera. And the point is not that one of these sides is right and one of them is wrong. But you have to understand the way they’ve collided in governance to understand a bunch of the problems we have now and to maybe say, OK, the balance on this is off, given what we’re facing. So that’s the project of the book. I’m going to be off for about three months. Hopefully, I’ll get the book done or finished in that time. We’ll see. But I’m excited about it.

aaron retica

I’m going to push into the content there in a second. But I wanted to ask you one question about collaborating with Derek. So you are a person who is at the center of the process, both for your show and your column. How are you envisioning doing it, a book with someone? I’m just very curious about that. And there are a lot of process questions from your listeners, so I thought I’d ask that.

ezra klein

He’s been on book leave first, due to his schedule, and then I’m going on. One of the reasons I wanted to co-write this book is I found writing my first book, “Why We’re Polarized,” to be an incredibly lonely experience. Almost every creative project I’ve done in my life that I really enjoyed has had somebody else at the center of it with me. In my column, it’s you. On the podcast, it’s the team and particularly Rogé who’s been with the show for so long — Rogé Karma, our senior editor. When I launched at Vox, I did that with Melissa Bell and Matthew Yglesias. When I did “Why We’re Polarized,” it was really just me. It’s not that I didn’t have an editor, Ben Loehnen, who’s great. But for months, it was just me struggling with the page. And a lot of my best thinking is done when I talk. A lot of my best thinking is done in relationship to other people. And I just think it makes me smarter to be working with other people. And I think that it also helps me actually get things done. And I just wanted it to be a less lonely process. There’s, obviously, advantages to doing projects on your own because you have full creative control over them. But there are real disadvantages to it, too. So this was an experiment I wanted to at least attempt.

aaron retica

Yeah, we spend a lot of time on the phone. It’s like old-school columnist editor relationship. All right, let’s dig into the actual material, though, because you and I have worked a lot on this. And there’s been a ton on the show as well. So Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, faced a sharp crisis very recently, where a section of I-95 collapsed. And Joel D. has written in asking us whether the fact that they were actually able to get the section of I-95 that fell open 12 days after it collapsed, what the implications are for a liberalism that builds in that sequence?

ezra klein

So I think this has been a really interesting model because Shapiro’s bragging about it. The Biden administration likes to tell me about the role they played in it. And I think it’s also important to say they did this with union labor. That’s actually been a big part of how they intended it and also how they’ve narrativized it. It wasn’t just that they got this portion built, which was estimated to take months. It’s not at all unusual for a government project, infrastructure project, estimated to take months to take years, and instead, it took days. They were going around the clock. They had a livestream on it. But you have to take seriously what he did. So the Pennsylvania governor has emergency powers during a disaster. And Shapiro signed a proclamation that reads, quote, “I hereby suspend the provisions of any other regulatory statute prescribing the procedures for conduct of commonwealth business or the orders, rules or regulations of any commonwealth agency if strict compliance with the provisions of any statute order, rules, or regulations would, in any way prevent, hinder or delay necessary action in coping with this emergency event.” So I did a piece with you a couple of months back called “Everything-Bagel Liberalism.” And the point of that is that liberals often put a huge number of secondary objectives into a single project. So they want to restore American dominance in semiconductor manufacturing. But then there are also these rules in there for on-site child care, and how to break the contracting into small tasks so you can have a more diverse set of subcontractors, and what sort of community investments you need to make, and your climate action mitigation plan and so on. And one of the points of that piece was you can choose some — here, they chose unions — but you can’t choose all of them. And what they did here, what Shapiro was able to do in Pennsylvania, was he wiped out functionally everything else. You could not sue and stop this project using, say, environmental litigation, which happens on a lot of different projects. They just went too fast, and they wiped a lot of things out. If you listen to the Jen Pahlka episode, all these different states and, of course, the Federal Government have very complicated procurement and contracting rules meant to make sure things are fair, that people who aren’t chosen can challenge. All that was out the window. So I think it’s relevant what they did. But it is also relevant that usually you cannot do this. What they did was radically alter the process by which building happens. And I’ll make one other point about it that I think is a good way to think about it conceptually. What Shapiro, ultimately, said here is that I, Josh Shapiro, who won election with a majority of the vote from the voters in Pennsylvania, I should be trusted with acting in a way that ensures the electorate gets what it wants. In his view in that point, it was the quick rebuilding of I-95. The processes we have are a way of saying, we think that the elected representatives cannot be trusted on this, and so we’re going to hamstring them or tie them up with a lot of other processes meant to allow more voice, meant to allow more opposition, meant to allow more litigation. And you can think that’s right or wrong. But what’s I think valuable about seeing what happened in Pennsylvania is that there’s nothing about government doing projects that means they can’t be done fast. There’s nothing about unions doing projects that means they can’t be done fast. But you have to make some choices. So you could just give more governors and give the president more emergency powers and wipe out a lot of procurement rules. But that would upset a lot of people. And so what Pennsylvania shows is it is possible. But what the invoking of these emergency powers also shows is it cannot be done under the normal policies that the governors use. And the obvious thrill that everybody involved in it now feels should make us wonder if we’re not missing something in our normal processes. Emergency processes shouldn’t make you feel so much happier than normal processes. That’s not normally how that goes.

aaron retica

Right. But OK, virtually no one would say, well, we really would like to have I-95 be collapsed. No one wants that, so the emergency is going to override, very happily, the conditions that normally would obtain. But how are you going to transfer that emergency process to an ordinary process, where people are going to have objections, some of which are going to be reasonable, many of which are going to be unreasonable? It’s easy to say, OK, great. They did it in 12 days. But it was an emergency, and so they acted like it was an emergency.

ezra klein

I think, first, there’s a question of what in our minds should be an emergency. My interest in this topic is driven, more than anything else, by decarbonization. If you believe that climate is an emergency — and I do believe it’s an emergency. Now, it’s an emergency playing out over years and decades, not days.

aaron retica

The summer seems to agree with you.

ezra klein

The summer seems to agree with me. Then I think you need to — and this is the big argument inside, I think, this whole area — then I think you need to begin saying our processes don’t work for this kind of emergency. This is a point now I’ve made in podcasts and columns. But the largest solar farm in America is something on the order of 585 megawatts. We’re going to need to build two 400-megawatt solar power facilities a week for 30 years to hit a middle-of-the-road renewables pathway. We do not have the capacity to do that. That should be understood as an emergency, not something we can approach with business as normal. This is a point, as you know, I’m making a column that will probably be up by the time this the show comes. But to not choose to change processes is to choose right now. It is to choose to absorb the problems of climate change at a higher level. Now, look. Everything is about where you put the dial, and you’re not going to go to full wipe out all the procurement rules. And nor should you. You’re not going to go to full wipe out all the environmental litigation. Nor should you. But there is space between here and there. And if we want to do a bunch of things that I think we should want to do, then we’re going to have to move in that direction. And if we don’t want to do it, then we’re just going to have to say, OK, we’re OK with the housing markets looking like they do in superstar cities. We’re OK with missing our Paris Climate Accord targets by a lot, not by a little. We’re OK with a lot of things that we could fix, and we’re OK with liberal government having the accurate reputation, at least in America, that it cannot build the projects it promises to build. You can’t have high-speed rail in California. You can’t get the Big Dig done at the cost and time you said it would. The Second Avenue subway is going to be a total cost disaster. Maybe if you try to build a bunch of miles of bike lanes in San Francisco, it’s going to take you a decade. That is also a choice to say that’s OK and we prefer the outcome of these processes because we think there’s enough voice and we think that preventing the bad projects is worth it. You can also, hopefully, make things quicker for good projects and slower for bad ones. It doesn’t have to be a process that cannot make any distinctions between what you’re building.

aaron retica

OK. So that brings us to Joel’s follow-up question. Joel is the star of the beginning of the show here. So is there a version of permitting reform that would actually be a win-win for environmental justice community input and for building faster? Or do you see the values as inherently zero sum?

ezra klein

I think it depends a little bit on which values we’re talking about. But let’s take environmental justice and building faster before we take on community input. And there, I think it’s pretty straightforward. People sometimes talk about this as a, quote, green pass. I think we know which projects are meant to be environmentally more sustainable, and I think those should have a streamlined way forward. So there’s a good paper that I mentioned in the podcast with Robinson Meyer called “The Greens’ Dilemma.” and the law professors who wrote that paper, they talk about a number of examples where the government — a very famous one is base-closing commissions — that basically identifies questions around military base closing. And it has a streamlined, fast-tracked up-or-down vote way of doing that. And you can imagine a certain set of processes that would be fast tracked into that. If you’re working on decarbonization, for instance — it’s renewable energy, not fossil fuel energy — maybe you have a quicker path through environmental review. Now, there are a lot of things that aren’t as environmental review here. So it does depend on what you’re talking about. But we’re seeing this begin to happen. Affordable housing in California has been sped past a bunch of points in the process it used to have to go through whereas market rate housing doesn’t always get that. So you can make decisions about what it is you’re trying to speed up. Community input is just tough because I think a lot gets hidden in that term — which community having what kind of input? There are times when the processes we have allow communities, and particularly affected communities, to come to the table, for instance, or come into the process and be heard in a way they wouldn’t otherwise. There are also a lot of ways in which these processes often create space for the status quo to take something over. Very famously, I think all over the country, wealthy homeowners are very good at manipulating the planning process. So you can’t build below market rate homes, and you can’t build many homes at all in very, very desirable and very, very economically important areas. So which community is getting input, the community that lives there now, the community that would like to live there, the community that has time to show up to all these meetings that most people don’t even know are going on? There’s a huge amount of power that is wielded in meetings around the regulatory process for basically any major bill you can think of. Most people never know those meetings happen. But every lobbyist knows when those meetings happen, and moneyed interests spend a lot of money making sure their interests are heard and their thinking is heard at these meetings. So this is a very tough thing to get right. But a critique that many in this area make — Jerusalem Demsas at The Atlantic has, I think, written great pieces on this — and that I agree with is that there is a difference between input and representative input. Processes get captured. And so there is often a question of what level and layer you’re having people get engaged at. The fact that there was a meeting and some people showed up does not mean that what got heard at that meeting was the sentiment of the community. I’ve sat in S.F. city council meetings, And one thing that came up was whether or not a 5G tower was going to get built. And person after person after person after person there attacked the 5G tower. The only people who showed up at the 5G tower part of this planning meeting were people who think 5G towers potentially give you cancer. Now, most people, I think, don’t care that much about 5G towers. And to the extent they had to make a choice, they want to have fast internet. And so in the end, the 5G tower won. But whatever was happening at that meeting, it was community input, but it wasn’t representative of the community. And this is a place where we do have representative government. And to my point about Shapiro, a minute ago, oftentimes, I think a good way to have broader community input is to actually give power to elected representatives. There should be checks on that, but they shouldn’t be completely unable to do the things that they just got elected by most of the voters in a much higher turnout political participation domain to do. So again, it’s all about where you hit the dial here. You can go too far in any direction. But I think community input is complicated. Oftentimes, we are not hearing from the community. We are hearing from a subset of affected interests who know how to manipulate the levers of power. And we should be careful about analogizing those.

aaron retica

This goes right to what Tony C. wants to know about, which is: How should a climate-conscious member of society think about the Biden administration in the context of climate change? Do you think a Biden is a net positive or a net negative for our environment? And he’s thinking, of course, about permitting fossil fuel extraction and so on.

ezra klein

I just put this on — and this is meant as no critique of Tony. I just put this on because, if you’re in an information loop, where this question feels really possibly like it could come out either way to you — is Joe Biden who has presided over the single largest set of climate investments ever and created a whole new structure in which climate infrastructure will be built — the IRA alone at this point is judged at something like $380 billion over 10 years, but as we talked about in the Robinson Meyer episode, maybe it’s really going to be $500 billion, maybe $1 trillion in climate investments. And on the other side, they’ve permitted some near-term drilling and made it a little bit easier during an energy crunch to build more. These things are so out of proportion to each other that I think the way in which people get upset about the places Biden diverges from them say on social media, it’s hard sometimes to keep things in perspective. But Biden is the most successful pro-climate president there has ever been in this country. Climate is a relatively new issue, but obviously, Trump was a disaster. He’s done far more than Obama just because of where the issue is and where the political coalitions are, far more than Clinton, certainly far more than George W. Bush. And he’s given us a shot at building this stuff. We may fail, but Biden has completely changed the game. For so long, the whole of the environmental fight on climate was, can we just figure out some way to get the money to do what we need to do? Now, to everything we’re talking about, the conversation has actually changed to the money is there. Can we actually build it? Can we actually translate all this legislation into the decarbonization infrastructure we need in the real world? That is an astonishing achievement. And it actually slightly saddens me that anybody would look at the Biden administration and what they’ve done at this point, where they really — they got this over the line. Maybe it’s not everything everybody wanted because they had a 50/50 Senate. But they got it over the line, and now the work can really happen. We’ll see what happens. We’ll see if it all works out. Implementation is really tough. This all has to happen in the real world. It’s not just sending checks out from the government. But they have been extraordinarily successful on a pretty hard issue. Climate is not an easy political issue. It’s not one where you have naturally very large constituencies of people who will be immediately benefited by it. They prioritized it. They figured it out. They passed it. They deserve to be applauded. And now, they deserve to be watched over and scrutinized as the real work has to happen. But the stuff they did on the margin to keep energy costs down to not completely destroy their power in the midterms, that’s just politics. But the bulk of their legislation, it’s been an extraordinary climate presidency, given what is actually possible in American politics, not just possible in people’s minds. They deserve the credit on that one.

aaron retica

So T.J. M. has a really interesting question. This was brought up a lot before Biden actually took office. But let me ask you now. Are comparisons between Joe Biden and F.D.R. justified? Have their presidencies been broadly similar?

ezra klein

They’re not justified. Yeah, you’re right that, before Biden came in, and as his agenda expanded, and as also Democrats began in 2020 to think they might get huge congressional majorities, you had this moment of maybe it’ll be an F.D.R.-sized presidency. And this happened with Obama, too. There was like, maybe Obama is the next F.D.R. And I just have a bugaboo about this that F.D.R. was only F.D.R. because of the size of the Congressional majority he got in ‘32, because the Great Depression and the anger at Hoover destroyed the Republican Party. So F.D.R., when he comes in, he has 58 Democratic senators to 36 Republican senators in a much-less polarized time. So he could actually get more from those 36 Republicans but, still, 58 to 36. Biden has a 50/50 Senate, where Vice President Kamala Harris is a tiebreaking vote.

aaron retica

When he first comes in.

ezra klein

When he first comes in, right. And in the House, F.D.R. had 311 Democrats to 117 Republicans. And for Biden, when he first comes in, Democrats have a majority in the single digits. You can’t have an F.D.R.-sized presidency in a polarized political time in a closely divided Congress. And I think this is what people just often miss when they’re trying to judge other presidents against F.D.R. How much legislation a president can pass is dependent on what Congress does. Congress writes legislation and passes it. President can only veto it. And so what F.D.R. had was a destroyed Republican Party, and that wasn’t true for Biden. It wasn’t true for Obama, probably will not be true for the next Democratic president. And that just makes the possibilities more narrow. I think it is really remarkable how much policy Biden and the Democrats passed with a 50/50 Senate. If you had told me in January 2020 that Democrats are going to have a 50/50 Senate, what are they going to get done, I would have said a lot less than they did. A 50/50 Senate is never going to get you a New Deal-sized presidency. It just can’t.

aaron retica

You mentioned Obama. Michelle O. wants to know why you think U.S. health care reform is not much of a hot political item right now.

ezra klein

Ah. My first love.

aaron retica

Your first love.

ezra klein

My first love —

aaron retica

[INAUDIBLE]

ezra klein

— in policy. So yeah. So I covered — for people who have not followed my work in the past — health care reform for years. That was my first major policy issue. And I think there’s a couple of reasons. One is Obama and how successful he actually was. So they passed the Affordable Care Act. If you look at current levels of uninsured non-elderly Americans — because the elderly have Medicare— you have about 27.5 million are uninsured. That’s down from about 50 million, or almost 50 million, before the Affordable Care Act passed. And if you look at who that is, you have a bunch of people in the 10 states that haven’t expanded Medicaid. You do have a lot of people who still can’t afford it. They maybe don’t get employer insurance, but they make enough money that they’re not really eligible for subsidies. So that’s some of the people, too. You do have a big issue among noncitizens who, if they’re newly noncitizens, are not eligible for some of the subsidies or Medicaid in the program. And, of course, undocumented immigrants often are usually ineligible. To mop up the end of the uninsured population, it’s pretty tricky, and you’re dealing with a lot of random issues — the Medicaid issue and states that are fighting Medicaid and so on. So I think that the Affordable Care Act was successful enough that it has drained a lot of the energy from health care reform. That’s one thing. So then there’s another thing, which is that one reason that health care reform had so much energy for so long was that health care cost growth, year after year, was growing so much faster than inflation, so much faster than G.D.P. growth. There’s been a pretty big slowdown in that over the past 10-ish years. The reasons for it are debated. But the huge cost-growth problem we had that led to all this bending the cost curve talk in the Obama administration that made this a huge problem for employers, it’s not that it is entirely gone. But it is not really the fundamental problem anymore. So that doesn’t mean there aren’t ways you could imagine health care being way better. During the 2020 primaries, we had a lot of debates over single payer in the Democratic Party. There’s a new interesting book by Liran Einav and — I might be mispronouncing that — and Amy Finkelstein, who are both great health economists, called “We’ve Got You Covered: Rebooting American Health Care.” You can definitely come up with root and branch reforms of the system that would make something more efficient, more fair, that would cover something closer to everybody. But the system is working well enough for enough people that it is hard to imagine that getting prioritized in the near future. When I think of what I would want, any kind the Congress, any kind of unified Congress and presidency, to make their top priority, it is hard for me to say further health reform. I’d be much more interested in universal baby bonds as with the episode we did recently with Darrick Hamilton. I’d be much more interested in universal pre-K. It’s not that health care is great in this country. It’s not. But political capital is so limited, and enough people here are doing well enough, and the moving it that last couple of miles would be so difficult that I think, when you imagine what are the single bills you could pass that would lead to the largest well-being improvements, it’s hard for me now to say that it’s health care reform, both because its status as an economic problem has abated somewhat and its status as such like, we have this huge uninsured population, has abated somewhat. So I think it’s just become more of one issue among many rather than the central issue that is causing both employers, and budget wonks, and normal people incredible amounts of pain.

aaron retica

Although it hasn’t solved the problem of drug addiction that’s leading to more than 100,000 people dying every year, so.

ezra klein

But that’s a big thing. When we talk about health care reform, we’re typically talking about financial insulation from health care costs. So when you think about what would do the most to improve health now, I think it’s often not health care reform. I think things like an expanded child tax credit would do a lot for people’s health. We know giving people money is good for their health. And baby bonds, I think, have that quality, too. I can think of a lot of things that would be really good for the health of the American population that would probably have a bigger per-dollar payout than health insurance reform, which is what we are really talking about when we talk about health care reform. [MUSIC PLAYING]

aaron retica

Shifting gears a little, Doug A. wants to know what your view on the popular goal of imposing term limits on Congress is, whether you’ve thought about it much either way. And obviously, it would require probably a constitutional amendment to do it, maybe not necessarily but probably. So what are your thoughts on that?

ezra klein

I would say, look at a couple of things. For instance, look at California, where you have term limits for the legislature. I don’t think, in California or other states where you have that, the legislatures are dramatically better or more effective. I think, if you look at Congress, a lot of really great legislators would have been term limited out in a way I don’t think we should think of as a good thing. It takes time to become good at being a member of the House or being a member of the Senate. I don’t think the country would have been better off if Senator Ron Wyden had had to retire after two terms or if Senator Dick Durbin had to do the same. There is a return on experience here, and on connections, and on skills. Joe Biden was, in part, a good legislator over time because he learned things that he didn’t know in his first term or two. He got much more effective over time. So I don’t think when I look at the House, say, and I look at people there, a lot of the legislators I think are the worst are the newest there. They’re just trying to get booked on Fox News or social media. A lot of legislators who are pretty solid there have been there a long time. So even if you take away the political science argument, the term limits end up giving a lot of power to the unelected lobbyist staffer class. I just think if you look at it, it doesn’t look great. I think that most people would come to the conclusion that the better members of both the House and Senate are the ones who have had time to be there longer. Now, there is a problem that incumbency can just feed on itself and people can be there too long. Look at Dianne Feinstein in California for a very extreme example. I think it’s hard to know what to do about that exactly. I will say the place where I strongly support term limits is for the Supreme Court, where I think you should have 12 - or 18-year term limits so that the vacancies that come up are fairly reliable so that different presidents get roughly the same amount per term, so that you don’t have this incentive to name very young people to the Supreme Court, so that things aren’t just tricks of when people die or when they become too incapacitated. I think that lifetime appointments are a dumb idea, just in general. And partly, when you don’t have something like elections that do at least impose some level of accountability, you want to think about term limits. Where you do have elections imposing some degree of accountability, yeah, the incumbency advantage is a real thing. It is also a real thing that voters are participating in. So I think that it is a little bit weird to say that we abstractly know voters are wrong to give the person representing them a third term and we sitting here should tell them they can’t. So yeah, I’ve never been a term limits fan.

aaron retica

Yeah, that’s exactly what you’re saying. It devalues elections in both ways, the lifetime appointments for Supreme Court justices and term limits. Yeah, it robs the people of their power. Tom C. has a hard question for you. He says, I seem to be the only liberal alarmed by the real scandal involving Hunter Biden, but perhaps you feel the same. It seems to have amassed between $10 and $20 million in investments from a coalition of very sketchy Chinese, Ukrainian and Romanian sources, none of which seem to have produced any work product anyone can point to. And it sounds like Hunter, and maybe his Uncle Jim as well, were trafficking in Joe Biden’s name, as Tom C. puts it, by implying it to their marks that the marks would somehow gain access to Joe Biden with their investments. Biden himself simply says that he didn’t involve himself in his son’s business affairs. But are we really just going to let it go at that? And would we if these were Republicans?

ezra klein

I think, in some ways, that last bit is too easy an out.

aaron retica

OK.

ezra klein

We did when it was Republicans. I actually think, in many ways, what Jared Kushner did, raising billions for an investment fund with Saudi Arabia, the amount of direct influence peddling Donald Trump did in office, the way people would try to get access to him by being part of Trump company investments and staying at Trump hotels, and everything, it was more direct. It was much worse. It was much more serious. I think the Hunter Biden scandal is real in the sense of Hunter Biden, the things he’s done are really unsavory. And the thing that has made it not yet a political scandal that is consequential for Joe Biden, except on the right, where I think people want to believe something went wrong, is that nobody can quite point to anything that came out of it from Joe Biden’s governance. No work seems to have come out of this influence peddling. And also not much influence seems to have gotten peddled out of the influence peddling. Now, I’m not against something coming out that shows this was different. If it turns out that President Biden colluded with Hunter and there was some kind of email exchange or some kind of handshake, where, if they would give Hunter this job, they would get this amendment put on the bill or this thing they wanted done, I think that would be a real problem. Correctly so. That would be a real problem. The thing where Biden has had a somewhat laissez faire attitude towards the activities of his absolute mess of an adult son, I think there’s a kind of sympathy that emerges for people in that towards Biden. What was Biden to do exactly? He probably didn’t actually know about a lot of this. A lot of the details coming out with Hunter Biden, the seventh granddaughter, it’s very sad.

aaron retica

It’s incredibly sad.

ezra klein

It’s incredibly sad. You’re watching somebody who was never able to get his life back on track or on track. He definitely influence peddled. He’s hurt a lot of people. He’s clearly hurt himself. He’s clearly hurt his father. And if you read Biden’s book that he wrote some years back when running for president — and I think it was in ‘08, actually — the love he has for Beau and Hunter, his belief that Hunter Biden will become part of Beau Biden’s kind of kitchen cabinet and they would protect each other, and then you see how it turns out, the tragedy of it is immense. But it’s not a scandal for somebody’s son or one of their sons to be a fuckup. It’s a scandal for that to become part of how the federal government wields power. I don’t think the fact that Trump did much worse than this in a very obvious and direct way absolves Biden. What absolves Biden so far is that he doesn’t seem to have done it. And if it comes out that he did it, if it comes out that the way Hunter was getting these deals was that he wasn’t just kind of wink, wink, nod, nodding, that you get some access to Joe Biden but you were actually getting the access to Joe Biden, that would be worse. There’s a part of this question that we didn’t, just to make it shorter, that we didn’t bring up. But Tom C. brought up the old idea of the real scandal is what’s legal. And one thing I would say is that the thing that Hunter Biden here is accused of doing actually does happen all the time in a much more efficacious way. So in Congress and in administrations, people who were very high up aides to senators and chairs in the House and, of course, to presidents do become lobbyists. And then they do work on behalf of other governments and other companies. And they do use their pre-existing relationship with people in power to try to push forward those ideas. Now, Biden wasn’t correctly registered to be a lobbyist and all this different stuff. But the thing being described here happens all the time not from idiot adult kids who don’t know what they’re actually doing and can’t deliver. But Bob Dole — the late Bob Dole was lobbying on behalf of Taiwan and was able to get Trump to break with presidential practice and talk to the leader of Taiwan on the phone very quickly after being elected. These things actually do occur, and they’re in a much broader world of more efficacious influence peddling. The Hunter Biden case is sort of a weird version of that turned into an absurdity that looks worse because it’s Biden’s son but is probably less bad because it doesn’t appear to have worked. But again, evidence could come out that it worked in some consequential way. And that would somewhat change my opinion of it. I will say that, if Republicans want to make hay of this, they are going to have to nominate not Donald Trump.

aaron retica

[LAUGHS]

ezra klein

If this becomes a fight over where was the influence peddling in family-oriented business happening in an administration, and it’s Trump running against Joe Biden, and the scrutiny is now on Jared Kushner’s Saudi-backed venture fund, that’s not going to work out. So in a lot of ways — and it’s been a kind of theme on the show recently — Republicans are going to have to decide, do they want to choose a candidate who is strategically positioned to take advantage of Joe Biden’s weaknesses or not? So far, it seems not. But that’s going to be consequential here, too.

aaron retica

All right. There are just so many good questions here. I’m going to plunge into another one. This one’s coming from Colton L. What kind of work do you think is the most undervalued in contemporary American society based on the pay, the social prestige, and everything else that comes with work that the work requires?

ezra klein

Anything and everything with children. Anything and everything with children. Being a social worker who works with children, being a teacher, being somebody who is a guardian in the foster care system, given how important that work is, it is badly compensated. It doesn’t have terrible prestige compared to some other things, but it doesn’t have nearly the prestige it should. It doesn’t have the rungs on as high on the ladder as it should. There isn’t a kind of elite teacher designation that is sort of like being partner at a very big law firm, where everybody knows like, you’ve really made it, and you’re one of the best at one of the most important things that happens in American or human life. We just really undervalue things with children. We talk about how the children are our future. And we treat them, in many ways, like an afterthought. And we certainly treat the people who are in charge of helping them as an afterthought. The pay, and benefits, and prestige in child care work for young children are just terrible. It’s a total disaster of an industry. This is a place where money really matters. And I’ve said this before on the show that I think in American life, for the most part, prestige follows money. We give the most prestige to things that make the most money. And there are some counter examples. Academia has a little bit more prestige and it has money, oftentimes. But prestige typically follows money. And in not paying well for this stuff, we rob it of prestige. We rob it, to some degree — though, of course, there are amazing people in these industries — of talent. And it’s just not the right societal structure and not something I think we should leave up to the market. Yeah, children can’t pay a lot, and the children who need the most help really can’t pay the most. I think the kids who are in highly selective colleges, who tell their parents they’re going to law school, that is much more comfortable for their parents than, I’m going to become a social worker working with children, or I’m going to work in early childhood education, because you’re assuring yourself a higher salary in the future. And that’s a problem. It should be that, when you say to somebody, I’m going to go become a teacher, what they hear from that is both you’re going to be doing great work and you’re going to be really well off because we’ve decided to compensate that really well because we want the best people becoming teachers. And yeah, it’s just a place where I think we’re failing.

aaron retica

Yeah. It’s just an incredible thing that, in other countries, actually, teachers do — you might be deciding I’m going to be an engineer, I’m going to be a lawyer, or I’m going to be a teacher. And you rarely hear that here, which I do think is a critical part of it.

ezra klein

Just like imagine hearing from a graduate from U.C. Berkeley, I’m going into dermatology, what that calls up versus, I’m going to work in a preschool.

aaron retica

Right.

ezra klein

There’s nothing wrong with dermatologists. They do great work. But we know what is being said when you say I’m going to work in preschools. And that’s — that sounds great, but you’re not going to make much money.

aaron retica

Yeah, no. And then the social prestige thing is more important even than I think you made it sound, actually. I gather that the prestige follows from the money, but it’s still a critical part of it.

ezra klein

And you’re married to a teacher.

aaron retica

I am married to a teacher. I was going to accuse you of pandering on those grounds —

ezra klein

[LAUGHS]

aaron retica

— because I am married to someone who works in early childhood and did face that, where you have people who are like, well, why aren’t you a lawyer? Why aren’t you a professor? Why are you a teacher? And meanwhile, she’s doing all this incredible work with public school second graders.

ezra klein

I’m curious if you see it in the world. When you tell people —

aaron retica

Oh, definitely.

ezra klein

— that you babysit New York Times columnists who act like children, your wife says she works with children.

aaron retica

I was going to make a different version of that joke earlier. I was going to ask whether you believe in lifetime tenure for New York Times columnists and podcasters.

ezra klein

Absolutely not.

aaron retica

[LAUGHS]

ezra klein

Are you kidding me? [LAUGHS]

aaron retica

No, I know you don’t. OK, we’re going to switch gears here into psychedelics to bring a little California into our New York studio. Job F. is asking whether you’ve been following the scientific developments and media hype surrounding psychedelics in the last years. And I will answer that part and say, I know you have because we’ve written about it. But from clinical trials to microdosing to legalization processes in Colorado, Australia — he doesn’t mention Oregon — but also Oregon Indigenous communities, what do you make of all this? What do you think about it?

ezra klein

I have a lot of contrasting thoughts on where psychedelic therapy and help is right now. So one is that the work I’m most interested in — I did a piece on this a while back, and I’d like to check in on it next year sometime — is in Oregon, where they are trying to create a legal, although it will not be federally legal, but a legal pathway and structure for supported psychedelic experiences, which, notably, it’s not just psychedelic therapy. You don’t need a diagnosis to do it. You can just go. They’re trying to figure out how to do the licensing. They’re trying to figure out how to do the support. It looks like it will be fairly expensive. That’s going to be really important because it’s not just about whether or not you can legalize them, but whether or not you can create a structure in which they can be well used. When I look at the research, I think the research on them at this point is quite extraordinary. I would expect them in the real world to underperform the research because the research is being so carefully done. But we’re seeing studies that are suggesting really profound effects on treatment-resistant major depression, profound effects on different kinds of addictions, profound effects just on people’s lives. Putting aside the question of what recognized illnesses and maladies you can help people fix, we have these substances that cost functionally nothing in terms of how much it costs to grow psilocybin-containing mushrooms or synthesize L.S.D., and we can routinely induce experiences that people count as among the most meaningful of their entire lives. And that’s a pretty remarkable thing to keep locked up. I find it kind of astonishing. And it’s not that there aren’t risks. But you can go base jumping legally. You can legally be a base jumper. But you cannot legally take a tab of acid, and sit in your room, and listen to music, and have a sublime musical experience. It just actually strikes me as a very strange way. We let people take all kinds of risks in society. Now, the thing that worries me a lot is the financial land rush here — the number of companies trying to patent it, the number of companies trying to distill these into even more potent and powerful and usable and maybe even appealing forms. And we’re going to see where that goes because it has not yet been legalized enough that you can do that. There’s all this money and investment that is jockeying for the day of legalization, whether that legalization be medical, which is probably going to be, at least nationally, the first step. It seems very plausible that you’re going to get F.D.A. approval for certain kinds of M.D.M.A. and psilocybin treatments in the coming years. But eventually, if it does become legalized the way, say, cannabis is in a number of states — the effects of commercialized cannabis, though some of them have been specifically to my benefit, are not, in my view, an unalloyed good. The amount of money going into very potent edibles and much more potent strains, and packaging, and formats that are much friendlier to kids in any kind of user, it’s fine if you’re somebody who has a fair amount of self-control around these things. But people do get addicted. People say pot isn’t physiologically addicting, but people very much get addicted. And the most money is made on the people who buy the most of them. There are certain breaks in psychedelics that make it a little less likely to go down the same route. But I worry about the amount of money being spent on trying to figure out ways to basically get around the fact that it’s actually really hard on the body and the mind and you develop tolerance to trip a lot. If you get into a situation down the road where the money is made by people who have an out-of-control relationship, that could be very psychologically damaging to people. So I think there’s a lot of promise here, and I think there’s a lot of peril here. But I’m overall optimistic. I do think these are really powerful compounds that can create experiences in people’s lives that both help them get over terrible problems but also help them live a deeper life in relationship to themself and to the world and to nature. And I think getting that right is going to require, though, not just the question of, how do you legalize psychedelic compounds? But how do you create structures for their productive use? How do you create good guides? How do you make integration possible, that kind of period after you’ve had an experience and now you have to sort of figure out what that means for your life? How do you make that affordable to people? That, I think, is where a lot of the rubber is going to hit the road, which is, again, why I think what Oregon is doing is really interesting. But it’s not been untroubled there. But if in 10 years you told me this did not go well, I would not be surprised by that. I’d be saddened by it but not surprised.

aaron retica

We’re going to shift gears again into the heartland of “The Ezra Klein Show” recently, which is A.I. And Joseph C. is wondering how much, if any, credence you give to the simulation hypothesis first discussed about 20 years ago by Nick Bostrom? And obviously, you’ll have to tell us what that is because many people will not know.

ezra klein

I don’t. Just for the record, I really don’t. So the simulation hypothesis is basically the idea that, look. Imagine we became a society capable of running — sufficiently technologically advanced, and we were capable of running simulations of whole societies. We’re not just running SimCity or playing video games. But we can just fire up on the computer and fire up as many of them as we want, whole universes. Obviously, in Bostrom’s view, we would want to do that. And obviously, the simulants within those universes would outnumber the people in base reality. And so if you just assume those two things are true, then you come to the conclusion that, well, probably we’re a simulation because there’s going to be more simulated people than real people. And so why should you think you’re one of the real people? Here’s what I will say about it. And I’ve said this, I think, probably in A.M.A.s before. I think this has a quality of watching a very crude form of monotheism get reinvented by computer programmers, which is why it’s very popular in Silicon Valley. If you take the very crude form of monotheism as, God is like us, like bigger, big throne, long, white beard, more powers, this is God is like us but bigger — computer programmer with more powerful computers, player of simulation video games but with a stronger video game system. And the reason I just don’t buy it — and maybe this is not a good reason; I’m not a credentialed philosopher — I think it is such an extraordinary lack of imagination about how weird ultimate reality probably is, just the idea that the true answer to what’s going on here is so unbelievably simplistic, just like not what is going on here is exactly what we are already doing, just with more G.P.U.s underneath the system. I just think it’s so unlikely that that is the full effect here. I think it’s a kind of a lack of humility about what we almost certainly don’t know. Why, in the simulation, have we created all these other planets? Why have we created a physics with such weird rules such that the world is possibly constantly expanding? Why is there not more life on nearby planets? Is that really how we would create a simulation, a gigantic unimaginably large system of space in which, at least so far, we only know of this one planet with life? The whole thing just strikes me as so incurious, in a way, that I just don’t buy it. I’ve always had a negative reaction to it, but it’s because I think it basically takes our reality, holds what we know about it steady, and then asks a toy question within that. We don’t know anything. We don’t understand how quantum physics works yet. Reality is going to be so much weirder, so much more astonishing than it’s just like us but bigger, just like us but more power. I just don’t buy it.

aaron retica

So talking about power of generative models overall, Jordan A. is wondering, given the power of the A.I. models — and we already know about it, and of course, there’s lots in development as well — to produce convincingly human text at virtually no cost, it seems like we’re likely to see a huge proliferation of A.I. astroturfing in the run up to the 2024 election, which is already upon us. In recent years, we’ve already seen misinformation and disinformation be big issues, both generally and with regard to elections. And so what Jordan A. is asking is what your thoughts are on if there is anything we can do to get ahead of this problem.

ezra klein

I personally go back and forth on this problem. So there’s no doubt that, in A.I., we are creating really powerful machines for creating the raw materials of disinformation — deepfakes and endless amounts of auto-generated textual content and images and videos and sound that sound like they came from the person you’re trying to smear. And the various solutions I’m hearing from within the A.I. world strike me as very unconvincing. The main one you typically hear is that they’re going to try to figure out a way to do digital watermarking, such that something that came out from an A.I. or maybe something that comes out from something real, it gets a watermark of a certain kind, such that it can be digitally read to verify its authenticity. The issue I think with this solution is also why I’m becoming a little bit somehow less worried about the problem, which is that the people who you’re worried about picking this stuff up, they don’t care about your digital watermark. That’s actually misunderstanding, I think, quite profoundly, the fake news problem. Fake news works when you are giving people something they already want to believe, that they do not want to check. That is the main way fake news works. It’s not like people can’t go to The New York Times to check something. They don’t want to. They don’t want to be told this isn’t true, or they don’t trust The New York Times or whatever. The reason people believed in QAnon isn’t because nobody had said to them 4Chan is not a reliable source of information. And so we actually also already have so much capacity to alter photographs, to spread misinformation, to send around email forwards full of bullshit. I’m not sure what the delta is. I’m not sure what the open space is in terms of people who are the market for this kind of disinformation and don’t have enough of it to work with. Another way of putting it is, is the boundary on disinformation and misinformation, at this point in human history, really that it is too hard to produce? I don’t really think it is. And I think it’s much more likely that you enter into a kind of cynical collapse of trust than an era of rampant disinformation. If you don’t believe that you can trust these videos coming around — and you often can’t already. There are all these edited videos made to make it look like Joe Biden is having much more trouble speaking than he actually is. This stuff is already around if you want it. We’re perfectly good at creating it now. It becomes easier. But I think the issue is actually the audience. And maybe better stuff increases the audience a little bit, although also the knowledge that there’s better disinformation floating around might make the audience a little bit more skeptical. But I think the issue is an audience problem, like a demand problem, not a supply problem. And worrying too much about the A.I. side of it frames it as a supply problem and not a demand problem. So that’s my slightly more optimistic take. I think that the demand for this is already being fairly well met. And I’m a little skeptical, at least in the near term, that shifting the supply on it is going to radically change the equilibrium.

aaron retica

I just saw this really interesting documentary about Umberto Eco. And he talks in there about all these fake documents that have profoundly affected real history.

ezra klein

Right, Protocols of the Elders of Zion.

aaron retica

That’s the example that he gives, yeah.

ezra klein

I always say this about fake news — fake news is not worse today than it has been at other points in history. [MUSIC PLAYING]

aaron retica

So I mentioned earlier that there were a lot of questions about the show and your process and how you think about things. And we’re going to go into a sequence of those now. Let’s start with Audrey C. A big chunk of what I seem to take out of listening to the podcast is an understanding of what it is to have a good conversation. So example, you push back on something a guest argues in an elaborate and a gentle way. In response, the guest doesn’t always really address your point but, instead, reformulate something that the guest has already said before. My brain goes, this person should get a second push back. He’s not answering. But then you don’t go for it, which I come to appreciate very much as the guest is smart and honest enough. And if they didn’t answer, there has to be a reason, maybe that there just is no answer. So the question that Audrey actually wants to ask is, while making the show, what is it that you’re learning about what makes a good conversation?

ezra klein

I just so enjoyed this question because it answers itself so well. That’s exactly true. There are certain kinds of conversations where pinning somebody down and making it unbelievably clear that they’re not answering a question is important.

aaron retica

The Meet the Press approach.

ezra klein

Yeah, the Meet the Press approach. When you’re trying to understand how somebody thinks, if they’re not answering a question, they often have a reason. Sometimes their non-answer is the answer. It’s what they on the topic. It’s how far their thinking goes. If they don’t have a great answer for it, that’s where their thinking is at that point. So I tend to have a — personally, and I think this is how conversations work between people. If I’ve asked somebody a question twice and I find the answer unsatisfying but I think that’s the answer I have to give me, I’m not asking them three or four or five times just to show that I can embarrass them. I don’t want to say there’s never a time for that. There is. If I had the president on, that requires a different kind of interviewing. But I do think there is a problem in a lot of interviewing around politics that it becomes performative. I think the audience is smart. It’s why I love this question. Audrey understands exactly what’s happening here. The audience is a full engaged intellectual participant in the conversation. They’re not talking, but they are evaluating. Oftentimes, I will get emails that are really like, why didn’t you throw the final punch? And the answer is like, that’s not what we’re doing here. I’m not trying to embarrass a person in front of you. So then I just say, in terms of what makes a good conversation, I think that’s a very big question. And I don’t have any one answer to it. But sometimes I think it’s knowing what you want out of a conversation. And I think people are tuned to expect in politics that what makes a good conversation is some kind of persuasion. People really want to see somebody persuaded of something they don’t believe or see an argument torn down. And I don’t think that’s mostly what makes for a good conversations. And I also don’t think that typically works or even makes for good persuasion. I think a lot of the persuasion that has happened, as a result of this show, happens after it ends as people think about what they’ve said or what they haven’t said or people reflect on it. Certainly, that’s true for me. And I think a good conversation is often people showing up in the same spirit of openness and exchange. And if you don’t model that as a host, they’re not going to bring that to you as a guest.

aaron retica

When we were talking about the midterms last year, we talked a little bit about this. And you just alluded to it at the beginning of the show about how so many public conversations — you were talking about community board meetings, or as we call them here in New York, are so performative and non-real. And I think one of the things that’s interesting about the show — and not just your show but just the whole podcast revolution — is that you have these semiprivate conversations that are happening in public, which is much more interesting than the conversations that are happening in public. And I think that’s a big part of what’s interesting as well, which actually leads us, interestingly, to the next question from Chris M. Could you share details around your process for digesting and retaining information around such a broad, wide array of topics? Are you an avid note taker? And if so, what have you found works best?

ezra klein

This is a question I think we get basically every A.M.A., and the reason I’m doing it this time is something in my process changed. So we’ll talk about this more in a minute, but I moved to New York. I now work out of The New York Times office in beautiful Times Square. And there are some advantages of coming into the office and some disadvantages. The commute is a lot of time. I get to work near you, which is a more positive thing. But the unexpected advantage is the access to an industrial-strength printer.

aaron retica

[LAUGHS]

ezra klein

And Aaron’s probably laughing because just my desk is just covered in paper now. And I had a LaserJet at home, and I would print things out. But it felt wasteful, somehow, to print out every article I’m reading for a podcast. But I think I get 50 percent more, 100 percent more out of my prep doing it on paper, particularly when it’s articles and shorter things as opposed to books, doing it on paper than doing it on a screen. Doing any prep on my actual computer, where I have that many distractions, I can do it. And I get something out of it. But it is much worse. And so I don’t have an extremely structured process in the sense of this is how I take notes, or here’s my system of markings, or whatever. But at this point, my process is I print everything. I have this huge pile of paper. And I sit at a small table with a pen, and I go through it. And the focus that has offered has actually been a really big step forward for me in prep, from a very simple thing. So that’s been nice and been a change and, obviously, something that connects to things like the Maryanne Wolf conversation, if people want to go back to that, just very much about the way reading in different mediums will change the way you reabsorb and engage with information. But I’ve been surprised how true I’ve been finding that.

aaron retica

Yeah. That episode is a favorite of mine, and “Proust and the Squid,” her book is also incredible on that subject. OK, so let’s talk about diminishing focus. Sam M. asks, well, says, I use Twitter for a long time. I talked about how it was great for three things. I like to stay up with news, politics and sports, the latter of which, I will just inform the Ezra Klein audience, Ezra Klein has no interest in. So we’ll focus on —

ezra klein

It’s not interest in. It’s a lack of knowledge and ... interest. [LAUGHS]

aaron retica

[LAUGHS] Yeah, exactly. I know Ezra logged off long ago, and that’s why I’m writing. Since leaving, I found a much better attention span for reading articles, so that gets to what you were just talking about. With all that, I still feel like I’m missing things that I did get from Twitter. I’m missing people’s thoughts on issues they don’t write articles or podcasts about. I’m missing that collective feeling when it seems like everyone on Twitter is reacting to the same thing. So Sam wants to know what your thoughts are and how you handled leaving Twitter. Is there anything about it that you missed? What did you do to compensate for what you missed? And how do you stay up to date on current events?

ezra klein

I did leave Twitter. And I’ll note that I’ve been playing around with Threads a bit, and I want to come back to that. And one reason I left Twitter, which is before Musk completed his purchase of it but when that was in the offing, but the problems with Twitter, for me, predated Elon Musk. I did a piece about Musk buying Twitter called “Elon Musk Will Get Twitter Because He Gets Twitter” or something like that. People can search it. I think it has proven my most prescient piece of that year. And the point was that he was going to take what was worst about Twitter because he was somebody who likes what was worst about Twitter, accelerate that, and so heighten the contradictions of an already troubled platform that it would just slowly drive lots of people off of it. Not everybody, but it was just going to turn the balance enough that people were going to leave something or want to leave something they already didn’t like. But I will die on this hill. Twitter is a bad way to be informed about the world. It’s just a bad way to do it. And it’s to the point I was making a minute ago about printing out your articles. It’s about what you’re not doing when you’re on Twitter. And the best way I’ve found to articulate this is I think there’s a really profound difference between feeling informed and being informed. And I think Twitter and, frankly, a lot of things in social media, specialize in giving people, particularly jittery info-hungry journalistic types, the feeling of being informed. But the people who I think of as most informed are the ones who seem the best at not doing things on Twitter. There’s almost nobody whose knowledge of things is really Twitter-based knowledge or communicated primarily through Twitter who I find that is where I get my information and really value it. For instance, Sam misses a feeling when it seems like everyone on Twitter is reacting to the same thing. And I would say, typically, what they are reacting to is the wrong thing reacting to. So I have a burner account on Twitter for when I need to read something that’s on there. And I happen to have to use it on the day there was a huge amount of debate about Joe Rogan demanding or challenging or offering money for this vaccine specialist to debate R.F.K. Jr. on Rogan’s show. And everybody in my feed, like Nate Silver, everybody was commenting on this. And they were all on the same thing. And in a way, being there made me feel like I was informed. I knew what the zeitgeist was that day. I was seeing the conversation. And it was an extraordinarily dumb conversation. It was just a bad thing to allow into your mental space for that whole day. You would have just been better off reading a report about homelessness or whatever. And so, to me, in terms of being informed about the world, actually, one of the really difficult disciplines is not letting the wrong mediums or the wrong people decide what you’re thinking about, not being too plugged into a conversation if you think that conversation has turned toxic, or you think the conversation has turned trivial, or you think that conversation is being driven by algorithmic dynamics that do not serve you. That’s my view on Twitter. I’ve been playing around with Threads, which I enjoy at this moment in time — and may not continue to; we’ll see how it evolves. But I don’t fool myself into thinking what I’m doing there is informing myself. I would be much better off reading the paper New York Times than screwing around on Threads. Threads is a fun way for me to sometimes screw around when I have a couple of minutes. The reason I answer this with some passion is I think this has become a really bad meme inside journalism, that has been bad in particular for young journalists, who their colleagues are on Twitter. Their future and current bosses are often on Twitter. It feels like you’re supposed to be there or Threads or whatever. And that is time, when you’re spending a lot of time on Twitter, that you may not be spending doing the reading, doing the reporting, seeing things that other people aren’t seeing because they’re inside the newspaper or the magazine. In many ways, reading an issue of The Economist doesn’t give me the same feeling of being informed that being on social media does because I don’t feel like I know what all the people who I’m supposed to know are thinking are thinking about. But I think it leads me to be much more informed, actually informed. I’m reading about things I didn’t already know about. I’m getting ideas for things I didn’t have ideas on before. So I don’t want to say you can’t learn anything on Twitter. It does give you some good links and this and that. But there are better places to find that stuff, in my view. And I would say the same thing about Threads, by the way, and the same thing about Bluesky and Mastodon and Facebook and all the rest of it. I don’t think — if you just look at the evolution of the news media and information, I just don’t think you can look at us today and look at us like 10 or 15 years ago and say this is definitely gotten better. We’re just more informed or focusing on more of the right things. The public has a better sense of what’s going on. There’s more agreement on the fundamental questions being debated. And if things aren’t getting better, then I think it should lead you to really be skeptical of claims that the platforms on which people are operating are improving things.

aaron retica

So besides getting to hang out with me, which you mentioned earlier, which is a small part of your move, Laura C. is wondering why you moved to New York, where I will just say have not lived before. And she’s saying, I may have missed it but haven’t heard you explain it. So can you tell your listeners why you’re here?

ezra klein

Yeah, I think this is probably our most popular question on this round.

aaron retica

There were a lot of these.

ezra klein

And there were some that were sort of offended, that had this quality of, how dare you move to New York and not explain why. And the answer is largely that it’s personal, that we moved to be closer to my wife’s family. There were relevant considerations around both of our offices, and so New York just made a lot of sense. We have and had more family support. We have a good community here. And we have offices here. And that explains all of it.

aaron retica

So Nolan M. is wondering about something that you and I talked about the last time we did this, actually. At the end of last year, you talked about a goal of incorporating a Sabbath or a day of rest into your life for 2023, and Nolan is wondering if you have routinely incorporated a kind of Sabbath into your life and what the challenges that have prevented you from doing so. So you and I talk about this constantly because we try to leave Saturday sacrosanct without being particularly religious about it. But we have sometimes failed because your column, of course, appears digitally on Sunday morning, although we’re pretty good about it. But you feel very deeply about stopping time. So could you talk about that?

ezra klein

Yeah. I put this mainly in to be accountable, having done this Sabbath episode. And the answer is I have tried a lot of things that have not yet worked. And the issue is that what I would like is a day of rest, a cathedral in time, a space to slow down. And what my children would like is not that. [LAUGHS] And so we’ve done Tot Shabbats and that kind of thing. And I tried pretty hard, as you say, not to work on the Saturday. But I’ve definitely found that there is a tension between the thing that I’m often seeking to feel personally, like as an individual, individuated human for my children, and the thing that just being a parent of a four-year-old and a 22-month-old demands, which is my Saturdays are spent. I’ve taken them to Tot Shabbats and things, but they just run around the whole time, which is what a Tot Shabbat is. And that’s really beautiful, and I try to have Saturday be more of a family day. And all that works out pretty well. And it’s really still just a lot of going to playgrounds and managing nap times. And all the other kids have their birthdays on Saturdays, so you got to take your kid to the birthdays. And it’s not bad. But I have found the difficulty of actually getting over the hump as a young family to finding a little bit more of that quieter, out-of-time feeling, the kids still need their routine. And I’ve taken a fair amount of comfort from Judith Shulevitz, who was my guest on the Sabbath episode, saying that, until her kids were about five, it was kind of catch as catch can. And they were working at it. So I hope that I am building some foundations and intentions that are a good base on which to work in the future.

aaron retica

What do you want from not working? What is it you’re trying to get?

ezra klein

It’s not the not working. I would like to have a day where I have a different experience and relationship to time and productivity. And I don’t mean productivity just in what I create for The New York Times. I mean it in just the constant getting things done, the constant feeling that the sand of my hourglass is slipping into Google calendar blocks endlessly —

aaron retica

[LAUGHS]

ezra klein

— and that my time is almost always spoken for.

aaron retica

Right. What am I doing today?

ezra klein

Yeah.

aaron retica

Look at the calendar.

ezra klein

Look at the calendar. Yeah. I have a real, I mean real, discomfort with modern Google calendar culture. I think the fact that anybody can just put anything on your calendar, just that this has become the way we act —

aaron retica

There’s a killer there. They say, I’m going to put some time on your calendar. And I always think, well, actually, you’re doing the exact opposite.

ezra klein

[LAUGHS]

aaron retica

You are taking time away from me.

ezra klein

It would be a little bit to me like, if everybody had sort of access in a way to your bank account, and they could say like, you’re going to spend — I’d like you to spend $80 on this. And you could go and say, no, I’m not going to. But then anybody could allocate your money however they wanted if they had access, and then you had to go in and affirmatively take it back. It’s not a problem exactly. I understand why modern organizations have to work like this. But I would like a different relationship to time. I’m really moved by the Heschel “cathedral in time” kind of thing. But it does require a certain amount of autonomy. And I think the nature of being a parent of kids is that it’s just not much autonomy. And weekends are really for them. During the week, we have to work. Or both my partner and I work full time or even more than that. And so it does have to be oriented around their needs. So I think the fundamental tension between what I wanted out of Shabbat and what I’ve been able to get with it is that I think what I want is about what I want and what is possible is what my family needs. And that’s totally OK. That is a phase of life.

aaron retica

Something you and I talk about a lot and that we both — this is also another way of stopping our experiencing time that we don’t get to talk about, really, in the column is music. I have failed so far in my attempts to get you interested in earlier classical music and jazz. And I’ve been trying to get Ezra interested in Keith Jarrett without success. But I did want to ask you for three music recommendations for your listeners because I know you’re always pushing that thinking in that kind of way.

ezra klein

Always my favorite question. [LAUGHS] So yeah, so I came prepared. So somebody we both quite like, my first recommendation, which is probably the deepest music experience I’ve had over the past six months — I’m a big Caroline Shaw fan. And she did an album with the Attica Quartet, who are also amazing, called “Orange.” It won a Grammy a year or two ago. And there’s a sequence of songs on that album called “Plan & Elevation.” But I really like this one called “The Herbaceous Border.” And it’s all strings. And I think I’m going to try to sell it because I’m worried, if I don’t sell it, people won’t try to listen to it. But one reason it actually unites the conversation we were just having is, somehow, it’s become a song for me very associated with my children. So Shaw has talked about some of her music as being motivated by, what would it be like to be an ant going through the forest? And I can kind of hear that in this sequence of songs. And in this one, in particular, there’s this moment in which it ends up in frenzy. And then it stops. And it starts to come back very slowly, and almost playfully, and curiously. And for some reason, I’m very moved by it. It always makes me think of my children waking up in the morning. You have these days, and oftentimes, to me, the day feels like it ends in a kind of frenzy, between dinner, and bedtime, and you’re exhausted, and everybody needs a bath, and somebody’s crying. And then it’s like, every day with them, not with me — me, I wake up. I’m like, what’s on the calendar? What’s happening in the news? What do I have to do today? I hold everything of the day before with me. And they wake up, and it’s like, what’s today’s adventure? What are we doing today? They wake up fresh in this way that to me is really beautiful. And somehow, this particular song has become very moving to me in wanting to meet them in that. So you’ll know, I think, what I mean or what part I mean when you listen to it, which I hope you do. So then the other — probably the thing I’ve listened to most this year — and this was a recommendation from our engineer, Jeff Geld — but Fred again.., who is known for sample-heavy dance music. He’s a protege of Brian Eno. If you ever follow N.P.R.‘s Tiny Desk series, he did the best tiny desk I’ve ever seen. And he live loops his music built entirely out of instruments he can play there. There are vocal samples, but the instruments are things he can play in that little room. So it’s functionally analog. And it’s just virtuosic. It’s amazing to watch on YouTube. It’s great to listen to. A friend of mine made the point that it sounds, in ways, like Steve Reich, which I think is absolutely true, which I didn’t notice until he said it. But people on the show know I love Steve Reich. And I just think it’s awesome. I kind of can’t imagine the person who would watch it and not think it’s cool. So check out Fred again..‘s Tiny Desk on YouTube. I’ll save you on something much dancier and a little harder. His album “USB” didn’t connect for me initially, but lately, it’s been very much living in my head. And then the final one, which is just a little easier than the other two, is Maribou State. I find I go back to them a lot for music that is instrumentally interesting but also very warm and very inviting, something — you don’t really put on Caroline Shaw when you’re cooking dinner with your friends, but this really works for that. And I figure the song I’ll go with here is “Midas.”

aaron retica

OK, great. Well, on behalf of everyone here and all your listeners, we wish you a very merry book leave and hope you get a lot done. Let’s hope time stops for in and just the right ways so that you can dig down deep, which is, as we’ve been talking about in a million different ways today, really the hardest problem of all, how to focus, how to concentrate, and how to really drill down into the things that actually make the world what they are.

The warning comes as the world deals with overlapping crises — a pandemic that crippled economies and strained public health systems and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which disrupted global supply chains and hurt international trade ties. The threat of a more protracted slump coincides with new signs of stress in the world’s financial system as a series of banking crises threaten to undermine economic growth.

The World Bank projected in a new report that average potential global output is poised to fall to a 30-year low of 2.2 percent per year between 2023 and 2030. That would be a sharp decline from 3.5 percent per year during the first decade of this century.

The falloff will be even more pronounced for developing economies, which grew at an average annual rate of 6 percent from 2000 to 2010; that rate could decline to 4 percent this decade."

The mountains, waterfalls and cliffs that draw climbers are falling apart. Warmer winters, melting glaciers and summer droughts and heat waves make spending time in the mountains riskier every year. This is ominous not only for climbers but for all of us, a portent of the warming planet.

This summer, local guides suspended climbs above Chamonix, France, for fear that the permafrost (embedded deep in the surface and gluing the peaks together) had thawed. A glacier collapsed on the Marmolada in the Italian Dolomites, killing 11 people, including two local mountain guides. The glacier was in decline, Tristan Kennedy reported in Wired magazine this summer, but “there was very little to suggest this slow death spiral was about to accelerate so violently.”

Silas Rossi, one of a handful of American guides who work in New England in the winter and in the Alps for the summer season, said traditional risks inherent in climbing are growing harder to predict. The dangers of avalanches and ice and rock falls have been amplified. “The term ‘unprecedented’ gets thrown around a lot,” he told me. “But I think it’s actually true. We don’t have historical data to rely on to make judgments about these events.”

The scarcity of ice-climbing terrain and the growing popularity of the sport are colliding. Paul McCoy, who runs the Mount Washington Valley Ice Fest, told me that the ice in the name is no longer a given for the event. “Rain events are just more and more common,” he said. “It’s stressful. It almost keeps me up at night.”

In a study coordinated by the American Alpine Club, a team of researchers focused on ice-climbing conditions in the Mount Washington Valley from 2001 to 2021 to project the sport’s future in the region. Relying on anecdotal and photographic evidence from area guides, as well as existing climate models, the team came up with scenarios for what winter climbing would look like in 2100. Without a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by the end of the century, the average annual number of climbable days may shrink to just 30 in the region from the nearly 100 over the study period. Already, the researchers found, midwinter conditions are increasingly springlike, increasing the hazards for climbers."

It also lacks major cuts to other domestic spending, instead reducing its growth by a few percentage points over the next two years.

Republicans were able to use their control of the House to insist on several policy changes, including lower nonmilitary spending; work requirements in anti-poverty programs; less funding for the enforcement of tax laws; and approval of an Appalachian gas pipeline. Democrats protected their biggest policy goals, including recent legislation on clean energy, health care and infrastructure. Biden may also be able to minimize the impact the bill’s spending cuts (like those related to tax enforcement) by later moving money from one program to another.

The fate of Biden’s climate policies seems especially important. The House bill not only protects all the clean energy subsidies passed last year, but also includes a bipartisan priority known as permitting reform that has the potential to remove some of the bureaucratic obstacles to major clean-energy projects.

I know some climate advocates are nonetheless angry because of the Appalachian pipeline, but I think they’re missing the big picture. Presidents do not have magical powers, and Biden has demonstrated that climate change is a top priority for him. “This is the thing the Climate Left keeps not acknowledging,” Matthew Yglesias wrote in his Substack newsletter this week.

Given the radicalism of today’s Republican Party and its tolerance for political chaos, there was a real risk that these debt ceiling talks would cause an economic crisis. Instead, they led to a classic political deal that left untouched the major accomplishes of Biden’s first term. It is a reminder that he is the most successful bipartisan negotiator to occupy the White House in decades."

It behooves the United States to reassure those who may be open to reassurance. America and China are struggling with many of the same challenges: how to ensure what President Xi Jinping has termed “common prosperity” in an age of income inequality; how to rein in the worst excesses of capitalism without losing its vital creative forces; how to care for an aging population and young people who want more out of life than work; how to slow the pace of climate change and to manage its disruptive impacts, including mass migration.

The core of America’s China strategy, building stronger relationships with our allies, is sound policy. Over time, the United States ought to seek a greater alignment between its economic interests and other national goals. The president’s budget proposal, released on Thursday, repeats some of the language from Mr. Blinken’s speech last year and proposes several billion dollars of foreign aid and investments to buttress U.S. allies in the Indo-Pacific region. “We’re trying to make sure that we can outcompete them when it comes to hearts and minds around the globe,” said Shalanda Young, the director of the Office of Management and Budget.

But the United States should not pull back from forums where it has long engaged China.

For example, the World Trade Organization operates a court of appeals that was created to adjudicate trade disputes. The court, however, has not operated in over two years, since the most recently appointed judges completed their terms. New judges cannot be installed without the support of the United States, and the Biden administration has declined to provide that support. The United States has also pulled back from committees at the W.T.O. that write the rules of trade, according to Henry Gao, a professor at Singapore Management University and an expert on the organization. When Mr. Xi proposed in November 2021 to use the W.T.O. as a forum for establishing rules about state-owned enterprises, a key American goal, the United States didn’t show much interest, Mr. Gao said in an interview.

That is a mistake. The construction of a rules-based international order, in which America played the leading role, was one of the most important achievements of the 20th century. It cannot be preserved if the United States does not continue to participate in those institutions.

The Biden administration’s continuation of Trump-era restrictions on trade with China, and its imposition of a host of new restrictions, is also a dubious strategy. Limiting competition is likely to yield some short-term benefits, but American economic growth in recent decades has been driven primarily by increased productivity in sectors that are exposed to global trade. Competition has been both painful and beneficial. The value of the major investments the federal government is making in infrastructure, research and technical education is significantly reduced by measures that limit the size of the market for American goods or that shelter American businesses from healthy foreign competition."

The future of many species hangs in the balance. Meet some of the animals most affected as humans convert more and more land:

WILDLIFE IS DISAPPEARING around the world, in the oceans and on land. The main cause on land is perhaps the most straightforward: Humans are taking over too much of the planet, erasing what was there before. Climate change and other pressures make survival harder.

Can we find a way to share the planet with the rest of its inhabitants?

Worldwide, most converted land is taken for agriculture, like clearing forests to graze cattle or to plant crops.

Each has seen at least a third of its natural environment vanish since 2001, research shows.

These are some of the vertebrates that have lost the most habitat in the last 20 years.

The groups of animals you just scrolled through aren’t the only species that have lost a third or more of their global habitat. They’re just some of the mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles researchers can currently track. Most live in tropical forests.

“If the forest disappears, they will disappear,” said Walter Jetz, a professor of biodiversity science at Yale University who leads Map of Life, a platform that combines satellite imaging with ecological data to determine how species ranges are changing around the world. Map of Life shared data with The New York Times.

Biodiversity, or all the variety of life on the planet — including plants, invertebrates and ocean species — is declining at rates unprecedented in human history, according to the leading intergovernmental scientific panel on the subject. The group’s projections suggest that a million species are threatened with extinction, many within decades.

Nations are meeting in Montreal to try to chart a different path. Delayed two years because of the pandemic, delegations are working to land a new, 10-year agreement to tackle biodiversity loss under a United Nations treaty called the Convention on Biological Diversity.

“With our bottomless appetite for unchecked and unequal economic growth, humanity has become a weapon of mass extinction,” said António Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, in his opening remarks on Tuesday in Montreal.

The last global biodiversity agreement failed to meet a single target at the global level, according to the Convention on Biological Diversity itself, and wildlife populations continue to plummet.

Take the Honduran white bat.

Researchers estimate the Honduran white bat has lost about half its habitat since 2001. Konrad Wothe/Alamy

At first glance, they resemble a cluster of cotton balls stuck under a leaf. But each tiny mound of fluff possesses an even tinier yellow snout and ears. Honduran white bats work together to fashion leaves into tent homes and are known to nurse each other’s young. At night, they fly out in search of a specific species of fig, dispersing its seeds in return.

These bats offer potential benefits to people. Their cuteness makes them an ecotourism draw, and they have an ability that’s rare in mammals to store carotenoids in their skin, which could hold promise for unlocking treatment for conditions like macular degeneration.

But in the last 20 years, Honduran white bats have lost about half their range in Central America as people clear rainforest for pasture, crops and homes. Not yet considered endangered, they are nevertheless in steep decline, one of countless examples in this worsening global crisis.

It’s not only wildlife that will suffer as a result. Biodiversity loss can trigger ecosystem collapse, scientists say, threatening humanity’s food and water supplies. Alarm is growing that the threat is comparable in significance to the climate crisis.

“Climate change presents a nearer-term threat to the future of human civilization,” said Katharine Hayhoe, a prominent climate change researcher who also focuses on biodiversity as chief scientist at the Nature Conservancy. “The biodiversity crisis presents a longer-term threat to the viability of the human species.”

Scientists emphasize that one can’t be solved without the other because they are interconnected.

This was the habitat of the Abah River flying frog in 2001. It lives in the forests of Malaysia and Indonesia, where it parachutes among the trees with its special webbed feet. By 2021 it had lost more than a third of its home, Map of Life researchers estimated.

What’s driving the loss?

The human population has doubled since 1970. While the rate of population growth is slowing, the sheer number of people continues to rise. Consumption levels in different parts of the world mean some people put more pressure on nature. In the United States, for example, each person uses the equivalent of eight global hectares on average, according to the Global Footprint Network, a nonprofit research group. In Nigeria, it’s about one hectare per person.

All that is related to the causes of biodiversity loss, which scientists have ranked. First are changes in land and sea use. Then comes the direct taking of species, for example hunting, fishing and wildlife trafficking. Climate change is next, followed by pollution and invasive species. Unfortunately for wildlife, these pressures build on each other.

The yellow cheeked gibbon has lost nearly 30 percent of its habitat in the last 20 years, according to Map of Life researchers. Alamy

In the future, scientists expect climate change to become the main driver of biodiversity loss as changes in temperature, rainfall and other conditions continue to transform ecosystems. That shift is expected “some decades down the road,” Dr. Jetz said. “But we might already be looking at a much-reduced set of species at that point.”

For the best chance at adapting to climate change, plants and animals need robust populations and room to migrate. Instead, they are depleted and hemmed in.

Why are people taking over so much land? Mostly for agriculture. In many parts of the world, that means exports driven by booming global trade. In recent decades, for example, Southeast Asia has become a major supplier of coffee, timber, rice, palm oil, rubber and fish to the rest of the world.

“All of that economic expansion has come at the cost of biodiverse habitat,” said Pamela McElwee, an environmental anthropologist at Rutgers University who studies the region.

Some momentum is building for companies to ensure their products are deforestation-free. Reducing meat consumption and food waste are key to freeing up land for other species, Dr. McElwee said.

In many places, poverty, powerful interests and a lack of law enforcement make habitat loss especially hard to address.

In 2001, this was the habitat of the shining honeycreeper, a bird with a range across Central America. It had lost more than a third of its home by last year, researchers estimated. Because of its large population, it’s still not considered threatened.

In Central America, illegal cattle ranching drives deforestation on protected state and Indigenous lands, said Jeremy Radachowsky, director for Mesoamerica and the Caribbean at the Wildlife Conservation Society. Wealthy individuals, often affiliated with drug cartels, grab land, sometimes through illegal payments. They raise beef, some of which ends up in the United States, he said.

Elsewhere in the region and beyond, desperation sometimes pushes people to find remote areas with little government presence where they can simply take land to make a living.

“They need land in order to feed their families,” said David López-Carr, a professor of geography at the University of California Santa Barbara who studies how people interact with tropical forests in Latin America.

Rainforest countries like Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo are known for widespread deforestation. But the species that have lost the largest portions of their habitats tend to be concentrated in places that are geographically isolated in some way, like the isthmus of Central America and Madagascar. Because animals there often have smaller ranges to begin with, habitat loss hits them especially hard.

For example, 98 percent of lemurs, primates that only exist in Madagascar, are threatened. Almost a third are on the brink of extinction. “I don’t want to lose my hope,” said Jonah Ratsimbazafy, a primatologist who leads a nonprofit group on the island that seeks to save lemurs while helping people. Madagascar is among the poorest countries in the world.

Recognition is growing that stanching biodiversity loss requires addressing the needs of local communities.

“There needs to be a way that the people that live close to the forests benefit from the intact forests, rather than clearing the forest for short term gain,” said Julia Patricia Gordon Jones, a professor of conservation science at Bangor University in Wales. “That’s the ultimate challenge of forest conservation globally.”

This is the 2001 habitat of the white fronted brown lemur, a primate that eats fruit and flowers. Over the last 20 years, it has lost around 40 percent of its habitat, Map of Life researchers estimated. People also hunt these lemurs for meat and they are now threatened with extinction.

A decisive moment in Montreal

While countries in the global south are experiencing the most dramatic biodiversity losses right now, Europe and the United States went through their own severe declines hundreds of years ago.

“We lost pretty much 100 percent of primary forest in most parts of Europe,” Dr. Jetz said.

Now, with negotiations underway in Montreal, countries that are poor economically but rich in biodiversity argue that they need help from wealthier countries if they’re going to take a different route.

Overall, the financial need is daunting: hundreds of billions per year to help poorer countries develop and implement national biodiversity plans, which would include actions like creating protected areas, restoring degraded lands, reforming harmful agricultural, fishing and forestry practices; managing invasive species; and improving urban water quality.

On the other hand, failing to address biodiversity loss carries enormous financial risk. A report by the World Economic Forum found that $44 trillion of economic value generation is “moderately or highly dependent on nature and its services and is therefore exposed to nature loss.”

A vast source of funding could come from redirecting subsidies that presently support fossil fuels and harmful agricultural practices, said David Cooper, deputy executive secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity.

“Currently, most governments spend far more on subsidies that actually are destroying nature than they do on financing conservation,” Mr. Cooper said. “So, certainly a change in that will be critical.”

The United States is the only country besides the Holy See that isn’t a party to the convention, so although the United States will attend the meeting, it will be participating from the sidelines.

“We can play a very constructive role from the outside,” said Monica Medina, an assistant secretary of state who is also special envoy for biodiversity and water resources. But she acknowledged that being a member would be better. “I hope that someday we will be,” she said.

Of the many targets being negotiated, the one that has gotten the most attention seeks to address habitat loss head on. Known as 30x30, it’s a plan to safeguard at least 30 percent of the planet’s land and oceans by 2030. More than 100 countries back the proposal. While some Indigenous groups fear it will lead to their displacement, others support the plan as a means to secure stronger land rights.

But experts emphasize that action will have to go further than lines on a map.

Brian Eno has been involved in so many varied and significant musical adventures that to call him a Zelig-like figure — which is often done — is to risk understating his reach and importance. The English musician and ideas man helped birth glam and art rock as a member of Roxy Music. He had a strong hand in iconic works by David Bowie, Talking Heads, U2 and Coldplay. Across a series of his own influential albums he pretty much invented ambient music. Eno’s clutch of nonambient solo albums are by turns nervy, catchy, enigmatic and moving. And so he has gone, fruitfully hither and yon, up to his latest, this fall’s “FOREVERANDEVERNOMORE.” (Listening to the album, with its musical evocations of technological decay and natural resilience, while my commuter train rumbles through swampy New Jersey industrial blight has often turned my usual emotionally inert trip to the office into a roller coaster of despair and acceptance.) Oh, and Eno, who is 74, has also led a parallel career as a roving music theorist-slash-public intellectual, one with a newly urgent focus. “I’m thinking about what most other people are thinking about now,” Eno says, “which is climate change and the threat of the collapse of civilization, which seems to get a year closer every two months.”

I know that over the years you’ve asked yourself, in a self-critical way, whether your work is really worth doing. But now, at your age, the bulk of the work is done. Your time has mostly been spent. Knowing that, do you feel like your answer to that question — which is the question of how you’ve lived your life — has been satisfactory? I think I’m still answering it. I’m still working on it. I’ve wanted to write a book for a long time: Why does art exist? Why do we have aesthetic preferences? There are all sorts of ways of explaining this. Some of them are biological: We like things that are red because it’s the same color as blood and sex organs and that sort of thing. But there are much more interesting ways of saying what the role of art is in the maintenance of a society. I don’t want to die before I get that done. [Laughs.] What I want to say is that culture — art, if you like — has an important set of functions in preparing us for the future. If you read a book like “1984,” you’re surrendering to a world with certain values and attributes and seeing what it feels like. Then, when you see something a bit like that starting to exist, you have a way of understanding it and how that might feel.

I get how what you’re saying makes sense for a novel like “1984,” but how does it make sense for art forms like nonnarrative music, which you make, or abstract paintings? That’s the most interesting question you could have asked. I’m absolutely fascinated by this question, because I think I have an answer, and I don’t think it has ever been well answered. What happens when you go look at a painting you’ve never seen before? What I think happens is that when you look at that picture, you’re seeing it in the context of all the other pictures you’ve ever seen. When you go and look at something new, what you’re saying is, “What’s different about this experience?” In many instances, there won’t be anything different, in which case you’re not that interested. But if you can look at it and say, “That’s more angular. That’s fuzzier. That’s much more this, much more that” — we’re very good at understanding differences in feeling within our own long narrative of looking at pieces of work. But what does it mean, for example, when a picture is scratchier than another? You read that as, This is urgent. The artist didn’t have time to make it pretty. We read messages that don’t have a text quality to them, and we still pick up on the ideas that make them different. Or take Bauhaus. When Bauhaus comes along, it’s saying, “We no longer think of the world as divided into beautiful things and functional things.” That’s a philosophical position about the world. Art, even when it’s nonnarrative, makes those kinds of points all the time.

You have ideas about how art does what it does. Do you also have ideas about what makes artists what they are? I’m thinking about something like charisma. What is it that makes some of the people you’ve worked with — Bryan Ferry or David Bowie or Bono or David Byrne — into stars? What accounts for that quality? That’s an interesting question. I think charisma comes out of the sense you have that not only is somebody different but they’re also confident about it, committed to it, obsessed by it even. We don’t find uncertainty charismatic. Uncertainty doesn’t work for anybody very well, because in general the media don’t appreciate people like that. I would like to cultivate a charisma of uncertainty, a charisma of admitting that you’re making it up as you go along. I remember this funny thing. One day when we were working on the Passengers album with U2 in Dublin, Pavarotti came into the studio because he was singing on one of those tracks. We’re in the main room saying, Should we put the chorus here, no, let’s double that section, da da da. Pavarotti’s standing in the control room watching what we’re doing. Then he says, “You are making it up!” I think it was the first time he realized that, at some point, music is made up!

As opposed to not just springing out fully formed? Exactly. It doesn’t come as a whole package and then you learn to sing it. I thought, If he was surprised by that, how much more would other people be surprised by this notion that things are born messily? They don’t come out with any charisma at all. They start out, they’ve got blood on them, you’ve got to clean them up, surround them with love and attention until they can stand on their own. Yeah, a charisma of uncertainty would be my thing. In a way, David Byrne has that. One of the attractions of his persona is that he’s not afraid to weave in confusion: “How did I get here?” I think he’s on a path to a kind of feasible future human. You can be amazing, but you could admit too that you’re bewildered.

Since we’re talking about how things work: How do you want your new album to work for people? I suppose I’m trying to make a space where people can rest their attention in one place for a while. One of the epidemics of now is the inability to focus or concentrate. I was watching someone at lunchtime today. She had a book and was on her earphones and on the phone. There could be a postmodern argument for saying that this is a new way of absorbing and collaging material together. I personally find that quite hard to do. I’m addicted to the idea that you put yourself in a place and surrender to it. It’s about making space for a kind of attention that you’re not normally offered by entertainment media. The other thing is that if you’re writing things, and they have words, and therefore suggest the possibility that they are about something, then what are they about? Although this isn’t an album about climate change, it’s an album made by someone aware of living in the era of climate change.

Along those lines, there’s beauty in your new album, but it’s also deeply sad. Is that an accurate reflection of how you’re feeling about the world? For me, some of the music is very blissful. The last track is an idea of a kind of future that I would like. Also the track called “We Let It In” is not pessimistic. There is a threat built into it — that low barking sound — but that’s because I can’t conceive of a future where there isn’t a threat. I think we’re in for a hard ride for maybe half a century. Then it will either be the end of civilization or a reborn humanity with a different set of ideas about who we are and where we belong and how we must relate to things in order to survive. So I see a pessimistic short-term future. Not short-term for the person who’s living it but short-term in the history of civilization. Then I see this point at which we either really fail or we start to succeed. I think the succeed side has a very good chance because of the amount of human intelligence at work. There has never been more intelligence on the planet than there is now. Not only because there’s more brains than ever but there are also more augmentations of brains. There are more connections among all these brains. We’re in a sort of intelligence explosion. I hope.

It doesn’t always seem like it. No, it certainly doesn’t. [Laughs.]

An idea that has gained traction lately is that we’re in a particularly boring period of popular culture. People have suggested certain structural reasons for that, having to do with, for example, an increased disinclination toward ambiguity. But what about you? Do you think we’re in a dull cultural moment? I don’t, actually. Right now I see quite strong movement in some rather unexpected areas. A.S.M.R., this whispering thing, that’s incredibly promising. It’s quite counterintuitive. You get the idea that the trajectory of media is greater acceleration, louder, more surprises, and here you have millions of people sitting listening to somebody brushing their hair and whispering for 40 minutes. You have to take that on board as being one of the things that’s happening in culture and quite different from the story that we’re generally hearing. LARPing, too. I don’t think many people take that as seriously as I do. It’s an extraordinary new art form. Quite alarmingly it seems to be developing into a political form as well. Live-action role playing is what we now call politics. So it has a downside as well.

Have you LARPed? I’ve done limited, party-game versions of it. I love those but I’ve never done it on a sort of proper scale.

Do you have a LARPing fantasy? Yes! Did you read Kim Stanley Robinson’s most recent book?

“The Ministry for the Future”? Yeah. That would be a great thing to do some LARPs from. I’d love to be the black-ops specialist in that book. I’m always interested in these nonconforming areas where a new story is being told.

You once wrote — this was almost 30 years ago — that you were frustrated by the available pornography. Is that still the case? No, no! Because it’s been democratized. You now have sites where people put up their own stuff, and it blows that Los Angeles pink stuff out of the water. The dominant colors of L.A. porn are pink and honey. It’s glossy, shallow, no shadows. You know the form called outsider art? It thrills me. That same attention of naïve artists has been turned to porn. There’s some incredible stuff coming out. It gives you faith in humanity. Jesus, there’s a lot of clever, passionate people out there.

Hey, is it really true that you peed on a Duchamp? Yes I did.

Really? No security guard saw you? No. In fact there was a security guard standing within two meters of me when I did it but he had his back to me. The way I did it was rather complicated. I noticed that this vitrine that the urinal was in had two pieces of glass about five millimeters apart — there was a tiny gap. So I went to a plumber’s near the Museum of Modern Art and I found some fine plastic tube that I knew I could get through it. I used that and a pipette. I went to the toilet and peed in the sink — God, they’d hate to know this. I pipetted it up, covered the end so it held the golden liquid in there, and then stood by the vitrine and was feeding the pipe through. I mean, it was symbolic in a way because it was a tiny amount of pee.

You weren’t worried about damaging the priceless art? No. I didn’t think my urine was that acidic.

Maybe this is semi-related: Smell anything good recently? Two things. One is a neroli, a bitter orange blossom. Somebody made a version that’s got limonene, citronella and something called hydroxycitronellal. It’s the best-smelling neroli I’ve ever smelled. The other one is a smell I’ve known about for a while but I’m getting back into. It’s called karanal. It makes you think of ozone. You know when you click a stone and a piece of metal together and there’s that smell? I send away for these things and they come back and I sit and smell them. I’m filling out in my head the map of smells. Triplal is another beautiful one. I love it.

I wanted to ask you this: Almost all recorded music now is ambient music, in that it’s used as background while we do other stuff. But it doesn’t quite feel like musicians are responding to that reality in any especially interesting ways, at least as far as I know. Is there more that musicians could be doing there? There’s certainly more to be done. The whole point of ambient music was to say, look, it’s not as if people were going to sit down in front of their speakers and focus. Even in 1978 that wasn’t what people were doing. People wanted more consistent, longer-lasting moods. They didn’t want what albums were offering, which was a dance song, a ballad, another loud song and then a quiet song — that idea that you’d get bored with something that didn’t have a lot of changes. But every way of listening produces a new music. What I’ve become interested in is listening clubs, where people get together and listen to a record. This strikes me as a very interesting development. There are strong signs that people are resisting the atomization of everything. It’s suited capitalism to have us all as separate as possible because then we have to all buy things individually. People are getting fed up with that and wanting to do things together. One of the things they’re wanting to do is to start tackling climate change. I think this is the biggest movement in human history, but it’s hardly noticed by the media. There are millions of people involved in some way working on climate change. This huge movement is starting to coalesce.

You’re obviously interested in how the world might change or be made to change. I’m curious about what you think of the idea of “disruption,” which is a word that the tech world has basically ruined. It depends how it’s used. For people like Steve Bannon, destruction is their main tool. That famous statement he said: “Flood the zone with [expletive].” This is more and more what populists do. They think, OK, if we can create chaos, we know how to benefit. Because in chaos people retreat to those who look like they’re certain. The thing that populists project is: We all know what’s going on, don’t we? Too many immigrants or Jews or liberals. This is why I talk about the climate movement, because that’s anti-chaos. That’s a knitting-together of people. It’s just starting to show a few green shoots, but underneath the ground there’s this constant thickening. I went to a conference the other day in Barcelona, and there were, I don’t know, 500 people. There are 20 whom I’ll probably have further conversations with. I thought, How many conferences of that scale were going on that weekend? Probably worldwide it would have been maybe 150. If everybody in those conferences was making roughly the same number of connections — I get this picture of this movement becoming powerful. You start to think, We’re all doing it. It’s not the David and Goliath situation we’d thought it was because, actually, we’re Goliath. We’re not David.

Insofar as you have a public image, it’s as an extremely cerebral figure. But even just in this conversation it’s clear that emotions and feelings drive a lot of what you do. So what’s an emotion or feeling driving you right now? I can give you a clear example. I recently found this gospel song on YouTube. Donald Vails is playing piano on it. Billy Preston is playing organ. They’re in a room with a mixed bunch of people with quite a range of ages. They sing this song, “You Can’t Beat God Giving.” It’s a great song, but what’s fantastic is seeing these people singing to one another. It’s intensely moving. Billy Preston is sort of sitting in as a star, but the rest of the people, I would assume, have normal jobs and normal lives, and they’re elevated by this community they’ve formed around this event. That, more and more, is the feeling that I’m fascinated by: What happens to humans when they multiply their feelings together? We’ve been so atomized over the last 50, 100 years and told that we have to have our own completely independent lives and that the real human is the one who can stand alone. The real human, to me, seems like the one who can support his neighbors and work with them. That’s a feeling that I pursue. Whenever I see it, I want to encourage it.

Now he returns to office on Saturday, in a prearranged power-sharing deal, with that initial optimism dissipated, and with question marks over his judgment and leadership style.

Mr. Varadkar, who trained as a doctor, was one of Europe’s youngest heads of government when he took over from Enda Kenny, then his party’s leader, who had become embroiled in a police whistle-blowing scandal. At the time, many Irish commentators viewed him as a breath of fresh air. He “comes across to the public, especially younger voters, as if he is not a politician at all,” the political columnist Stephen Collins wrote in The Irish Times in 2017.

“In this anti-politician phase of Western democracy,” Mr. Collins added, “that is a crucial asset.”

Much was expected of Mr. Varadkar as he climbed the ranks. The son of an immigrant — his father, who is also a doctor, is from Mumbai; his mother is an Irish nurse — Mr. Varadkar announced that he was gay in 2015 while serving as health minister. That statement, during a referendum about legalizing gay marriage, was cited by some as having contributed to the measure’s approval."

Mr. Knight is among those who believe that overpopulation is a main factor in the climate crisis, but that idea can be fraught. Poor countries that are heavily populated, such as India, contribute relatively little per capita to the greenhouse gas emissions that are heating the planet. Wealthy countries with relatively smaller populations like the United States are generating most of the pollution that is driving global warming.

“The problem that is spiraling out of control is consumption,” said John Wilmoth, director of the United Nations’ population division, who says that focusing on population limitation as a potential climate fix diverts attention from the urgent need for everyone to ditch fossil fuels and more efficiently use resources. “We have to transform the economic incentives that make it possible to profit off of polluting the environment.”

The idea that population must be controlled has also led to forced sterilizations and measures that have proven inhumane or have been linked to racist theories like eugenics.

Yet Stephanie Feldstein, director of population and sustainability at the Center for Biological Diversity, said while greater human longevity and health were good things, they have come at a cost to other living things on the planet."

Developing countries face irreversible damage from climate change but have done little to cause the crisis. And they are demanding compensation from the parties they see as responsible: wealthier nations that have emitted half of all heat-trapping gases since 1850 and created pollution that is dangerously heating the planet.

This debate will be front and center this week at the 27th annual U.N. climate talks, known as COP27, which opened yesterday in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt. Simon Stiell, the U.N. climate chief, said the decision to include the issue on the agenda “bodes well” for a compromise by the end of the summit.

But political will is limited. The U.S. and the E.U. fear that such compensation could become an unlimited liability. Last year, wealthy nations vowed to provide $40 billion per year by 2025 to help poorer countries with adaptation. A U.N. report estimates that this amount is less than one-fifth of what developing nations need, fueling calls for separate funding to deal with the aftermath of climate disasters.

In a chapter on the environment, the expansive role of nurses in the battle against climate change is addressed: from evacuating babies to researching heat-related kidney failure in agricultural workers to advocating for school policy that mitigates asthma rates. “Nurses are not always understood as crucial to climate change response, but they should be, because they are uniquely situated to respond.”

In the area of addiction, nurses trailblaze harm reduction clinics where people can safely inject heroin. We meet L. Synn Stern, a registered nurse who runs an overdose prevention center in New York. Here, she trains “harm reduction specialists,” including Mezon, whose role DiGregorio describes unflinchingly: how to inject, to use a tourniquet, avoid the burn of hitting an artery. And then, in a subtle takedown of the pharmaceutical industry responsible for the legacy of oxycodone, Mezon can also “show someone how to use a fentanyl test to make sure the heroin is not cut with the more potent drug.”

DiGregorio’s storytelling is pitch-perfect; narrative and nursing, she understands, come from the same place and both are concerned with a deep understanding of character and plot. We meet Cicely Saunders, who founded St. Christopher’s Hospice in 1947, as she cares for a 40-year-old man dying of cancer. “His pain — physical, existential, emotional — changed the course of Saunders’s life and of history,” DiGregorio writes. “Their intimacy gave her an understanding of what she would come to call ‘total pain,’ a combination of the physical symptoms, mental distress, social problems and spiritual needs that come with dying.”

DiGregorio doesn’t explicitly state that we might extend Saunders’s term to include the circumstances so rampant in our moment: mental illness, violence, poverty and loneliness. For too many people now, simply living is painful.

“Taking Care” never shouts. It doesn’t need to. But there is quiet anger on every page, especially in the wake of political shifts that render caregiving harder than ever. “With Roe now overturned, abortion criminalized in some states, and other privacy-based rights in jeopardy, reproductive care in the United States is more threatened than usual. And nurses and midwives are, again and always, stepping into that breach.” We are reminded that advocacy and activism are key functions of modern-day nursing."

Trump.

In place of Mr. Trump’s belittling comments about Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his trade threats, the conversation between the two leaders on Friday turned repeatedly to the close ties between their two countries and to the announcement of agreements on several key issues, including migration, clean energy and protecting the Arctic.

The two leaders also condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and pledged to confront China’s expanding influence.

“Our destinies are intertwined,” Mr. Biden said in an address to Parliament that was frequently interrupted by applause, “not because of inevitability of geography, but because it’s a choice — a choice we made again and again. The United States chooses to link our future with Canada because we know that we’ll find no better partner.”"

The tenor of these quiet flatlands, where deer bounce across gravel roads and neon sunsets scream across the long horizon, would change dramatically if mining for metals like niobium, scandium, titanium and rare earths begins.

But many people here think Southeast Nebraska, dotted with dying downtowns and aging residents, could play a small part in helping to solve a full-blown geopolitical crisis that Doc Evans, a Johnson County commissioner, summed up like this: “The trouble with China.”

Mr. Evans and numerous others welcome the digging that a company called NioCorp wants to begin because they feel it’s their patriotic duty.

That could have deadly results. Tropical fish live in complex environments and they’re constantly faced with decisions: What to eat, whom to fight, where to go. Surrounded by predators, every move could mean life or death.

“Cognitive ability in fishes is very important for their survival,” said Ana Carolina Luchiari, a fish biologist at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte in Natal, Brazil, and an author of the study, which was published this month in the journal PeerJ.

A lot has been done to understand how heat can kill fish, Dr. Luchiari said. But there’s relatively little research on how heat affects learning and memory in tropical fish that manage to survive high temperatures."

The two men will move in different orbits: Mr. Sunak jetting in for a day to meet other world leaders; Mr. Johnson giving interviews and making the rounds as a celebrity attendee.

Still, it is a harbinger of the kind of disturbance Mr. Johnson may continue to cause in Mr. Sunak’s political weather system: popping up unexpectedly, grabbing attention, disrupting his successor’s plans and serving as a reminder of a time when Britain’s political chatter was dominated by illicit parties at Downing Street rather than a painful cost-of-living crisis."

But the agency estimates that the economic benefit, calculated in lives saved, illnesses averted and missed workdays prevented, would outweigh those costs by a range of $8 billion to $43 billion over the same time.

The draft rule proposes lowering the particulate matter standard from a limit of 12 micrograms per cubic meter to a level between 9 and 10 micrograms per cubic meter. The E.P.A. will accept public comments on the proposed rule for 60 days. Agency officials said that, based on those comments, they could still tighten or loosen the initial proposal before finalizing it, most likely later this year.

Some environmental justice advocates said the proposal did not go far enough to protect vulnerable communities. “This rule falls short of taking steps to mitigate the decades of neglect and harm done to the health of our communities and to the health of Latino children in particular,” said Laura M. Esquivel, vice president of federal policy at the Hispanic Federation. “We will continue to advocate for the Biden administration to do more to ensure Latino communities are not left at risk.”

The proposed rule is the latest in a series of actions by the Biden administration to restore and expand environmental protections that were rolled back, weakened or ignored under President Donald J. Trump. After the November midterms, Mr. Biden now faces two years of a divided Congress, with few prospects for significant legislation over the next two years. That leaves him to lean into the power of his executive authority.

In 2021, the E.P.A. restored Obama-era rules on climate-warming auto pollution that had been rolled back under Mr. Trump, and it is expected to further tighten those rules later this year. Also this year, agency officials plan to complete a new regulation on leaks of methane, a powerful planet-warming gas that seeps from oil and gas wells, and to enact a new rule to rein in carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, after the Trump administration had weakened and rolled back rules on those pollutants."

And the benefits of this once-in-a-lifetime winter are everywhere. Melting snow that continues to fill reservoirs will allow the state to fill 100 percent of water requests for the first time in nearly two decades. That means that 27 million Californians and 750,000 acres of farmland that have been allocated only some or, in some cases, none of their requested water will now have all of it, according to the California Department of Water Resources. It’s the first time since 2006 that this has been possible.

Even with the spring snowmelt, much of the snowpack is expected to last into July or, in some instances, even into August or September, which will help keep Sierra Nevada forests moist and the fire danger lower. Rivers are rising and, while a bit too intense at times, will make for great rafting, kayaking and fishing. For those who don’t want to leave winter behind, several ski resorts are staying open well into the summer. Pockets of flooding have left some stranded and many buildings damaged, but the likelihood of severe events is decreasing as each day passes with normal melt conditions.

Of course, our water woes are not over. The long-term drying of the Southwest continues, and precipitation patterns are shifting in a changing climate. Eventually drought will return — likely sooner than later — and we need to continue developing solutions to low precipitation years.

But this year still feels like a reward. Rather than solely prepare for the upcoming natural disaster season of fire and drought, we get to anticipate a summer when flowing rivers and deep lakes will be full of people enjoying them. If only for one year, abundant, clear and cold waters will come down from the Sierra Nevada. It’s a breath of fresh air after seemingly endless bad news about water, climate and natural disasters in the West, one to celebrate."

Friendless except for three siblings, a family dog and a maid, he grew up lonely and dyslexic in an emotionally distant household. He was sent to a private boarding school at 12 and rarely heard from his parents.

With patience, counseling and intense struggles for self-improvement, he overcame his reading disabilities. He studied Latin and Greek at Groton and mastered mathematics at Yale, meteorology in the Army Air Forces during World War II, and physics under Clarence Zener, Edward Teller and Enrico Fermi at the University of Chicago, where he earned a doctorate in 1952.

At M.I.T.’s Lincoln Laboratory in the 1950s and ’60s, he was a member of teams that helped lay the groundwork for random access memory (RAM) in computers and developed plans for the nation’s first air defense system. In 1976, as federal funding for his M.I.T. work ended, he moved to Oxford to teach and manage a chemistry lab, where he began his research on batteries.

Essentially, a battery is a device that makes electrically charged atoms, known as ions, move from one side to another, creating an electrical current that powers anything hooked up to the battery. The two sides, called electrodes, hold charges — a negative one called an anode, and a positive one called a cathode. The medium between them, through which the ions travel, is an electrolyte.

When a battery releases energy, positively charged ions shuttle from the anode to the cathode, creating a current. A rechargeable battery is plugged into a socket to draw electricity, forcing the ions to shuttle back to the anode, where they are stored until needed again. Materials used for the anode, cathode and electrolyte determine the quantity and speed of the ions, and thus the battery’s power."

Early in my career, I became fascinated by the tropics; the struggle to exist in steamy, often hostile environments resulted in captivating civilizations. Only much later did I become interested in the frozen far north, whose equally challenging conditions have pushed people to extraordinary lengths. I wasn’t alone: people are more interested in heat than cold. Scientists studied the origin and possibilities of heat long before turning their attention to lower temperatures. Until the late Middle Ages, many scholars believed that an island called Thule was the source of all cold. And to this day, there exist far more books about the nature of fire, its origin and history and impact on civilization, than about its frozen counterpart.

Contrary to its subtitle, Fred Hogge’s “Of Ice and Men” is neither the definitive history nor the epic saga of ice. But the Steinbeckian pun of a title itself does tells us what to expect: This book is funny and quirky and full of well-told stories and irreverent asides. Hogge wants us to have a good time, and he seems to be having one himself.

The story of ice and men begins with the ancient Sumerians. The first known civilization to have developed a written language, the Sumerians were, as a result, the earliest documented — and thus the first (or first recorded) — to have achieved many human milestones. Hogge credits them with building both the first city and the first ice pits, a remarkable achievement in what is now a hot, dry desert climate.

Hogge, a gifted storyteller, brings this and many other subjects to cinematic life. Sometimes, rather too literally. The 1986 movie “The Mosquito Coast” is, at least, about an ice machine. But the frequent film references can be baffling; does “Apocalypse Now” really inform us about early Arctic exploration? Hogge has a tendency to treat films as historic documents; the discovery of cannibalism on the whale ship Essex is not attributed to the historian Nathaniel Philbrick, who wrote “In the Heart of the Sea,” but rather to the director of its adaptation, Ron Howard. What do we glean from Hogge’s well-spun account of the development of refrigeration from the fact that Frank Sinatra compared Grace Kelly to a Frigidaire in “High Society”? Unclear. Sometimes you feel he would have preferred just writing a book about his favorite film moments. (“Takes of Wrath”?)"

What Happens Next? The global human population has been climbing for the past two centuries. But what is normal for all of us alive today — growing up while the world is growing rapidly — may be a blip in human history.Children born today will very likely live to see the end of global population growth. A baby born this year will be 60 in the 2080s, when demographers at the U.N. expect the size of humanity to peak. The Wittgenstein Center for Demography and Global Human Capital in Vienna places the peak in the 2070s. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington puts it in the 2060s. All of the predictions agree on one thing: We peak soon. And then we shrink. Humanity will not reach a plateau and then stabilize. It will begin an unprecedented decline. Because most demographers look ahead only to 2100, there is no consensus on exactly how quickly populations will fall after that. Over the past 100 years, the global population quadrupled, from two billion to eight billion. As long as life continues as it has — with people choosing smaller family sizes, as is now common in most of the world — then in the 22nd or 23rd century, our decline could be just as steep as our rise.

Dr. Spears is an economist at the Population Research Center at the University of Texas, Austin.

Most people now live in countries where two or fewer children are born for every two adults. If all people in the United States today lived through their reproductive years and had babies at an average pace, then it would add up to about 1.66 births per woman. In Europe, that number is 1.5; in East Asia, 1.2; in Latin America, 1.9. Any worldwide average of fewer than two children per two adults means our population shrinks and in the long run each new generation is smaller than the one before. If the world’s fertility rate were the same as in the United States today, then the global population would fall from a peak of around 10 billion to less than two billion about 300 years later, over perhaps 10 generations. And if family sizes remained small, we would continue declining.

What would happen as a consequence? Over the past 200 years, humanity’s population growth has gone hand in hand with profound advances in living standards and health: longer lives, healthier children, better education, shorter workweeks and many more improvements. Our period of progress began recently, bringing the discovery of antibiotics, the invention of electric lightbulbs, video calls with Grandma and the possibility of eradicating Guinea worm disease. In this short period, humanity has been large and growing. Economists who study growth and progress don’t think this is a coincidence. Innovations and discoveries are made by people. In a world with fewer people in it, the loss of so much human potential may threaten humanity’s continued path toward better lives.

Whenever low birthrates get public attention, chances are somebody is concerned about what it means for international competition, immigration or a government’s fiscal challenges over the coming decades as the population ages. But that’s thinking too small. A depopulating world is a big change that we all face together. It’s bigger than geopolitical advantage or government budgets. It’s much bigger than nationalistic worries over which country or culture might manage to eke out a population decline that’s a little bit slower than its neighbors’.

Fewer and fewer countries have high birthrates Total fertility rates and populations for countries with at least one million people. Population 1 billion 100 million 100,000 Total fertility rate 6 5 4 3 2 1 The total fertility rate is the number of births a woman would have if she followed the average patterns of births in her country during her lifetime. Over the past two centuries, birthrates have fallen everywhere. Africa is the only higher-fertility region remaining. A rate of about 2.1 is known as replacement fertility because the population would stabilize if every two people had two children (plus additional births to account for childhood deaths and imbalances in sex at birth). Most people now live in places with below-replacement fertility. Europe crossed the threshold in 1975, China in the early 1990s, Brazil in the early 2000s. India crossed below 2 in its most recent population survey. REPLACEMENT

FERTILITY Source: U.N. World Population Prospects 2022

Sustained below-replacement fertility will mean tens of billions of lives not lived over the next few centuries — many lives that could have been wonderful for the people who would have lived them and by your standards, too.

Perhaps that loss doesn’t trouble you. It would be tempting to welcome depopulation as a boon to the environment. But the pace of depopulation will be too slow for our most pressing problems. It will not replace the need for urgent action on climate, land use, biodiversity, pollution and other environmental challenges. If the population hits around 10 billion people in the 2080s and then begins to decline, it might still exceed today’s eight billion after 2100. Population decline would come quickly, measured in generations, and yet arrive far too slowly to be more than a sideshow in the effort to save the planet. Work to decarbonize our economies and reform our land use and food systems must accelerate in this decade and the next, not start in the next century.

This isn’t a call to immediately remake our societies and economies in the service of birthrates. It’s a call to start conversations now, so that our response to low birthrates is a decision that is made with the best ideas from all of us. Kicking the can down the road will make choices more difficult for future generations. The economics and politics of a society in which the old outnumber the young will make it even harder to choose policies that support children.

If we wait, the less inclusive, less compassionate, less calm elements within our society and many societies worldwide may someday call depopulation a crisis and exploit it to suit their agendas — of inequality, nationalism, exclusion or control. Paying attention now would create an opportunity to lay out a path that would preserve freedom, share burdens, advance gender equity, value care work and avoid the disasters that happen when governments try to impose their will on reproduction.

Or perhaps we don’t need to concern ourselves at all if fertility rates self-correct to two. But the data shows that they don’t. Births won’t automatically rebound just because it would be convenient for advancing living standards or sharing the burden of care work or financing social insurance programs. We know that fertility rates can stay below replacement because they have. They’ve been below that level in Brazil and Chile for about 20 years; in Thailand for about 30 years; and in Canada, Germany and Japan for about 50.

In fact, in none of the countries where lifelong fertility rates have fallen well below two have they ever returned above it. Depopulation could continue, generation after generation, as long as people look around and decide that small families work best for them, some having no children, some having three or four and many having one or two.

Nor can humanity count on any one region or subgroup to buoy us all over the long run. Birthrates are falling in sub-Saharan Africa, the region with the current highest average rates, as education and economic opportunities continue to improve. Israel is an example of a rich country that, as of today, has above-replacement fertility rates. But there, too, fertility rates have been falling over the decades, from 4.5 in 1950 to 3.0 today. Israel may not be above 2.1 for many more generations.

As living standards increased, birthrates fell Total fertility rates and G.D.P. per capita for countries with at least one million people. $1,000 $10,000 G.D.P. per capita $100,000 1 2 3 4 5 6 Total fertility rate 7 1991 2021 1991 2021 Sources: U.N. World Population Prospects 2022, World Bank

The main reason that birthrates are low is simple: People today want smaller families than people did in the past. That’s true in different cultures and economies around the world. It’s what both women and men report in surveys.

Humanity is building a better, freer world with more opportunities for everyone, especially for women. That progress deserves everyone’s greatest celebration — and everyone’s continued efforts. That progress also means that, for many of us, the desire to build a family can clash with other important goals, including having a career, pursuing projects and maintaining relationships. No society has solved this yet. These tradeoffs bite deep for parents everywhere. For some parents, that means struggle. For others, that means smaller families than they hoped for. And for too many, it means both.

In a world of sustained low birthrates and declining populations, there may be threats of backsliding on reproductive freedom — by limiting abortion rights, for example. Some will inexcusably claim that restricting reproductive choice is a way to curb long-run population decline. Some already do.

No. Low birthrates are no reason to reverse progress toward a more free, diverse and equal world. Restricting reproductive rights — by denying access to critical health care and by denying the basic freedom to choose to parent or not to parent — would harm many people and for that reason would be wrong whether or not depopulation is coming. And it would not prevent the population from shrinking. We know that because fertility rates are below two both where abortion is freely available and where abortion is restricted. Any policymaker asking how to respond to global depopulation should start by asking what people want and how to help them achieve it rather than by asking what they might take away.

There are many ways to live a life or be a family, and having that freedom and diversity is good. If an inclusive, compassionate response to population decline emerges someday, it need not be in conflict with those values. If one in every four pairs of American adults would choose to have one more child, that would be enough to stabilize the U.S. population. In that future, there would still be many ways to live a life or be a family; two kids on average doesn’t mean two kids for everyone.

Nobody yet knows what to do about global depopulation. But it wasn’t long ago that nobody knew what to do about climate change. These shared challenges have much in common, which gives humanity some shared experience to build on.

As with climate change, our individual decisions on family size add up to an outcome that we all share. No people are making mistakes when they choose not to have children or to have small families. (Although we might all be making a mistake, together, when instead of taking care of one another, we make it hard for people to choose larger families.) It’s in no one’s hands to change global population trajectories alone. Not yours, whatever you choose for your life, not one country’s, not one generation’s. Nor is it in your hands personally to end all carbon emissions even by ending your own emissions. And yet our personal choices add up to big implications for humanity as a whole.

It’s not too early to take depopulation seriously. The New York Times reported on the threat of climate change in 1956. A scientist testified about it before Congress in 1957. In 1965 the White House released a report calling carbon dioxide a pollutant, warning of a warming world with melting ice caps and rising sea levels. That was nearly six decades ago.

Six decades from now is when the U.N. projects the size of the world population will peak. There won’t be any quick fixes: Even if it’s too early today to know exactly how to build an abundant future that offers good lives to a stable, large and flourishing future population, we should already be working toward that goal. Waiting until the population peaks to ask how to respond to depopulation would be as imprudent as waiting until the world starts to run out of fossil fuels to begin responding to climate change.

Humanity needs a compassionate, factual and fair conversation about how to respond to depopulation and how to share the burdens of creating each future generation. The way to have that conversation is to start paying attention now."

In other words, California is still experiencing the impacts of climate change and generally getting hotter, even if this summer doesn’t turn out to set many records for scorching weather across the state, experts say.

The records that have been set this year have generally been concentrated in the interior of the state. In July, the California cities where daily high temperature records were broken included Anaheim, Sacramento, Redding, Merced and Palm Springs. On Thursday, Lancaster set a record high of 108 degrees.

Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, and China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, began talks in Moscow yesterday with boasts of their close ties and only understated mention of the conflict in Ukraine. The leaders went to great lengths to flatter each other and project unity in a series of meticulously choreographed events.

Xi is the highest-profile world leader to visit Russia since its invasion of Ukraine over a year ago. He arrived for the three-day visit as bloody battles continued in eastern Ukraine and only three days after Putin was cited for war crimes by the International Criminal Court. Though the war and its effects hung over the meeting, the two leaders made few public comments about it.

Their imagery of alliance has stoked anxiety in the West, which fears that China might go beyond just diplomacy or economics in supporting Russia and offer it weapons to use in Ukraine. There also are concerns the two countries may entrench a powerful bloc to counter NATO and the U.S.

Analysis: Behind the display of friendship was a backdrop of hardheaded geopolitics. China and Russia both oppose a global order dominated by the U.S. and its allies, and that appears to outweigh any objections that Xi may have about Putin’s invasion of Ukraine."

Despite decades of haranguing, Americans are still terrible at recycling. And the reasons people waste food are much more complex than the reasons they throw water bottles in the wrong bin: They forget the spinach in the fridge and get more; they buy avocados that go bad before they get eaten; they cook a huge holiday spread to show love to friends and family and then can’t finish it all. As Dana Gunders, executive director of the nonprofit ReFED, points out, one-third of the food in this country goes unsold or uneaten — evidence of a culture that takes abundance for granted.

“Nobody wakes up wanting to waste food,” Ms. Gunders said. “It’s just that we’re not thinking about it. We’ve become really accustomed to it in our culture, and quite numb.”

As in most of the country, throwing food into the garbage in Ohio is perfectly legal. So, in an attempt to extend its landfill’s life span, the Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio, or SWACO, has had to try a different tactic: persuasion. While it is not the only agency in the country nudging people to waste less food, it is one of the few that has measured the effectiveness of its public awareness campaign. An early study shows promise, as does the fact that, in 2021, 51 percent of the region’s waste was diverted from the landfill through recycling and composting. It is a record for the agency and much better than the national diversion rate of 32 percent.

At the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, he built a Colombia program from scratch, taking advantage of a landmark peace agreement that expanded possibilities for biological expeditions, eco-tourism and the development of plant-based products. He published a world checklist of useful plants, a virtually boundless, searchable database of species that supply food, medicine, fiber and fuel, or help mitigate the effects of climate change.

“Science is there, of course, to investigate, to understand nature, but also to help us protect the planet and improve our quality of life,” he said on a recent tour of the New York Botanical Garden’s science facilities, which are clustered, away from main walkways, in the northernmost corner of its 250-acre campus. “What I need to do now is figure out how this institution can respond better to these challenges.”

Dr. Diazgranados’s offices are in the garden’s glass-walled plant research laboratory, nestled in an old-growth oak forest. Here, researchers draw on collections of resins, seeds and plants preserved in spirits or in silica powder, along with vast banks of DNA samples and plant chemicals. “There’s a big range of work going on in here,” he said. “From understanding fruit and seed evolution and adaptation of plants to marginal habitats, to the potential consequences of climate change, all the way to diversification in the neotropics.”

Steps away in the garden’s stately, vaultlike herbarium complex, glass doors swished open to reveal a staff delicately laboring to press, label and glue onto acid-free paper the fruits of botanical fieldwork; on this day, it was one scientist’s haul from Peru. Nearly eight million specimens are stored in the herbarium, among them the leaves of frailejones that Dr. Diazgranados collected as a young researcher; about 40,000 more arrive every year from scientists in the field or from other institutions. The bridge between the botanical garden as a public attraction and a research facility is its living collection, whose plants are routinely sampled to help answer questions in plant genetics, structure and evolution."

The main component of natural gas is methane, which many readers may know primarily as a potent greenhouse gas, responsible for about 30 percent of global warming since the Industrial Revolution. Methane leakage from gas stoves in American homes — more than 75 percent of which occurs when the stoves are off — has the same warming effect as the annual carbon dioxide emissions from 500,000 cars, a Stanford study found last year.

The combustion of methane also produces toxic nitrogen oxides, including nitrogen dioxide, a respiratory irritant that can cause breathing problems and that is subject to stringent outdoor air pollution controls under the Clean Air Act.

It’s another story for indoor air pollution, which is largely unregulated. Since at least the 1970s, researchers have been studying the negative health effects of gas stoves, which are the only major indoor gas appliance that isn’t required to be vented outside. Most recently, a December meta-analysis estimated that 12.7 percent of childhood asthma cases in the United States are attributable to gas stove use, comparable to the share of cases attributable to secondhand smoke exposure.

The validity of that particular finding has been questioned by the economist Emily Oster, among others, who believes the health risks of gas stoves are being overstated. Oster pointed out in her newsletter that some U.S. states with low gas stove ownership have higher childhood asthma rates than those with high gas stove ownership.

But what’s clear from multiple tests and studies is that gas stoves can easily raise the amount of nitrogen dioxide inside the home to levels that would be illegal outdoors. They can also release other air pollutants that are known or suspected to cause cancer, even when turned off."

But the Biden plan has fueled anger across Europe at a critical moment, as the United States tries to keep its Western allies aligned against Russia’s war in Ukraine. Crucial allies in that effort are increasingly accusing the United States of undercutting them at the expense of domestic priorities.

Those frustrations have clouded what had been a trans-Atlantic effort to starve President Vladimir V. Putin of oil revenues needed to fuel his war in Ukraine. A looming European ban on Russian oil prompted the Biden administration to push for a workaround that would allow critical supplies of it to continue flowing in order to prevent a spike in global oil prices. European officials reluctantly agreed earlier this year to embrace a U.S. plan that would impose a cap on how much Russia could earn for each barrel it sells.

Determining that price has divided the European Union, leaving the issue in limbo just days before the embargo is set to take effect.

Allies’ frustration with the United States has been building since this summer, when Mr. Biden signed two bills aimed at giving a leg up to American industry. The Inflation Reduction Act, a sprawling climate and energy law, offers incentives to support America’s electric vehicle industry and the CHIPS Act contains $52 billion in subsidies and tax credits for any global chip manufacturer that chooses to set up new operations or expand existing ones in the United States. In particular, European officials view the Inflation Reduction Act as putting their domestic companies at a disadvantage."

Which ones are merely aggravating, and which are absolutely intolerable? It’s up to you to choose what’s worse.

Roaches

As the most common New York City roommate who doesn’t pay rent, the cockroach has been a local pest for decades, if not centuries. A 1988 study claimed the city’s cockroach population might be declining — but years later, evidence from inside your apartment building says otherwise.

Spotted Lanternflies

A flashy invasive species that government officials have asked New Yorkers to murder on sight, the spotted lanternfly doesn’t bite humans, but it is very destructive to certain plants. And since it has an affinity for grapevines, it puts your glass of locally grown wine at risk.

Mystery Drips

There’s nothing quite like a random droplet of mystery liquid hitting an exposed shoulder to send a shudder down your spine. Summer’s drips and drops, combined with breezy ensembles, are a recipe for ick.

Torrential Rains

Summer showers have always been common. But thanks to climate change, New York City is now a subtropical environment, and storms are increasing in severity, bringing flash floods and destruction — and, at the very least, ruining beach and pool days.

Rats

Sharks

‘Hot Car’

Most of the time, subway cars provide exquisitely cool air, even when platforms are hot. But every now and then, you stumble on an old friend: the stifling “hot car.” Savvy riders know to avoid empty cars on an otherwise-full train — standing in air-conditioning beats sitting trapped in oppressive heat.

Wildfire Smoke

In early June, millions on the East Coast were exposed to the worst air quality on record as Canadian wildfire smoke drifted down into the area. Expect more Mars-like skies, and choking ash to come, thanks to the hotter temperatures and drier conditions created by climate change (the new normal!).

So, which is worse? Tap to select. WORSE Sweating in a ‘hot car’ WORSE Choking on hot wildfire smoke

Pigeons

The New York pigeon is also known as a rock dove, which explains why they love the city: hard, rocky surfaces everywhere. They’re a classic New York pest because in addition to flapping closely overhead, they like to leave their mark: on balconies, benches, cars, statues and, sometimes, you.

Aphids

This summer, clouds of tiny bugs appeared suddenly, making their way up New Yorkers’ nostrils and into their eyes. The aphids were technically harmless, but psychologically traumatizing; it was almost as if pigeons were microscopic and there were billions of them.

So, which is worse? Tap to select. WORSE A flock of pigeons WORSE A cloud of aphids

Helicopters

Summer sightseeing and Hamptons-visiting brings the eardrum-pummeling noise of helicopter blades, reverberating between buildings and ruining quiet moments in the park. Over the past few years, it’s gotten bad enough to spark proposed legislation banning the aircraft over the city.

Drones

The fact that it’s illegal to fly a drone in New York City doesn’t mean that YouTube and TikTok are not full of drone videos from rule-flouters. Serene summer days are often interrupted by the whining whir of a little machine hovering above, possibly filming you without your consent."

The vast majority of my reading is for author interviews on “All Things Considered.” So as I write this in January, I’m chipping away at a pile of titles with February and March publication dates: “The Exceptions,” by Kate Zernike, about a group of women scientists who fought for equality at M.I.T.; “Four Battlegrounds,” by Paul Scharre, about artificial intelligence and the future of war; “A Sun to Be Sewn,” a slim and brutal work of fiction by the Haitian poet Jean D’Amérique; and “The Great Displacement,” by Jake Bittle, about Americans forced to relocate by climate change. I usually keep more of a balance between fiction and nonfiction, but it varies.

I also have a few books on my bedside table that have sat there longer than I’d like to admit. All three are about the queer trailblazer Harry Hay: “The Trouble With Harry Hay,"" by Stuart Timmons; “Radically Gay,” a collection of Hay’s writings edited by Will Roscoe; and a play called “The Temperamentals,” by Jon Marans. I have already read them, but I hope that by sleeping near them every night I will finally make some headway on the Harry Hay project that I’ve been dreaming about creating for a few years now.

What’s the last great book you read?

Abraham Verghese’s next novel, “The Covenant of Water,"" is more than 700 pages, and even though it doesn’t come out until May, I devoured it more quickly than many books that were ahead of it in my queue. This points to the gift and the curse of my job. The gift: I get to talk to an author I admire about his brilliant work of literature! The curse: I have no time to go back and read any of Verghese’s previous books, much as I’d like to.

Are there any classic novels that you only recently read for the first time?

In compiling the roughly $1.7 trillion catchall spending package that will keep the government open through September, lawmakers inserted several new funding and legislative proposals to ensure their priorities and policies become law before the end of the year.

It includes funding that will guarantee the enactment of policies first authorized in bipartisan legislation approved earlier in this Congress, including money for innovation hubs established in the semiconductor manufacturing law and projects in the infrastructure law. The package also includes a round of earmarks, rebranded as community project funding, that allow lawmakers to redirect funds to specific projects in their states and districts.

Here is a look at some of the provisions that would go into effect if enacted.

Military spending is the big winner.

The Defense Department would see an extraordinary surge in spending when adding its regular 2023 fiscal year budget together with additional funds being allocated to help respond to the war in Ukraine."

Yesterday, scientists at the Department of Energy announced a breakthrough that could help make that sci-fi vision into reality. After decades of trying, scientists for the first time carried out a nuclear fusion reaction that produced more energy than went into it. Behind that technical description is a simple but important breakthrough: Humans can tap into the process that powers stars to produce energy on Earth.

“It’s a true scientific moment,” my colleague Kenneth Chang, who covers physics and other sciences, told me. “It lets you look forward and get hopeful about what’s possible.”

Why is this result such a big deal? As a clean source of energy, nuclear fusion could help replace polluting fossil fuels and overcome climate change. And if the remaining challenges — of which there are many — are figured out, nuclear fusion could produce more energy than today’s technologies are capable of."

In a report for the United Nations, scientists said Monday that China had largely eliminated rogue emissions of one of those chemicals, known as CFC-11.

Once widely used as a refrigerant and in foam insulation, CFC-11 was first synthesized a century ago. Along with similar chemicals, collectively called chlorofluorocarbons, CFC-11 destroys ozone, which blocks ultraviolet radiation from the sun that can cause skin cancer and otherwise harm people, plants and animals. Chlorofluorocarbons were banned under the Montreal Protocol, a landmark environmental agreement that took effect in 1989.

If countries continue to maintain the bans on chlorofluorocarbons and other chemicals, ozone levels between the polar regions should reach pre-1980 levels by 2040. Ozone holes, or regions of greater depletion that appear regularly near the South Pole and, less frequently, near the North Pole, should also recover, by 2045 in the Arctic and about 2066 in Antarctica."

But in places with high or even moderate disaster risk, the future savings on repairs or rebuilding are likely to be greater than the extra money spent to build in resilience features, Christopher told me.

“It’s possible to achieve a really significant degree of protection against disasters,” he said. “The toll doesn’t need to be nearly as high as it is.”

Most home buyers aren’t aware of how much these features may save them in the long run, or they are more worried about the initial price than they are about the cost of eventual repairs. So builders have shied away from adding features that buyers may not be willing to pay extra for.

But that picture could be shifting.

With insurers raising their rates or refusing to offer new coverage in California, homeowners may come to view resilient homes as a way to make their insurance more affordable, which could increase demand for the structures — and give homebuilders a way to market them, Christopher said. It’s also possible that building codes will get tougher over time and start to require at least some of these resilience technologies.

By focusing on China, the candidates can make detailed policy pronouncements and play up their credentials, yet avoid discussion of Russia or Ukraine, an increasingly divisive topic among Republicans.

All of the candidates have blasted President Biden’s attitude toward China. Mr. Biden has sought to stabilize relations after escalating espionage accusations inflamed tensions. But he has also tried to counter Beijing’s growing global influence with a multilateral approach, aiming to shore up economic and diplomatic ties with regional allies.

One of the Biden administration’s focal points has been targeting China’s semiconductor industry. The administration has enacted export controls and helped push the CHIPS and Science Act, a bipartisan law that provided billions of dollars toward fostering a homegrown semiconductor industry that could make America less dependent on foreign suppliers.

But even that bipartisan effort has come in for criticism. On Thursday, as Mr. Ramaswamy stood miles away from the site of a new Intel chip manufacturing complex that will be assisted by the CHIPS Act, he attacked the law for including provisions related to addressing climate change.

Jon Gray, the president and chief operating officer of Blackstone, an investment firm with about $950 billion in assets under management:

This should be a transition year, as inflation wanes and the Fed stops raising rates, but the impact of tight monetary policy weighs on both employment and growth. Fortunately, we don’t have the kind of financial excesses we did back in 2008, so the economic slowdown should not be as painful.

Michael Doyle, a retired Army reservist who served in Operation Desert Storm and the Gulf War:

As a veteran living in Hawaii and dedicated to serving our wounded vets (Wounded Warrior Project) and first responders (Sheep Dog Impact Assistance), my hope for 2023 is that after 19 years of war and years of attacks against our first responders, our society has compassion and doesn’t forget our heroes. Continue to support our heroes financially and emotionally to heal their wounds.

Claudia Sahm, an independent economic consultant who was previously a section chief at the Federal Reserve and a senior economist at the Council of Economic Advisers:

All year people from Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary, to Cardi B., a rap icon, told us we are either in a recession or headed toward one. I disagree; jobs are plentiful, and the unemployment rate is near its 50-year low. The reason we fear recessions is because millions of workers lose their jobs. In fact, historically, even a relatively small rise in unemployment tells us we are already in a recession and substantially more unemployment is on the way."

Ukraine dismissed all six of its deputy defense ministers yesterday, deepening the housecleaning at a ministry that had drawn criticism for corruption in procurement, as the military budget ballooned during the war. The government did not give a reason for the changes.

The move came as Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, headed to the U.S., where he will appeal to Western leaders for further aid for the war. He is scheduled to address the U.N. General Assembly in person in New York and to meet with President Biden and members of Congress in Washington later in the week.

In Ukraine’s fight to take back territory seized by Russia, the chain of command for battlefield decisions runs directly from Zelensky to the military’s uniformed general staff, largely bypassing the civilians at the defense ministry. So, the turnover is not expected to have an immediate effect on the course of the war.

And while there are some protesters in the streets of Montreal, the mass movement for biodiversity is far smaller than the one demanding climate justice.

One reason for the relative quiet may be that it can be easier, and in some cases more satisfying, to focus on spectacles of extinction. Rescuing a threatened species from oblivion is enormously difficult, but it is far simpler than changing our priorities to restore the complex, interdependent systems of life on Earth.

Biodiversity protection is more complicated than climate protection, since it relies less directly on technology such as cheaper solar panels and has fewer clear measures of success.

So we dwell, with appalled fascination, on the northern white rhino, a subspecies that has only two surviving members — both female — and whose future may depend on the ability of reproductive scientists to turn skin cells into stem cells and eventually into viable sperm and egg cells. We ponder curiosities such as so-called de-extinction, an unproven technology that may one day succeed in creating a hybrid individual with DNA from extinct and extant species, but will never reverse extinction. Or we post and donate on behalf of vulnerable species on other continents, conflating our concern with effective action. Suzanne Brandon, a Ph.D. student in sociology who studied the experiences of “voluntourists” in Namibia, found that while they felt outrage about the overall plight of the species, they were largely unaware or dismissive of local conservation policies and practices.

That’s the real trouble with spectacles of extinction: By seizing our attention and our hearts, they obscure the countless ongoing efforts to protect biodiversity from the ground up. Throughout the plains of North America, for example, the Indigenous communities whose expertise the conservation movement has long ignored are returning bison to the prairie ecosystem. In watersheds in North America and Europe, beavers, once persecuted as pests, have been embraced by an enthusiastic network of landowners and public-land managers as partners in restoration. Where I live, in the Pacific Northwest, a small, not particularly flashy butterfly called the Fender’s blue inspired a collaboration that has not only recovered the species but helped restore its prairie habitat. And in Namibia, a leader in the worldwide community-led conservation movement, a national system of local conservancies has enabled those who live alongside endangered and other species to both participate in their protection and benefit from the resulting tourism and hunting opportunities.

But it hasn’t worked out that way.

Average retail electricity costs in the 35 states that have partly or entirely broken apart the generation, transmission and retail distribution of energy into separate businesses have risen faster than rates in the 15 states that have not deregulated, including Florida and Oregon. That difference has persisted for much of the last two decades or so, including in the last year, when energy prices increased worldwide after Russia invaded Ukraine.

On average, residents living in a deregulated market pay $40 more per month for electricity than those in the states that let individual utilities control most or all parts of the grid. Deregulated areas have had higher prices as far back as 1998.

“After the numbers are that far apart for this long you have to wonder if something isn’t working very well,” said Robert McCullough, an energy researcher and consultant who analyzed electricity rate data at the request of The New York Times. “If your car hasn’t been working for 20 years, maybe you should take it to the dealership.”"

If completed, the 2.6-gigawatt wind farm would produce enough electricity to power more than 900,000 homes, without creating any of the carbon dioxide emissions that are heating the planet.

The project is expected to provide about 900 jobs each year during the construction phase and support an estimated 1,100 annual jobs once it begins operating. “More progress and economic opportunity are on the horizon as we put to use every tool available to bring offshore wind benefits to American workers and communities nationwide,” said Ali Zaidi, the White House national climate adviser.

The decision comes at a perilous time for the offshore wind industry. To fight climate change, the Biden administration wants to install 30 gigawatts of offshore wind power in the United States by 2030.

Scott, a dengue epidemiologist and professor emeritus at University of California, Davis.

Outside Puerto Rico and other territories where the disease is endemic, there are about 550 dengue cases each year in the United States, but they are imported by travelers who were infected abroad and passed the disease along to their close contacts.

The case in Pasadena is a rare locally acquired case of dengue in the United States. City officials said on Friday that they had been trapping and testing mosquitoes in the neighborhood where the case was reported and had not found any further insects with the virus.

But scientists say dengue will continue to spread to places that haven’t experienced it before.

In addition to climate change, rising rates of urbanization around the world are playing a role, said Alex Perkins, who is an associate professor of biological sciences at the University of Notre Dame and an expert in the mathematical modeling of dengue transmission. If people have recently come from rural areas, they are unlikely to have priority immunity, so the virus can move swiftly through the population.

“I don’t think that the case in Pasadena or anything else that I’ve seen lately is an indication of any looming crisis in the United States in the short term,” Dr. Perkins said. “But I think the general expectation that this is going to be a growing problem in the United States is reasonable.”"

Ms. Sturgeon served as the deputy first minister of Scotland under Alex Salmond, her one-time political mentor, and the pair led the campaign for Scotland to become independent from the United Kingdom. But after a failed independence referendum in 2014, in which 55 percent of Scottish voters supported staying in the union, Mr. Salmond stepped down as the head of the Scottish National Party.

In November 2014, Ms. Sturgeon was elected leader of the party unopposed, becoming Scotland’s first minister and the first woman to hold that position. Months later, the party won a landslide victory during the British general election, increasing its six seats in the House of Commons to 56, out of 59 seats allotted to Scotland.

“The tectonic plates of Scottish politics shifted,” Ms. Sturgeon said of that election.

Her brand of Scottish nationalism has been aimed at a global audience, and she has regularly positioned herself on the world stage, advocating for an independent Scotland that engages with the world.

“People who think of a nationalist party sometimes think, inward-looking and parochial,” she said during a 2015 interview with The New York Times. “The kind of nationalism I represent is the opposite of that.”"

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has tightened his grip on India’s democracy, critics and analysts say, by leaning on the judiciary to protect his party’s allies and to target rivals.

Last week, a court sentenced India’s best-known opposition leader, Rahul Gandhi, to two years in prison for criminal defamation — the exact length of time needed to oust him from Parliament.

Legal experts said the case against Gandhi, which stemmed from a 2019 speech in which he seemed to liken Modi to a pair of prominent “thieves” with the same last name, was flimsy. Still, it might prevent Gandhi from contesting elections for years to come.

Modi’s immense popularity, forged through a combination of Hindu nationalism and extensive welfare offerings, has allowed his government to bend the judicial system to its will through pressure and enticements. Judges who are seen as pliable have gone on to receive cushy roles in Parliament, governorships, or appointments to government commissions. Those who show streaks of independence face career stagnation."

My Bike

There’s no doubt in my mind that the high point of my 8th year was getting a bicycle. A beautiful blue Schwinn. Later to be replaced by a white Peugeot, then a brown Nishiki, then a titanium Klein, and finally by a fat-tire American Flyer with electric assist — a compromise that my age and physical condition dictate, but I’m still riding!

‘Midnight Run’

This is one of those perfect films. There’s not one misstep in the whole two hours and six minutes. Bob De Niro is great, as always, and though Charles Grodin is no longer with us, he was, and remains, a national treasure. It’s a brilliant script by George Gallo and flawlessly directed by Martin Brest. I would argue that it is one of the three best comedies of all time. The other two being “Bridesmaids” and “The In-Laws” — a self-serving selection, admittedly, but true nonetheless.

My LEED Platinum Home

Twelve-inch-thick walls, passive solar design, a 10,000-gallon rainwater tank, a gray-water system for the fruit trees, steel construction to avoid taking down trees to build a home. Not to mention the fire hazard when building homes out of sticks. Six raised beds and four compost bins allow me to grow a good deal of my own food. All of it proving that living more sustainably is certainly possible.

‘Loves of a Blonde’

Milos Forman certainly made a good many fine films, several of them big hits like “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” and “Amadeus.” But there is an extraordinary early film of his, made [in Czechoslovakia] in 1965. If you haven’t seen it, please try to find it somewhere. It is a gem."

I spoke with Robert Drummond, a retired politics professor at York University in Toronto. “There are a lot of movements that don’t seem to have any particular reason for doing it,” Professor Drummond said.

A few of the changes stood out as attempts to dim the spotlight on stubborn issues that have recently troubled ministers like Mr. Mendicino, who denied having been alerted by his office or correctional services staff that the country’s most infamous serial killer would be transferred into a medium-security prison.

Pablo Rodriguez, the former heritage minister, had become the face of the government’s bitter fight with tech giants as they retaliated against a law, passed last month, that would force them to pay Canadian news outlets. Mr. Rodriguez was reassigned to transport.

Reports describe a spectacularly wide disaster zone, recovery efforts that are too slow, leaving untold hundreds and possibly thousands of victims still buried, alive and dead, under the rubble — and hundreds of thousands more in the cold without homes, food, drinking water or medical supplies.

From New York Times Opinion, this is “The Ezra Klein Show.”

roge karma

Hey, everyone. It’s Rogé here. I’m the senior editor for “The Ezra Klein Show,” filling in for Ezra while he’s on book leave. Before I get into today’s episode, I have some bittersweet news, which is that this will actually be the last episode I will be guest hosting. At the end of August, I will be officially leaving the show to pursue my own writing and journalism career. I’ll say a bit more on all of that in the outro. But for now, I do want to get into today’s episode. So we’ve done a few shows now on the decarbonization effort here in the U.S. But decarbonization is necessarily a global phenomenon. Nearly 90 percent of annual greenhouse gas emissions come from outside the United States. So when we talk about decarbonization, what we’re really talking about is totally transforming the entire world’s energy system. And energy is the foundation of the global economy, of military power, of the relationships between countries, of, basically, everything. And so when you change the world’s energy system, you’re completely upending all of that, too. So I wanted to have a conversation that takes a global view of decarbonization and the kinds of transformations and collisions and tensions that come with it. And the two individuals who I think have done some of the best work on this are Meghan O’Sullivan and Jason Bordoff. O’Sullivan is the newly appointed director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the Harvard Kennedy School, and previously served in multiple government roles, including as a deputy national security adviser in that George W. Bush administration, and Bordoff is the founding director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, and also spent time in both the Clinton and Obama administrations, including as the senior director for energy and climate change for Obama’s National Security Council. And in recent years, both Bordoff and O’Sullivan have together done some of the deepest analysis of the crucial nexus between the world’s changing energy system and the realities of geopolitics. So I wanted to bring them on to talk about that intersection and what it means for the future of the world as we know it. As always, if you have feedback or guest suggestions, the show email is ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. Let’s get to it. Jason Bordoff, Meghan O’Sullivan, welcome to “The Ezra Klein Show.”

jason bordoff

Thanks for having us on. Good to be with you.

meghan o'sullivan

Great to be with you, Rogé.

roge karma

So your big picture argument is that decarbonization isn’t some simple shift in what kind of cars we drive or how we power our homes, that it represents a much more fundamental transformation of the global economy and geopolitics. So talk me through that idea. What is the energy transition, as it’s sometimes called? And what does it mean for the world?

meghan o'sullivan

Maybe I could start by just saying it is so easy to underestimate the scope, the scale, the complexity of this energy transition. Maybe most people think of it simply as switching an energy source from one to another. They think about going from a gas driven car to an electric vehicle, but it is so much more complicated than that. It is essentially changing not just what energy source we use, but changing how we produce, store, transport, and use energy. And energy, of course, is at the foundation of virtually everything that humans do. So we’re talking about remaking the entire energy system of the world. And that is the backbone of a $100 trillion global economy, so this is a massive undertaking. And what makes it even more complicated is that unlike other energy transitions in the past, we’re talking about doing it in a very compressed time frame due to the urgency of climate change.

jason bordoff

Just think about the moment we’re in today. The summer of 2023 will be the warmest ever recorded on planet Earth. Last month, in July, in China, there was a town that recorded a temperature of 126 degrees, the highest ever in the country. And on that very same day, John Kerry, the U.S. climate envoy, showed up in Beijing to restart talks between the two world’s largest emitters on climate change, because there’s no solution to climate that doesn’t include the U.S. and China. And Kerry was largely rebuffed. China didn’t seem to have a lot of interest in talking with us because we’re in a moment of some of the worst tensions between two of the world’s great powers. The world is shifting to clean energy sources that depend on a lot of minerals we’ll talk about that are very dominant heavily concentrated in China. Forces of fragmentation are growing at a time when we need more, not less, cooperation and trade in clean energy. There are growing forces of backlash from the developing world, lower income countries toward how the rich countries are approaching this problem. So there are a host of broad geopolitical trends, challenges, that are complicating the effort to move as quickly as we need to clean energy. And the reverse is true, too, that the transition to clean energy, if we’re not careful and thoughtful about it, risks exacerbating some of those challenging geopolitical trends. That has been a lot of the focus of what Meghan and I have been collaborating on how to think about.

roge karma

Before we get to a lot of these different geopolitical dimensions, I also just want to level-set where we are, just in terms of energy and the transition on an even more basic level, because it sometimes feels like we’re in something of a contradictory place right now in the transition. So, on the one hand, over the last year, we’ve seen a flurry of really unprecedented clean energy investments, right, including the Inflation Reduction Act here in the U.S. And those investments are working with the fact that the price of wind and solar and E.V.s have come down dramatically over the last decade, which means despite what’s happening this summer, we’re on track for much better warming targets than just a few years ago. And on the other hand, total emissions continue to rise. Oil and gas demand hit a new record last year and is expected to hit another this year. The fossil fuel industry is projected to spend more than $500 billion this year alone to bring new oil and gas supply online, which, for context, the I.R.A. was originally projected to spend $370 billion over 10 years. So where are we right now in the energy transition? And how should we think about what feel like very contradictory indicators?

jason bordoff

Well, I think it’s a really insightful and astute question. And I think, for the reasons Meghan talked about, the scale and magnitude of this challenge and how unprecedented it is, two things can both be true at the same time. When you look at where we are in clean energy, there is a lot to be excited about. 20 million E.V.s on the road, that figure is going to grow 35 percent this year. The cost of solar, of wind and batteries, has fallen 80 percent, 90 percent in the last decade. When you look at how much renewables we added in the last 20 years, we’re going to do that again in just the next five. So, on almost every metric you look at, we are exceeding many of our wildest expectations. We’re breaking record after record for the pace of clean energy deployment, for the pace of clean energy cost declines. And as you said, other than a pandemic or a recession, oil use is going up every year, coal use is going up, gas use is going up, and emissions are going up. That’s what happens when you take a global economy as big as the one we are, when you have huge numbers of people around the world who use very little energy at all, when you grow populations, when you give people higher levels of prosperity. As much as we talk about the phrase “energy transition,” the history of energy is not one of transition — it’s one of addition. And by that, I mean when we think of transitions, we think of going from wood to coal, or coal to oil, these great historic transitions that take decades to play out in the Industrial Revolution. That’s true as a percentage of the total. But what the planet cares about is not percentages of the total. The planet cares about how much fossil fuels we’re using and how much CO2 we’re emitting by burning them. That number has never gone down. We’re using more wood today than we did in the 19th century. That’s because the denominator keeps getting bigger. That’s what happens when the amount of energy the world is using goes up because of rising levels of income and rising populations around the world. So if we want to have a clean energy transition that solves the climate crisis, we need to do something we’ve never done before, which is not just have a transition where we add a lot of clean energy and the percent of the total that is fossil fuels goes down. We need the total amount of hydrocarbons to start going down and the emissions associated with them to go down, or otherwise be captured or stored.

meghan o'sullivan

So just to reinforce the excellent point that Jason just made, last year, 2022, the world used more coal than it ever has before. And so even though we’re making these huge additions in renewable energy, that’s basically, simply, able to fuel the increase in energy demand that is happening globally. And it is, again, only in a recession or pandemic that energy use has gone down.

roge karma

So you both have made the case that one way of thinking about this moment is that we’re leaving behind an age of energy security and entering an age of energy insecurity. I want you to unpack that because, in many ways, it seems like a decarbonized world would be a much more energy secure world than one run on fossil fuels, right? Like, oil and gas are these zero-sum resources concentrated in a handful of countries, and that means when Vladimir Putin decides to invade Ukraine, or OPEC feels like prices have gotten too low, you get all kinds of price fluctuations and shortages and so on. But the sun and wind provide more than enough energy to power the world. No country has a monopoly on them. And so it at least seems like a greener energy system would also be a much more secure one. So maybe we could start with you here, Meghan. What does that view get right, and what does it miss?

meghan o'sullivan

Well, I think that view is very accurate when we talk about the geopolitics or the security of energy in a net-zero world, so a world where we do have an energy sustainable global economy. And often, people assign the day 2050 to that. Those are sort of the global ambitions, is to get to net-zero, and I think it’s true. And Jason and I have written about this. It is likely that that sort of world is more energy secure, and there are fewer uncertainties and potentially even less volatility. What that portrayal misses — and this is something that Jason and I really are focused on — is that the transition from, let’s just say, 2050, from today to 2050, is anything but smooth. It’s anything but incremental. That actually, there are all kinds of uncertainties and fluctuations and volatility in the system making that transition because, again, we’re thinking about not a transition that is only driven by the market, which would be, in itself, uncertain, in some respects. We’re talking about a transition that has a huge element of geopolitics as countries think about the energy transition is actually having competitive advantage. We think about countries that look at the transition as something that’s a threat to their economies. And so you may have countries that want to thwart the transition. And then you have others that are seeking to expedite it. So there’s a huge element of policy, there’s a huge element of geopolitics, and there’s a huge element of technology. All of these things come together to make the energy transition very uncertain in ways that we can discuss, especially when we think about oil producers today. How are they looking at the system, and what does that mean for their relative power base? In a net-zero world, they’re likely to have less geopolitical influence than maybe they do today. But that doesn’t mean between now and then, that it’s a straight decline. Instead, we’ve actually argued — and we’re seeing it now — that these countries have enhanced geopolitical influence and economic influence because of the nonlinear nature of this transition.

jason bordoff

What you described, Rogé, I think is absolutely the promise. We are being reminded, if we needed any reminder, by the crisis that was prompted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, that if we shifted toward a clean energy system that was much more dependent on electricity, more dependent on renewable energy, although not entirely, you’d have less dependence on globally traded hydrocarbons that are inevitably exposed to geopolitical risk. So the urgency of climate is now matched with a growing recognition of the urgency of energy security, which I think a lot of people forgot was a risk for many years. And the promise now is really to harness those two forces together to accelerate the move faster to clean energy. What Meghan and I have been writing about some of the risks that come with that transition that she just described. And I think, as she said, they sort of fall into three buckets. The first is the end state when we get to a net-zero economy — and we are not on track for that at all, but hopefully we get there. And that new clean energy system has its own potential risks. Heavy dependence on critical minerals will come to that, I’m sure, most of that done in China today. A system that has much more solar and wind, which tends to be more variable, places much greater strains on the grid in the need for flexibility to manage that. So you’ve got to manage these things carefully. As Meghan said, that’s many decades in the future. And the process of getting from here to there, if we’re not careful and thoughtful, can be messy and volatile and disorderly. And that presents its own risks to the legacy hydrocarbon system, not to mention the emerging clean energy system. And the third thing I would just mention is that climate change itself is going to be a major threat to energy security in the coming decades. Warmer water, severe droughts make it harder to cool power plants or nuclear plants, can affect hydropower output, even affect wind speeds. So the impacts of climate change themselves can create risks to energy security. The last thing I’ll say is, none of this is to suggest we should slow down the pace at which we’re moving to clean energy. We need to move a lot faster, as world events are reminding us this summer. But it is important for us to be cleareyed about what the risks are because if we don’t navigate them, if we don’t anticipate them, if we don’t de-risk the transition, if people see challenges with affordability or reliability to energy and the process of transition, there could be a backlash. I mean, you could lose support for the faster climate action we need.

roge karma

So one area of the bumpiness that you both talked about on the path from here to a net-zero world is one that you alluded to, which is that the move to clean energy isn’t going to completely get rid of resource constraints. It’s just that the key resource constraint is going to shift to what you just referred to, Jason, as critical minerals. And you both just wrote this big report on critical minerals. So tell me first what critical minerals are and how they are important to the energy transition, but then more specifically, the most obvious analogy here is to say critical minerals are the new oil. So what does that analogy get right, and what does it miss?

jason bordoff

So the transition to clean energy depends heavily on these so-called critical minerals, like lithium and nickel and a range of things that are needed for clean energy, such as batteries and solar. They’re used for a lot of other things, too, including the iPhones in our pockets and sensitive defense requirements and other things. But the kind of goals we’re talking about to get to net-zero emissions by 2050, the projections are that demand for critical minerals go up something like sixfold. We’re not on track for our climate goals, and copper demand is projected right now to double by 2030. These are huge increases. And I think it is hard for people to fully appreciate the scale and magnitude of how difficult it is to grow those supplies. Today, it takes an average of 16 years to bring a new mining project to development. And you know it’s not easy to build mines all over the place. And those have impacts. They have impacts on Indigenous communities if we’re not careful, on the environment if we’re not careful. And today, there is a lot of concentration of where those minerals come from. If you look at oil, for example, the largest producers of oil, the U.S., Saudi Arabia, and Russia, each produce around 10 percent of world supply. If you look at the largest producer of cobalt, the rare earth elements, the largest producer, each of those is more than 50 percent of world supply. And most of 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent of the refining and processing is done in China. So there’s a very heavy dependence on China right now in global supply chains that creates a lot of concern about what happens if the whole clean energy system becomes dependent on these minerals moving forward.

meghan o'sullivan

Let me pick up where Jason just stopped to answer the specific part of the question, Rogé, about to what extent is this a parallel to oil. And obviously, oil is the easiest thing for people to get in their heads because this is a physical commodity. And so, it is involved in geopolitics in a similar way. And I’d say there are certain parallels, obviously. But the parallels break down in a couple of ways. I’d say the first thing and the most important thing is that the critical mineral is an input into something else, rather than the commodity itself that powers the economy directly. So certainly, if the supply of these inputs are disrupted for political reasons, for natural disaster reasons, supply chain, whatever the reason, it is going to have an effect on the economy. And these critical minerals — the U.S., in 2022, identified 50 of them — these critical minerals are identified. By definition, they have importance to America’s economic and national security interests. So a disruption of supply would have an impact on our economy. But it wouldn’t necessarily be as pervasive as an oil embargo. It wouldn’t mean that our economy seizes up in short order. It might be a little bit more like what we’ve experienced last year with chip shortages and how that affects supply chains and increases the cost of anyone who rented a car or trying to buy a car or these types of things. So it would have disruptions, and some of those could be very concentrated in industries, maybe the automotive industry, certainly in the world of defense, where a lot of critical minerals are used. So that’s the first thing, is that they’re different. It’s an input, rather than the commodity that actually powers everything. One difference as well is that actually, in today’s world, the production of these critical minerals is much more concentrated than oil and gas. And the U.S., again, by definition, a critical mineral is one that we have heavy import dependence on. So for 15 of the 50 minerals, the U.S. is reliant on imports for 100 percent of our consumption. And for the other 35, it’s more than half or about half. And so this import dependency is problematic when you have a very concentrated number of producers because when we think about how do we protect ourselves against anything that may be disruptive, well, we have a diversity of suppliers. That’s what we try to do when we were importing a lot of oil, is to have a diversity of suppliers. But it’s hard to do if the concentration is of production is so focused on just a number of countries. So that’s one of the reasons why some of the vulnerability is even more acute than it might be when it comes to oil.

roge karma

This brings us to the country that you all have mentioned a few times, which controls a lot of these minerals right now, and that’s China. And here, I want to pick up on one of the points you got out in the report, which is that it doesn’t really make sense to think of control of clean energy technologies, control of these minerals, and then what they create as one thing. It’s really three separate components, right? One is where the raw minerals are located, which, as you said, is highly concentrated, but then two is of who has the capacity to process them into a form that’s usable. And then three, it’s who has the manufacturing capabilities to take those process minerals and turn them into E.V. batteries or solar panels or whatever, which, as you alluded to, is like one of the differences, I think, between these critical minerals and oil. But China really dominates all three of these right now. So just to put some numbers on it, different minerals are located in different places, but China currently supplies around 70 percent of the world’s rare earths, which are really crucial for a bunch of clean energy technologies. And then where China really dominates is processing in manufacturing. For instance, China currently processes the bulk of the world’s lithium, cobalt and graphite. And Chinese companies currently control more than 75 percent of the world’s E.V. battery and solar P.V. manufacturing supply chains. And so what you’ll hear from lots of folks in the Biden administration — Jake Sullivan has said things like this, John Podesta — is that they’re worried that China could weaponize its control over clean energy supply chains in the same way that Russia did with oil and gas. To your point, Jason, it’s only going to have more leverage. It could possibly be even more painful because of how much of the market that China controls. And already just last month, China announced export controls on two metals, gallium and germanium, that are key inputs to solar cells, among other things. And so the big question I have — and I’d love to start here with you, Meghan — is, how worried should we be about China weaponizing these supply chains? And how could it affect the energy transition if they do?

meghan o'sullivan

Let me make three points. First, I think the world, the Biden administration, people in general, analysts, others, are right to be concerned. As you described very accurately, China has enormous dominance of these clean energy supply chains right now. And so then the question is, do they have the intention to use these for geopolitical or other economic purposes? And I think, obviously, there’s some costs that would be borne by China if it did this, but we have a couple of examples — certainly, China’s stoppage of the export of rare earth elements to Japan in 2010 when there was a dispute over some islands in the East China Sea. And then, as you mentioned, just a few weeks ago, we had two critical minerals and export controls that China put in place. So, clearly, they are inclined, potentially, to use this as they see it in their interest. But they may not only use export controls or bans. They could also do something that we’ve found a lot of potential investors and manufacturers are worried about. They could dump a lot of these critical minerals onto the global market at a critical moment. And that could really eviscerate some of the investments that people are making in increasing the production and processing of these minerals in other parts of the world. So they have the ability to create a lot of uncertainty in these markets in a way that undermines investments and allows them to maintain their dominance. So it’s a legitimate concern. My second point would be that we really need to look at this on a mineral by mineral basis. The numbers that you suggested are very important and indicative of the leverage that China could have, but we have to go a deeper level because take, for instance, copper and nickel, where China processes 40 percent and 35 percent of global supply. That’s true. You would think that gives them enormous leverage. However, they use a huge amount of those minerals themselves. So we have to look at, are they actually exporters? So they may be doing a lot of the global processing, but they may be consuming them themselves. So they may not be exporting the minerals. So we need to really separate out on a mineral by mineral basis where they have leverage. And it’s not across all 50 of these minerals. It’s more targeted. And then we need to focus our action on those minerals that they have the processing capability, and they also are very influential in the global trade of those minerals. So rare earth elements is the most vulnerable spot. And you gave us some good statistics on that. And there, you have China that does the production, the processing, and dominates the global export market. Lastly, the third point I’d make is, so what does this mean? What are we going to do? A lot of people have responded to these realities by saying we’ve got to produce all this stuff at home in the United States. And I think there’s no question. In the task force that you reference that Jason and I co-chaired — and the report was just released in June — the task force says, yes, we have to do a lot more to increase production in the United States because we do geologically have a lot of these minerals. But it also says we can’t fool ourselves to think that the United States is going to be able to meet all of its own needs. Even if the geology suggested we could, mining in the United States, there’s a long history. We could go into it in great depth, but there’s a lot of social and political and environmental factors that will make it hard for us to really mine everything that we could potentially mine in this country. And so we have to think about how to work with others in order to get enough global production that is not constrained in China. And we also have to recognize that there is going to be a relationship with China that is around these critical minerals, and that we have to think about how to manage that in a way, because it is not going to be something that we’re going to be able to replace, particularly in the time frame in which it’s going to become really urgent.

jason bordoff

Let me just add two quick points, one on how worried we should be. And she talked about the possibility of mining. We should remember, at least from the standpoint of China, China’s dominance, for the most part, is about the refining and processing. That’s about manufacturing. It’s not about geologic abundance. There’s a lot of cheap oil in Saudi Arabia. There’s not a lot of cheap oil in many other places. You can build facilities to do refining and processing of critical minerals in almost anywhere. It takes time. It takes investment. That doesn’t happen overnight. So it is a different kind of challenge than the geologic good fortune of nature about where oil or gas supply is. There’s a question about how to think about the concern with critical minerals. They’re important for not just clean energy, as we talked about before. iPhones, almost — we depend on China for a lot of pieces of the global supply chain. And when you listen to administration officials — Jake Sullivan, for example, in an important speech at Brookings recently, talking about a small yard and a high fence. And by that, the administration saying we want a lot of trade with China. But there’s a small number of things that are very sensitive, have national security or defense implications. And in that area, we’re going to try to distance ourselves and try to reduce our dependence on China. So the question is, when you’re talking about batteries or solar panels, where do they fall on that spectrum? How should we think about them? Are they a commodity, like everything else you need for your iPhone? Or is there something particularly sensitive that would make us want to think differently about that? And I think the answer is, wherever you put it on that spectrum, with energy security generally, ever since Winston Churchill famously said, security in oil lies in variety and variety alone, a big part of the answer is diversification. It’s part of the reason you’re seeing Apple move iPhone production toward India and some other places to reduce dependence on China. Now, as Meghan said, diversification can’t mean we do everything domestically. It’s simply not going to be possible. And we can go into why we think that is. So diversification means you need to be working with a lot of other partners around the world. We need more free trade agreements, more trade partnerships, at a time when protectionism is in vogue, and there’s been a retreat on both sides of the aisle from support for some free trade principles. So we need to engage more with a very broad array of partners around the world. We might want to think about other tools. With oil, for example, we have strategic stockpiles. And I don’t want to forget the fact that we should think about reducing demand. You can recycle. You can use minerals more efficiently. And there’s a range of electrochemistry technologies in the works that might allow us to build a lot of these clean energy components with far fewer inputs. And that would be a huge win as well.

roge karma

So for all the reasons you both just talked about, policymakers are really trying to, quote unquote, “de-risk” their clean energy supply chains from China. And the way they’ve mostly gone about doing that is by building up domestic capacity, right? So the Inflation Reduction Act has all these provisions designed to help onshore production of clean energy technologies to domestically source inputs like critical minerals. Europe’s green industrial plan has a similar intent. And as you’re saying, you both have been very sort of critical of this strategy. But I think the response you’d get from folks in the Biden administration would go something like this. First, integration is great in theory. In an ideal world, we’d be able to rely on trade and cooperation, but that’s just not the world we’re living in. On one level, there are some countries willing to weaponize their resources. But even beyond that, something we’ve seen over the past few years is that at the end of the day, when there are massive shocks to global supply chains, countries tend to look out for themselves and their people first. And so, if, for some reason, there’s a shock that creates critical mineral shortages or disrupts the battery supply chain, which is very possible, if that happens, and we’re dependent on other countries for those things, then we’re vulnerable. We’re exposed. And so the only way to guarantee security for ourselves is to build thriving industries right here at home. And then there’s also the political reality, right? There’s a reason Joe Biden’s favorite line is, what I think climate, I think jobs. The voters Democrats need to win tend to see jobs in the economy as much higher priorities than addressing climate change. And so to be able to attach climate policy to jobs here at home is what allows these policies to pass in the first place. And it’s also what helps protect them from backlash. Like, if you want to prevent a future Republican trifecta from repealing the I.R.A., you need to create enough jobs in red and purple states such that it becomes politically disastrous to do so. And so, yeah, integration sounds great in theory, but the political realities, both globally and domestically, are working against it. And so I guess, my question for you would be, A, what your response to some of those arguments would be, but then, B, what this more integrationist approach, this more cooperative approach, would actually look like?

jason bordoff

It’s a really insightful question, and you’re describing the tension the Biden administration is dealing with. Industrial strategy is back in vogue, and there is a lot to celebrate about that. There’s a lot of opportunity there for how we think about the economy, how we think about the American middle class and how we think about the manufacturing base here. And as Jake Sullivan said in that speech at Brookings, part of it is just that the assumptions we had about how a globally integrated economy would work 20 or 25 years ago, China’s not playing by those rules. And so we need to adjust our strategy accordingly. I think one important area of a reality check on that is — and you’ve talked a lot about this, you and Ezra on this podcast — how difficult it is to build at scale in this country. And if we want to have a clean energy transition at the speed and scale we need, we should do a lot more domestically, but it is going to be very hard for things like critical minerals, for example, to do all of that here at home. So if you veer too far in the direction of protectionism, that can undermine our ability to move as quickly as we need toward clean energy because it raises costs. We need much more trade in certain clean energy technologies. The I.E.A. shows trade in critical minerals increases threefold in a scenario where we meet our climate goals. There’s a range of studies showing that a big part of the decline we’ve seen in the cost of solar photovoltaic modules has been because we’ve had global trade. So we can’t do everything at home. We don’t have the resources. It takes a really long time to build. We’re going to need a lot of trade, and there’s a risk to cost inflation. There’s a risk to the energy transition if we’re not working and engaged in global partnerships. Then we need to think about how to do that in ways that are secure and resilient. Those are important goals. But if security and resilience veer too far in the direction of protectionism or everything has to be by America, that can be a risk not just economically but also can be a risk to the pace of the clean energy transition because of what it means for some of the costs of getting there.

So I would say, when we talk about integration, and maybe I’m splitting hairs here, but we’re not saying, let’s leave this all to globalization. This isn’t a return to a world of no great power competition that we enjoyed for many decades, where globalization really took care of a lot of these things. We’re talking about greater integration with potentially a smaller set of countries — but still a large set — but more of a regional approach or an approach of countries that are willing to sign up to certain standards that are negotiated, so that essentially — let’s take critical minerals because we’ve been talking about that as an example, that, sure, it makes sense to do what we can to try to increase production in the United States, but we can’t do that with the expectation that we’re going to meet all our needs. So it has to be complemented by an international approach that recognizes that a lot of the mining and the processing and maybe even some of the manufacturing will happen in other countries. And how can we make sure that growth is done in a way that is beneficial to all parties? And that will require pushing back on this protectionist impulse that we’ve had, because if we want countries in South America or in Africa or in other parts of the world to increase their production, and we want them to do them according to certain standards that are consistent with American values, we need to find a way to get finance there. And likely, we need to look at our trade relationships to ensure that there are markets for these things. So all of this is a web. And in some ways, it’s good because we’re in a world where there can be things we agree on that push us in the direction of doing things that we might not otherwise do. So the fact that it’s a bipartisan issue to compete with China, maybe that will be the basis for us to do certain things that we wouldn’t normally do, not only in the domestic world in terms of changing permitting and all of that, but maybe in the international realm, in terms of getting agreements and maybe even negotiating or introducing the idea of market access back into our economic tools in foreign policy. [MUSIC PLAYING]

roge karma

Let’s then talk about what this more integrationist approach could look like in practice. Jason, you wrote this piece about a year ago when the I.R.A. first passed, arguing that its success would hinge on the foreign policy that went with it. So walk me through the case you made there. But then also, it’s been about a year now. What has the Biden administration done well? And what isn’t it doing that it should be doing?

jason bordoff

Yeah, the piece, I appreciate your calling it out. I thought it was important to point out this is an extraordinary domestic achievement. And that’s the starting point, right? We don’t know if it’s half a trillion or a trillion, but it is by far the largest investment in clean energy in our nation’s history, maybe any country’s history, at a time when the planet is reminding us every day about the urgency of the climate crisis. So the Biden administration has taken a much more significant step on climate than any U.S. administration ever, and that’s an extraordinary achievement. It is difficult to implement, and again, on this podcast, you’ve explored a bunch of the reasons why. It’s hard to build transmission lines and the land use that’s needed, the permitting reform, how long it takes to do things. The point of the piece I wrote at the time was two points. First, successful implementation requires not only domestic action, like permitting reform, how we think about NEPA and environmental rules. It requires successful foreign policy to avoid trade conflict with Europe, so we can build partnerships for things like critical minerals security. Maybe so we could work collaboratively now that we’ve taken this extraordinary climate action, Europe is putting in place border tariffs for carbon. They’re thinking about things like climate clubs where some countries are in the club, some are not. And you might face a tariff on your products if you’re not. We can now cooperate, hopefully, and find ways to work together because we’re taking this extraordinary climate action. We need, again, more trade agreements for all the minerals we’re going to need. So we need to diversify suppliers. So successful trade policy, international economic policy is a vital part of the successful implementation of our domestic achievement, which is the I.R.A.. But that domestic achievement is also about 12 percent of global emissions. 88 percent of global emissions are outside the United States. And so what does it mean to take climate seriously for this administration or any administration? It is not just about domestic policy. It has to be about your international and foreign policy as well. And I think there, when we think about climate diplomacy, it’s extraordinary someone like a former Secretary of State, John Kerry, is in charge of that. But it’s not just these annual U.N. meetings, and can we reach agreements and promises to do things, which, by the way, most countries are not following through on. One of the major challenges now, in my view, is, how do we accelerate clean energy deployment in emerging and developing economies? That’s where the big growth is coming from in the next 20 years with emissions. How do we lower the barriers to private investment? How do we make more public investment available, and use all the tools of international economic policy, development of finance corporation, export credit, or a range of tools the U.S. government has to try to lower the barriers to investment and accelerate how quickly we can put public and private capital into getting clean energy built and in the ground in parts of the world where it can be harder, the barriers are higher, the cost of capital is higher. And I think there, the administration has done a lot, but frankly, we all need to be doing a lot more, including the administration.

meghan o'sullivan

Let me broaden the aperture so we’re not just talking about climate action. We’re talking about energy and climate action. And on the energy side, not that long ago, I think the Biden administration did a few things that were extraordinary and were well done. And I’ll just name a couple of them, but they’re in relationship to, shockingly, something we haven’t really mentioned yet, which is the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the energy crisis that that triggered in Europe, but that cascaded to much of the world. So in terms of responses that the Biden administration did well is it helped facilitate a lot of L.N.G. flowing to Europe. A lot of it was U.S. L.N.G., and of course, that was done by markets, but there were some diplomacy involved to get L.N.G. to flow from other parts of the world into Europe. And that was really important for Europe to be able to position itself much better and to actually get off Russian gas more quickly than I think most people expected. Secondly, there was the price cap that we’re all familiar with. And Jason and I were kind of skeptical about how well it was going to work, but I will certainly admit that it worked much better than I expected. That, essentially, there was a mechanism put in place, which seemed kind of confusing at the time, but it essentially allowed for Russian oil to keep flowing to the global economy, but to focus on trying to decrease the amount of revenues that Russia would get from those sales. And so that has been not seamless, but more successful than I think many could have anticipated. And then, lastly, when we’re thinking about this whole issue of energy security and climate action, the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia is really critical to managing the global economy because of the impact of Saudi Arabia and OPEC, of course, on energy prices. And that has been a very rocky relationship over the last year, and I think my sense is that both Riyadh and Washington are finding better ways of working together and both accepting some new realities that hopefully can have a good impact on diminishing some of the volatility that can be so pernicious to the global economy and to energy access for the developing world as well.

roge karma

I want to get to the developing world in a minute because I think that is one of the key questions of the transition, is that question of financing that you mentioned, Jason. But before we move on, I want to come back to China. Let’s say the Biden administration perfectly implements this integrationist friendshoring approach, right? We sign critical minerals agreements, we create climate clubs. We also clean up our act on permitting and successfully build out a lot of battery factors and lithium mines — the stuff of dreams, I know. Even in that best case scenario world, how realistic is it to think we can fully disentangle or de-risk from China when it comes to clean energy supply chains, while also meeting our decarbonization goals?

jason bordoff

I think China is going to remain a very significant part of supply chains for clean energy for a long time to come. That’s why it is important to think about de-risking and not decoupling, to use the kind of language of the day. It’s not going to be possible to disentangle, to completely separate yourself. But there are a number of steps that policymakers can take and individual companies can take to think about how they reduce the risks of potential shocks. And those could be conflict. Those could be geopolitically motivated. They could be a severe weather event. I mean, any concentration and excessive risk in one location is a concern, as we’ve been reminded, following the pandemic. So diversifying those supply chains, the possibility of strategic stockpiles, that’s harder for minerals because there’s so many of them than, say, it is for oil. But we can think about ones where it might make sense. And I think there are a number of other lessons that can be learned from energy security, from oil and the Arab oil embargo, the oil shock of the 1970s, the steps we took after that. Another one is governance cooperation. After the 1970s oil crisis, we built the International Energy Agency to provide more transparency, more trusted data, so markets could work more efficiently. So if there is a disruption in supply, you can import from other sources. Markets can respond and adjust. We had new mechanisms for cooperation between producers and consumers. Those are a number of the lessons that can be learned from past energy shocks to try to reduce the inevitable concentration that will continue to exist while we try to lower it for China and these supply chains.

meghan o'sullivan

I’d just like to emphasize, as we have in other contexts in this podcast, that two things can be true. One, it is unrealistic to think that we will, in your words, Rogé, fully disentangle ourselves from China when it comes to clean energy supply. So I think that is truly unrealistic. But at the same time, it is also true that it is an urgent need for us to try to move in the direction of becoming more sufficient with the help of friends and partners and allies around the world, and that we should aggressively and creatively seek to minimize our dependence on China. So those two things, I think, are true simultaneously. And I also think it’s useful for us to just acknowledge there is a real tension here. There is a real tradeoff here. And this is what policymakers grapple with all the time, that you could either decide, OK, we’re going to continue to have this very outsized vulnerability to China, but if everything goes well, it is probably the fastest path to an energy transition, although if everything goes well is a pretty big caveat. Or we can say, in our efforts to try to diminish that vulnerability to some extent, it may be more costly, and it may take a little bit of a longer time. And I think that is what policymakers are grappling with. And finding the right place to be in that spectrum, where you recognize there’s going to be some element of vulnerability, but you’re also willing to pay potentially a little bit of a higher price and maybe slow down things, hopefully not appreciably, but somewhat in order to allay that vulnerability, it’s a spectrum there. And you see it’s not just the United States that’s grappling with that. You look at India, and India’s thinking, we do not want to be completely reliant on China for solar power and energy. And so we’re going to develop a lot of this here in India. It’s going to be more expensive. It’s going to take us more time, but we’re not going to have that vulnerability. And there’s also benefits on that side that we already talked about if this helps with domestic manufacturing and domestic production and domestic economic things. That’s not only good for the economy, but it also helps build support in a constituency for clean energy action, and that is consequential as well.

roge karma

So I worry about where this leaves us, though, because, to your point, Meghan, I think there are going to be numerous points throughout this transition where we have to choose between de-risking from China, disentangling from China, and decarbonizing. And I would love if we could all just be levelheaded and find the right balance between those two. But my worry right now is that the political headwinds are really stacked against decarbonization, especially here in the U.S. And when it comes to the politics here, Republicans are mostly united on wanting to be tough on China and on not really caring that much about climate right now. There wasn’t a single Republican who voted for the I.R.A., but Democrats are divided. They really care about the climate, but they also don’t want to be seen as catering to China or promoting jobs in other countries. And so you get things like earlier this year, an example that always comes to my mind is that a bipartisan group of legislators in Congress passed a bill that would have placed tariffs on solar panels imported from Chinese manufacturers in Southeast Asia. And the idea there was that this would support the American solar industry and the jobs it could create here at home. But the flip side is that the U.S. imports a lot of its solar supplies from these Chinese companies, like a lot, which means these tariffs would have really raised prices and slowed the decarbonization effort. And so it was one of these moments when we had to make a choice. And in the end, Congress chose to pass the tariffs, but the Biden administration ended up vetoing them for those reasons, which I think was the right choice, in part because if we really care about decarbonization, the speed is really important, and keeping prices low is really important. But as the anti-China momentum continues to build on both sides of the aisle in the U.S., I worry that those kind of decisions, the kind of decisions where we choose to prioritize decarbonization, that those are going to get harder and harder to make, and that the politics of this issue are going to become more and more tilted against decarbonization, and that this would be really harmful to our ability to meet our climate goals. And I’m just wondering how you all think about that concern. Like, ideally, we’d be able to find some sort of balance, but I worry that, at least domestically, here in the U.S., the politics are going to make that harder and harder.

meghan o'sullivan

As long as we think about the way to make progress on climate as demanding cooperation, particularly between the U.S. and China, as long as we think that, I think we are in a mindset that is not going to bear the fruit we’re looking for, that we have moved away from a global environment where the dominant dynamic is cooperation, which was, actually, the dominant dynamic for much of the post-Cold War era up until — I don’t know — the last five or 10 years. And so it made sense that we tried to approach climate in a cooperative manner. It’s a transnational problem. And so it makes sense that cooperation would be the way in which we try to approach that. And that has to do with the U.S.-China Climate Agreement. It has to do with Paris. It has to do with COP. All of those things made sense. We’re now in just an utterly different global dynamic. We’re in a different geopolitical moment where great power competition is the dominant dynamic. And if we continue to think that climate is going to be some exception to that, and that we’re going to have to find a way to cooperate in order to get to where we want to go on climate action, I think we’re doomed to fail. That it’s kind of irresponsible for us to think, oh, we need cooperation to get to where we want to go. And we don’t have cooperation, and we don’t have good relations, then we’re not going to be able to get to where we want to go in climate. And we need to think more about how do we harness the competitive element of this, not just bilateral relationship, but really, a global dynamic, in order to leverage it to advance where we want to be on climate. And I think what this means a little bit more practically, I mean, the I.R.A. is a perfect example of that. So Rogé, you pointed out the agreement around being more competitive with China between Democrats and Republicans, and even though you didn’t have Republicans vote for the I.R.A., there are going to be a lot of Republican constituencies in the United States that benefit from the I.R.A.. And I think you could see some changes in support for such action. But again, I think the idea of competing with China and one of the ways that we’re going to compete with China is on climate. It’s not only going to be about Secretary Kerry trying to get cooperative mechanisms. We’re going to compete with China because climate is one of those dimensions where competition is going to be important. And then it could lead us to think about we need to compete with China in terms of building partnerships in the developing world for clean energy action because that is going to be an area of geopolitical advantage, as well as economic advantage. And if we can gain support for that, which, otherwise, I think wouldn’t have a lot of support in Congress for financing clean energy development in the developing world, but if it can be seen in the lens of competing with China, then we might be able to get somewhere.

jason bordoff

I completely agree with Meghan. I think it’s a really important point. And just to be clear about what we were saying, I don’t think we’re being pollyannaish or saying policymakers should approach the international global economy the same way we did in the early 1990s, or when China was welcomed into the W.T.O., and everything has to work that way — far from it. I think the point we were making was China is still going to be part of these supply chains. That’s a reality. You want to reduce that. You want to de-risk it. And there’s a bunch of stuff you can do there. But to your point, you asked about what does it mean for the priority of decarbonization and how quickly that has to happen. Of course, decarbonization is an urgent priority. And we have other policy priorities, too, like human rights and forced labor, intellectual property, cybersecurity. And it is legitimate to think about all of these things while you’re trying to navigate your policy with China. But I think what Meghan said is very important. We definitely need cooperation where it is possible. It seems quite hard now, and we shouldn’t assume that it is necessary to make progress. But if you think about the things that have been most consequential for the clean energy transition in the last 10, 20 years, we talked about how quickly the cost of solar has come down, of E.V.s and batteries has come down. That was a lot because China made an industrial strategy decision to dominate those industries and drive the cost down. They did that for reasons of competition. If you read Joe Manchin’s statement of support for the Inflation Reduction Act, it was not about climate change. It was about U.S. competitiveness and the health of our domestic economy and our energy security. And that competition — to own some of these areas, to be stronger in some of these emerging clean energy technologies — was a powerful motivator for the most significant piece of climate legislation that we have passed. And when you think about the things we have to do in the developing world to make more capital available for how those countries will evolve, you look at the Belt and Road Initiative China has put forth, as Meghan said, you can build hopefully build bipartisan cooperation, because this is not just about climate change. This is about America’s place in the world, about China’s place in the world. And those forces of competition, if we’re smart, can be harnessed to drive a faster transition at the same time that we’re trying to put in place a bunch of tools to increase energy security, increase our resilience, reduce the risks of the fact that, as we’ve talked about, China will still be a major player in a lot of these supply chains for a long time. [MUSIC PLAYING]

roge karma

We’ve been talking a lot about the West and China. But as you both have mentioned a few times now, whether or not we hit our climate goals really comes down to what happens in the developing world. I’ve seen estimates that by 2030, the developing world, even excluding China, will account for the majority of annual carbon emissions. So tell me, how is the energy transition going in the developing world? And what are the major obstacles or hurdles that we still need to overcome there?

jason bordoff

The energy transition in the emerging and developing economies is not going nearly fast enough. And it’s hard to overstate how important these parts of the world are. First, we should say what matters for climate change is the total emissions that have accumulated over time, historic emissions, not just the annual flow of emissions. Half of that comes from the U.S. and Europe, around 2 percent or 3 percent from Africa. So you’re talking about parts of the world that historically have not contributed to the problem that we’re confronting today. At the same time, when you look at where we’re headed going forward, there’s around two dozen countries or so between now and over the next 20 years, that if they develop in the same carbon intensive way that China did over the last 20 years, you’re talking about the same growth in emissions and the possibility of reaching goals, like one and a half or two degrees Celsius is almost impossible. And I’m not talking about the lowest income countries, sub-Saharan Africa, where there’s a very important story that we have to focus on for energy access to be able to use clean cooking fuels, people who use almost no energy at all. We’re talking about emerging market countries — India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh — that are growing incredibly rapidly. And there’s no, just, ethical or pragmatic way to have an energy transition if we don’t help people around the world who enjoy just a fraction of the standard of living that we do. You have a better standard of living, and that requires more energy use. But we have to figure out how to do that in a way that is lower carbon than has been the case in the past. This year, we’ll invest around $250 billion globally in clean energy in the emerging and developing economies. If we were on track for our climate goals, that number should be seven times higher, $2 trillion. So you’re talking about huge amounts of capital. Most of that will be private, but public capital has a role to play to help de-risk and catalyze that private capital. That has to be put to work, expanding the deployment of clean energy. And there are a lot of different and larger risks to doing that. We’ve done a lot of work at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia, for example, on currency exchange risk, which is one of the barriers to putting capital to work there, how might we overcome that with some innovative mechanisms. The cost of capital is about seven times higher in these parts of the world than it is if you’re looking at the developed world. So there’s a lot of action that we need to be taking and government leaders need to be taking to reduce some of those barriers so we can put capital to work in parts of the world that are going to need to use a lot more energy. They’re using almost very little energy today.

meghan o'sullivan

So I think it’s worth us trying to reflect a little bit of the anger that exists in the developing world and in emerging markets around this whole issue of the energy transition, because many leaders, in speaking with us, have emphasized you can’t transition when you don’t actually have energy. So before we are asked to transition to a different kind of energy, we need to have more energy. Obviously, the objective is that they would have more energy, but it would be of a clean energy nature. But for the developing world or for much of the developing world and the emerging markets, it is a question of energy access, which seems to trump the issue of climate. And so this goes back to our initial point about how energy security and climate action need to go hand in hand, because you can’t just talk to the developing world about climate and decreasing carbon emissions without talking about increasing energy access. And just to put a few numbers on what Jason was talking about, so if you’re in sub-Saharan Africa, you may be well aware that only 2 percent of the emissions in the world today come from sub-Saharan Africa, compared to a quarter from the United States, more than a quarter from Europe. And so there is a real feeling of injustice that part of the world that is not responsible for virtually any of the carbon emissions in the system today is bearing the brunt of climate change on the ground. So there’s a frustration there. I’ve heard a lot of frustration over what is perceived as hypocrisy that when energy security issues are dominant in the developed world, there is a rush to try to build more energy infrastructure that may rely on fossil fuels, whereas there’s a continued message to the rest of the world, don’t build that kind of infrastructure. So I think when we get at this whole question of the developing world, there are some of the realities that Jason underscored really well, but there’s a real anger, which is being amplified, not just by the energy transition, but by the multiple geopolitical crises that are affecting the developing world, whether it’s the food crisis or the energy crisis or global inflation or the many things that are coming out of the Russian invasion of Ukraine that are having a big impact much further afield than Europe.

roge karma

I really appreciate the way you’ve all brought in how this all looks from the perspective of these developing countries, because as you pointed out, I think one of the core injustices of this transition is that the countries who have contributed the least to global emissions are often the ones bearing the greatest brunt of the damage of climate change. And then, we, in the rich world, who are responsible for creating the problem in the first place, have the audacity to turn around and tell these countries that they aren’t allowed to grow their economies the way we did, that we aren’t going to fund their natural gas projects, that they need to go green, even as we are importing more coal and building more L.N.G. infrastructure and trying to drill for more oil in the wake of the Russia’s invasion. But at the same time, it is generally agreed that we have to find some way for these countries to continue to grow while also transitioning to clean energy. And it doesn’t seem to me that that’s impossible. Kingsmill Bond at the Rocky Mountain Institute has estimated that in 90 percent of the world, renewables are already the cheapest source of new electricity, and they’re only getting cheaper. I know that’s probably a little bit of an optimistic estimate, but it’s in the ballpark, I think. In a lot of these countries, sunlight is far more abundant than in other places. There are all kinds of health benefits. And so I guess what I’m wondering is, is there a necessary tradeoff here between these countries growing in the ways that they want to, in lifting people out of poverty, on the one hand, and on the other hand, having a green energy transition? Or are there things that we can do either with financing or otherwise to make it so that both of these can happen at the same time?

meghan o'sullivan

I would say it’s not at all pie in the sky to think that these two things can be compatible. I mean, not only is it the ambition, but it’s almost the imperative because energy access and — done so in a climate friendly way — is really the Holy Grail here. And again, this is possible. But there are some gaps that are really preventing it from happening at the speed and the scale in which it needs to happen, both to meet the needs of people in the developing world and to address climate. And some of that has to do with the risks surrounding investments, and we’ve mentioned finance a lot, but the finance piece is huge. And there are just risks associated with investing in clean energy projects in the developing world that don’t exist in the developed world. As Jason mentioned, we need to increase by sevenfold and more in out years of the finance that is flowing to the developing world. And this is going to have to be done through creative partnerships, where, again, as Jason said, mostly private capital, but likely, there needs to be some de-risking of that capital with public money or philanthropic money. So it is basically closing that gap that makes it sensible for more investment to flow there. One point that I think is important when we think about this Holy Grail vision of growth and growth in clean energy circumstances is just the reality right now. Because renewables are intermittent, it is hard to build industry off of sources of energy that are intermittent. And so when you talk about the sun shining and the wind blowing in all parts of the world, that’s true, but we have to have either duplicity of energy sources so there is more dependency, or obviously, much more storage capability, because if you’re going to develop an industry that can be the backbone of development for a country, it’s not just being able to charge your cellphone when the sun is shining. It’s something much more fundamental than just providing certain access to electricity to parts of the world that haven’t had it yet.

jason bordoff

Totally agree with Meghan. It is a false choice to say that we have to care about poor people around the world or care about climate change. And that’s not what we’re arguing. I hear that sometimes, if you care about the world’s poorest, we just have to ignore climate and continue to use fossil fuels, going forward as we have in the past. That is not the right solution. It is fair to say the pace of transition in a multi-decade transition may look different in different parts of the world. I mean, the U.S. is still getting 20 percent of its electricity from coal. So you might think about the different issues of equity in different places and how they develop. But it is also important to be honest about the scale of the challenge and where we are today. So numbers like 90 percent of the world, the cheapest source of energy is renewables, I think there are some optimistic assumptions. And when you look at what’s actually happening in the world today, India is a good example. I give one more statistic that I think is illustrative. India has a goal to install 500 gigawatts of installed renewable energy by 2030. These are huge increases. Last year was a record year for wind and solar capacity additions in India. If you want to get to that goal, you need to take last year’s record number and triple it and do that every single year between now and 2030. It would mean building the equivalent of India’s largest solar park every four weeks from now until 2030. And if they do that, coal use in India in 2030 is the same as it is today because that is what it means to take the most populous country in the world and grow their economy and grow their population. So the challenges of meeting economic growth in these parts of the world and doing it purely with zero carbon energy are really hard. The numbers are really big. And that’s why we need to be honest about it, and not just say renewables are cheaper, so just go do it. We need to work a lot harder. We need a lot more international finance. We need the World Bank to be working harder. We need governments in a lot of parts of the world, including the U.S. administration, to be working harder. And we need private financial institutions to be working harder to overcome the barriers to investment in those parts of the world that Meghan talked about.

meghan o'sullivan

Can I just say one thing, just based on what Jason said? That really fantastic and sobering example of India underscores the point that this transition is not just about solar and wind and renewables, that the world is not going to get to the place it’s trying to go simply with renewables. That there are requirements for many other sources of energy, some of which are more contentious, like nuclear energy. And there’s going to need to be a role for carbon capture, for new energy sources like hydrogen. That, essentially, in order to close the gap that Jason described, it can’t be all done with renewable energy. And that’s part of the realization, I think, that people are coming around to. And that does mean that there are a lot of energy sources that we’ve hardly touched on today that are going to be so important. And if you think about the question of technologies, the I.E.A. says that we have the technologies we need to get to our goals in this decade. But we still need to develop new technologies and their commercialization for the out decades of the energy transition. So a lot of that is still to come.

roge karma

It seems like what you are both circling, in a lot of ways, is that the key bottleneck to threading this needle between growth and greening in developing countries really comes down to financing. And part of my question is why this is so hard. Jason, I was listening to a podcast you did earlier this year with Larry Fink, who’s the head of BlackRock, who, if anyone’s going to know what it takes to get the financing right and the investment right, it’s him. And you asked him how we’re going to get the capital we need for the developing world that we need for the transition, and he said he had no idea. And that was really disconcerting for me. So I guess my question is, why is this question of financing so hard, and if there are any ideas that seem promising, because I think the current theory is like, well, the best thing we could do for the developing world is to invest a lot in bringing down the price of clean energy technologies, like wind and solar. Like, Meghan, you were saying, we’re investing a lot in hydrogen. We’re investing in carbon capture. That’s what the I.R.A. is meant to do. And so by bringing the cost of these down, that will trickle out to the rest of the world. But it seems like there’s a lot more financing that’s going to be needed, and that there’s some real difficulties in getting that financing. And so I’m just wondering what those difficulties are, whether there are any ideas that seem promising on those fronts.

jason bordoff

I remember asking Larry Fink that question, and you mentioned one of the answers that the Biden administration has given and would give. And I think it’s a fair one. It’s not sufficient, but it’s fair, which is, one of the things the Inflation Reduction Act will do, in the same way that the efforts that China took over the last 10, 15 years, again, for reasons of industrial policy and economic competitiveness, to drive down the cost of solar, of batteries, to make it cheaper for all of us to use, what the I.R.A. will do with a suite of technologies, as Meghan said, half of the cumulative emission reductions between now and 2050, according to the International Energy Agency, come from technologies not yet commercially available. We need hydrogen and low carbon fuels. We need carbon capture. We need a range of technologies. If you lower the cost of those through early investments like the I.R.A., you make it lower cost for the rest of the world to pick up. True, but not sufficient. We’re not even making good yet on the promises rich countries made a decade ago to provide $100 billion in climate finance to low income countries. So let’s make good on our commitments. We need more, and we need to think about a creative range of tools. In the U.S. government, for example, it’s not nearly sufficient, but there’s something called the Development Finance Corporation, and they put government capital to work to incentivize private investment for a range of reasons, including some of the national security reasons we talked about before. So you can look at certain tools we have in the U.S. government. We need more of those tools, and we need to allocate more capital. There’s a lot of big discussion going on about World Bank reform now and how the World Bank can put more capital to work to de-risk and lower the barriers to private capital because we have to remember, most of those trillions of dollars, there’s just not enough government money. Most of that is going to have to be private capital. And if you’re looking at a renewable project in Europe, or you’re looking at a wind project in — I don’t know — Vietnam or another South Asian country or in Africa, there’s just different and there’s more barriers currency exchange risk. One of them is political risk. There’s a range of risks that make you more concerned. And I think you want to de-risk those and lower some of the barriers so that the huge amounts of money we need from private capital — there’s a lot of private capital out there, multibillion dollar funds that are looking to invest in the energy transition. We need a lot more of that going into lower income countries around the world.

meghan o'sullivan

Part of the answer to that question, I think, returns to the concepts we’ve been talking about, about harnessing the competitive relationship between the U.S. and China to spur action that is going to advance the energy transition. And the developing world is certainly one area where I can imagine that happening. Like, what does the world look like where China has been the country that has financed a lot of the energy systems in the developing world in emerging markets? What kind of world is that? And what are the geopolitical implications of that world? And are they such that American policymakers and legislators want to make sure that doesn’t develop? So I think it’s getting a different frame around providing financing or de-risking financing to the developing world. As Jason has said a couple of times on the show, this is not going to be done with public money, but it can be done with the help of public money. And so, getting people to look at this more as a critical national security interest, rather than something that’s altruistic or something that makes sense purely on climate grounds, I think is going to be essential to getting the kind of action that will be necessary to try to expedite some of the flows of finance to the developing world. And as Jason said, on another note, there are a lot of initiatives that are trying to look at this. Some of the initiatives that have come out of the COPs of the last couple of years, the World Bank, under new leadership, really trying to ask questions about how do we have to change our lending model or our overall, quote, unquote, “business model,” so that we’re meeting these needs in the developing world, and we’re taking riskier bets in order to advance these kinds of interests in the developing world and emerging markets.

roge karma

So I want to end by looking forward. We’ve talked about a lot of the complications, the tensions, the problems, that could accompany this energy transition. But let’s say it’s 10 years from now. It’s 2033. What’s the best case scenario for where we could be at that point? And what would have to happen for us to get there?

meghan o'sullivan

So when I think about the best case scenario for where we might be in 10 years, I don’t think about a particular metric or temperature point or something like that doesn’t come to mind. I actually have in mind a completely different approach than the one that we’ve been taking thus far, that really builds on the reality that we’ve been discussing, that the world is in a geopolitical moment of fragmentation, of competition, of protectionism. And the energy transition is both a cause and a consequence of that, or casualty of that environment. And so, to me, what a great position for the world to be in, in 10 years’ time would be where — I’ll just take the U.S. because we’re American here — but where American policymakers and other policymakers would think about approaching the energy transition not only as like a goal. Like, this is something — we want to get to a net-zero world, but also to acknowledge that the energy transition and global politics are deeply intertwined. And that what we do on the energy transition influences geopolitics and vice versa, which is really where we started this podcast. So that we would not only have a strategy that would help us get the necessary climate action, but it would be one that would also have an impact on geopolitics and would sort of assuage some of the worst elements of the geopolitical fragmentation that we see. So to think about the energy transition not just as an end, but also as a means to try to address some of these issues. And the best example that we’ve talked about so far today has been that of trade. Maybe we actually get a pullback from this embrace of protectionism because we’ve crafted a climate strategy that demands we have some level of greater integration on trade because it is required. So where you have this kind of beneficial cycle between climate action and geopolitical forces, rather than where I think we are now, where we have more of a downward spiral of the energy transition reinforcing fragmentation, reinforcing a slowdown in the energy transition. So thinking about how we could create an upward spiral, rather than the downward spiral we seem to be in right now.

jason bordoff

Yeah, I think when I look out a decade from now, I do think a little bit about some of those metrics for being on track for our climate goals. By that point, hydrocarbon use would have peaked, and people would anticipate long-term decline somewhere close to the goals we’ve been talking about. We’re so far away from being on track for that today that the question is, what would have to change in order to get on track? And I think we’re going to need a lot. We’ve been talking about the techno, economic, and policy stuff. We need finance, and we need the technology costs to come down. We need the sense of urgency about this transition to go up. And I think when you look at the history of environmental movements or other social movements, they don’t move in a linear fashion. And when we think about the kind of impacts of climate we’re seeing around the world today, the potential for broad scale social mobilization to have its own tipping points, where people are sort of demanding solutions much more quickly, that would be there a decade from now. And then I think that can take two forms. And one form is one where there’s a collective sense to work together to put in place the kind of policies we need and move toward a world of clean energy. It can take a very disruptive form with the kind of severe climate impacts that you might see in low income parts of the world that are least able to deal with this. And then that backlash from the developing countries because of what they’re dealing with and the insufficient funding they have to deal with it, that gets worse. The potential for energy price volatility, and we know from experience that when fuel prices go up, whether it’s yellow vest protests in Paris or uprisings that topple the government in Sri Lanka, there can be a political backlash to that. So these risks of a disorderly transition that Meghan and I have written a lot about, that would be a concern. Either the world is just status quo and we’re not doing anything about climate change, and that has its own risks, but if we start to accelerate the energy transition, which I hope we do, the risk a decade from now would be that starts to take quite a disruptive and disorderly form that increases, not decreases, conflict between countries, conflict over resources, increases tensions between rich and poor countries around the world. And I think that’s why we’ve been spending so much time in our work thinking about how to anticipate what those risks are, again, not to move slower on the transition, but to take steps today to reduce those risks so we don’t run into those kind of challenges.

roge karma

Well, I think that is a perfect place to end. The last question we always ask on “The Ezra Klein Show” is for book recommendations. We usually ask for three, but because there are two of you, I will ask for two each. So Jason and Meghan, what are some books you’d recommend to the audience?

jason bordoff

Well, I’ve been lucky that one of my mentors has been Dan Yergin. And anyone who’s spent their career in energy —

roge karma

Most well-known for being a former guest of “The Ezra Klein Show.”

jason bordoff

He is. I listened to the episode. Dan Yergin’s tour de force, “The Prize,” is a really classic work about the central role energy, particularly oil, has played in global power and geopolitics for more than a century. Lord Curzon famously said after World War I that the Allies floated to victory upon a wave of oil. Winston Churchill shifted the British Navy from coal in nearby Newcastle to petroleum from faraway places like Persia because it was a superior fuel, in his view. But that created a host of new national security and geopolitical and diplomatic challenges. And I think as we mark the 50th anniversary of the Arab oil embargo, this obsession with energy security has shaped so much of energy policy. You really get a sense of that from “The Prize” and the work that Meghan and I do together, is to think about how the future of energy geopolitics might unfold. What would the prize of the next 50 years look like? Not that we could aspire to write such an extraordinary Pulitzer Prize-winning book. The second that we’ve talked a lot about today is about this gap between ambition and reality, the ambition being the urgency of the climate crisis, the reality being that the world’s using more and more hydrocarbons every day, and how quickly or how that might change. Earlier this year, I had Covid, I was in isolation for a week, and I got a huge 800-page history of the modern American environmental movement by the American historian Douglas Brinkley called “Silent Spring Revolution.” It’s a really fantastic book, but what really comes across in those pages is not just the importance of environmental protection. And it is useful to go back and remember how bad the damage was to the air and the water quality in the United States, all the damage we did in the decades after World War II or even before. But also, what struck me in reading the book was how quickly all of that came to a head. We talked about there was a lot of work on this. There was the famous book, “Silent Spring.” And then it kind of all, in the late ‘60s, 1970, and the first Earth Day, came to a head where 1 in 10 Americans came out into the streets in the first Earth Day in 1970 and said, we just can’t live like this anymore. This has to stop. Ernest Hemingway once wrote of a character in one of his books who was asked how he went bankrupt. And the character replied in two ways — gradually and then all of a sudden. And I think Brinkley’s book really shows how history tells us climate action might proceed along a similar course, as we see temperature indexes, combinations of temperature and humidity indexes that are, this summer, broaching the limits of human survival.

roge karma

Thank you, and Meghan?

meghan o'sullivan

I think it says more about the energy reading landscape than it says about Jason and my partnership, but I, of course, had “The Prize” as one of the two books that I would recommend for all the reasons that he suggested. And I think anyone who works in geopolitics and energy, that would be the first one that they would recommend. But let me mention another book or two. So one of the books I wanted to mention was Kevin Rudd’s book called “The Avoidable War, The Dangers of a Catastrophic Conflict Between the U.S. and Xi Jinping’s China.” And it came out last year. And in some ways, it’s not a book about energy per se, but it is a book about this relationship that has been part of our entire discussion, the relationship between the U.S. and China, and written by someone — so Kevin Rudd is now Australia’s ambassador to the United States. But he is a Sinologist. He has lived in China, speaks fluent Mandarin. He’s somebody who knows China and knows the U.S. very well, but is neither Chinese nor American. And it is just a very deep and I think realistic portrayal of the relationship and of the impulses of the leaders and the systems there, and an assessment about how this relationship could become one of conflict, but also a practical book in the sense of saying, here are some steps that can be taken to mitigate those risks. And I think it really does have a lot to do with the climate issue and with energy, generally speaking, because the U.S.-China relationship, both the competitive nature and the prospect of a better relationship, I think, really bode directly to the issues that we’ve been talking about today. And the other book, since I won’t count “The Prize,” I think that many of your listeners might enjoy reading Bill Gates’ “How to Avoid a Climate Disaster.” Unlike Kevin Rudd’s book, which is a lot about policy and geopolitics, Gates’s book is a lot about technology, but it’s also practical in the way it’s sort of empowering in the sense of describing, here are the ways in which everybody can contribute to a successful energy transition. So I find that to be for somebody who’s embarking on this maybe not from a point of expertise, but from a point of potential activism, I think it’s a great book to read.

roge karma

Wealthy nations blanch at accepting blame. The U.S. and the E.U. fear that such compensation could become an unlimited liability. Last year, wealthy nations vowed to provide $40 billion per year by 2025 to help poorer countries with adaptation, but a U.N. report estimates that this amount is less than one-fifth of what developing nations need.

In fact, one frequently cited study estimated that developing countries could suffer between $290 billion to $580 billion in annual climate damages by 2030, even after efforts to adapt. Those costs could rise to $1.7 trillion by 2050."

You can read his fascinating article here.

I spoke to Moises about what he learned in his reporting. Here’s our conversation, which has been lightly edited for clarity.

Are California’s redwoods and sequoias unusual in how limited their habitats are? Or are all plants and animals able to survive only in places where the climate is just right for them?

It’s not unusual for species to occur in very limited geographic areas. Some species are more generalist or “cosmopolitan” than others, and exist across a variety of habitats — the coyote, say, which has colonized New York City and San Francisco and a large swath of land in between — but many others can thrive only in a very narrow set of conditions. All that said, California has some unique environments that might give rise to species that are confined to very small geographic areas in the state.

Is that true because of how vast the state is?

California has numerous and very different microclimates, for instance, such as the damp coastal “marine zone” in which coast redwoods thrive. This region is characterized by moisture from the sea — even though the state doesn’t get much rainfall for two-thirds of the year — and relatively cool temperatures. And then as soon as you cross the hills and enter the Central Valley, temperatures increase dramatically — a totally different ecozone."

But with many Republicans still downplaying or denying climate change, and much of the party denouncing any climate legislation as the “Green New Deal,” it is not clear whether any of this will help Mr. Warnock on Tuesday. Mr. Walker has mocked his opponent’s embrace of climate legislation as folly, with a much-quoted riff on the United States cleaning its air, only to have China send its “bad air” America’s way.

Other Warnock achievements are similarly subject to debate.

In early 2021, Mr. Warnock pushed for and secured billions of dollars for Black farmers in the $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill, known as the American Rescue Plan, only to see it abandoned under legal threat from white farmers claiming discrimination.

The senator was also one of the most vocal proponents of forgiving student debt, and when Mr. Biden finally announced his loan-forgiveness action, Mr. Warnock was one of the few lawmakers to claim credit, especially for the added amnesty for recipients of Pell Grants. But the president’s executive action has taken bipartisan heat and is now on court-ordered hold, pending a review announced Thursday by the Supreme Court. Mr. Warnock has not made it central to his re-election campaign.

All of that has some of Mr. Warnock’s Democratic colleagues looking forward, not backward. “It is not what he has done,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, “but what he can do in the future.”

A punishing heat wave arrives today and is expected to peak over the weekend, bringing triple-digit temperatures to large swaths of the state’s interior. The predicted temperatures — the highest of 2023 so far — are a major departure from what’s been a comparatively cool spring and early summer in the state this year.

“It has been relatively quiet in California as of late, and that’s about to change,” Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at U.C.L.A., told reporters on Monday. With the weather expected to be on the hotter side for the next few weeks, he added, July is “looking like a very different month than May and June did in California.”

The same heat wave has already been baking Arizona and New Mexico. Phoenix may soon break a record for the longest stretch of consecutive 110-degree days ever recorded there.

As the heat wave stretches into California, only the coastal regions of the state are expected to be spared the extreme temperatures. Bakersfield, Fresno, Merced and Visalia are all likely to reach 109 degrees on Sunday, according to the National Weather Service. Palm Springs is expected to reach 120. Death Valley could break its record of 130 degrees."

The hope is that, through the power of architecture, in terms of breaking down barriers, you’re creating a more civil society. The Red Sea projects are about the transition of that society. You will see completely different social norms from the mainstream cities. Architecture is very much about people, and humanity crosses political boundaries.

You’ve pulled out of Neom, but are still working on the Red Sea airport.

I have transitioned from being, with my late wife, one of two architects who founded a practice in 1967. That practice has grown. We’re now a total of 1,800, spread across about 20 different cities around the world. And I now have partners. We don’t necessarily agree individually. We seek to find a consensus. There are wider responsibilities.

As architects, there is no question that we engage with all societies. We might make exceptions on some projects which we think are not ethical. We are doing the pro bono project for the reconstruction and regeneration of Kharkiv, in Ukraine. We were in the middle of two cultural projects in Russia and we stopped and walked away from that, as a matter of principle.

These accusations are baseless. American liquefied natural gas, or L.N.G., is sold in Europe at a price set by the market. While that price is more than five times the U.S. natural gas price today, most of that L.N.G. is sold to middlemen, usually at the U.S. price plus some markup. Those middlemen, not U.S. export companies, benefit when the overseas gas price is much higher. ‌Most of these resellers are not American. The largest are European companies — TotalEnergies and Shell.

European attacks on the United States are particularly perplexing given that American L.N.G. has played such a pivotal role in helping Europe replace gas from Russia, which had supplied around 40 percent of Europe’s imports before the war. Indeed, many European leaders questioned America’s opposition to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which would have further increased that dependence on Russian energy. The United States not only was the largest L.N.G. exporter in the world in the first half of 2022 but also supplied more than three-quarters of the European Union’s additional needs in the first half of the year. Unlike most other L.N.G. suppliers from other countries, whose contracts restrict where the liquefied natural gas can be sold, the vast majority of contracts for gas from the United States have no constraints on their destination, and thus most of those L.N.G. cargoes were diverted to Europe to help with the crisis.

Several European leaders have also criticized the very large clean energy subsidies in the climate provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act. “Nobody wants to get into a tit-for-tat or subsidy race,” the Irish trade minister, Leo Varadkar, said recently. “But what the U.S. has done really isn’t consistent with the principles of free trade and fair competition.”

The new law does have implications for Europe. It will, for instance, make it cheaper to produce low-carbon fuels, such as hydrogen and ammonia, in the United States than in nearly any other place, according to the consultancy BCG. Europeans are concerned this may encourage companies to shift investment plans to the United States or relocate energy-intensive industries, such as steel, to where the cheap low-carbon energy is.

It is understandable that Europeans are worried about a wave of deindustrialization. But the culprit is Europe’s lack of competitiveness without cheap Russian gas, not America’s new climate law. After years of criticizing the United States for being a laggard on climate action, it is puzzling to see European leaders condemning the country for investing too much in clean energy. America’s new climate mandates can begin a cycle of competition in clean energy technologies that accelerate decarbonization rather than lead to protectionist policies that retard it."

Also at the U.N., President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine presented his 10-point plan to end the war with Russia and called for Russia to be stripped of its veto power. “It is impossible to stop the war because all actions are vetoed by the aggressor,” he said before the Security Council.

Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, was not present for Zelensky’s speech. When Lavrov spoke later, he justified his country’s invasion, reiterating claims that the West had staged a “coup” in Ukraine to install a pro-Western president. Zelensky had left the chamber by then and was not present for Lavrov’s remarks.

White House officials dismissed the criticism, saying that Mr. Biden has been paying close attention to the situation in Hawaii and speaking with Gov. Josh Green, Senators Mazie K. Hirono and Brian Schatz. He was briefed at the White House on Wednesday by Deanne Criswell, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, after she returned from Hawaii.

Ms. Criswell said the fires required a “really difficult search operation” that has challenged emergency efforts. Trained dogs searching for survivors have needed frequent rest because of the heat, she noted, and additional canine teams have been brought to the island.

The president’s aides said Governor Green had advised that next week would be a more opportune time for a visit because it would be less disruptive to search and recovery efforts. Mr. Biden plans to be in Lake Tahoe next week for vacation but will break away for the day trip to Maui."

It’s not clear whether the appearance of these cases farther north than usual may be a result of better diagnosis or to warming waters associated with climate change.

The illness, technically called vibriosis, may be caused by infection with several related bacteria. Among the worst is V. vulnificus, which is relatively rare but can be deadly for those who are vulnerable, with mortality rates as high as 33 percent, according to one scientific paper.

The bacterium spreads most commonly in two ways.

When people swim in waters contaminated with V. vulnificus, an open sore or cut can provide an entry point for the organism. From there it spreads, becoming a so-called flesh-eating infection that extends quickly beyond the wound into healthy tissue. Then it may spill over into the bloodstream, causing a life-threatening condition called sepsis.

The bacterium also spreads when people who are immunocompromised or have liver disease eat raw oysters that are contaminated. Physicians warn patients with these conditions against eating raw oysters, which become infected by seawater they filter for food.

Older people are generally at greater risk. The three patients who fell ill in Connecticut were all over age 60. People who take medications to reduce stomach acid may also be more likely to get infected or to develop complications following infection.

If you’re among the vulnerable, wear shoes that protect against cuts and scrapes when you’re in salty or brackish water. Wear protective gloves when handling raw seafood. Avoid swimming in the ocean if you have a cut, scrape or other abrasion that might let in the bacterium.

What to Watch: The bacterium seizes on openings.

Vibriosis causes a wide range of symptoms, including diarrhea and stomach cramps, vomiting, fever, chills, ear infections and wound infections.

The intestinal problems occur more quickly in people who have ingested the bacterium, usually by eating raw oysters. Ear and wound infections will become red, swollen and extremely painful over a bit more time. Blisters filled with clear liquid may appear on the skin.

Symptoms usually appear within 12 to 24 hours of exposure, and people should seek medical care as soon as possible. Tell doctors about the exposure: The infection can spread quickly if left untreated.

“If the wound starts to look red, puffy and painful, or has a discharge, or redness spreading beyond the edges of the wound, you need to get medical attention right away,” Dr. Schaffner said. “Don’t try to tough it out and wait to see if it gets worse tomorrow.”

A lab test is needed to make the diagnosis. Treatment involves antibiotics and supportive care, but surgery may be required to clean out an infected wound and stop the spread of the infection.

Your Beach Weekend: The vulnerable should exercise caution.

Consider avoiding the water, and not even walking on the beach or wading, if you have an open wound, including one from a recent surgical operation or piercing or tattoo. An open wound means any cut, scrape or other abrasion that might allow the bacterium into your body.

If there is a chance your wound could come into contact with saltwater or brackish water, marine life, or raw or undercooked seafood while you’re cooking, swimming, fishing, boating or walking on the beach, cover the open wound with a waterproof bandage.

If a wound or cut does comes into contact with brackish water or saltwater, raw seafood or its juices, wash it thoroughly with soap and water. If you develop a skin infection, let your health provider know quickly — this is an infection that can spread rapidly.

What’s Next: Watch for the infection in unexpected places.

Climate change will test all of us in unexpected ways. Vibrio infection is something Americans living in the Northeast may need to watch for now.

If you have cancer, are immunocompromised, have liver disease or take drugs to lower stomach acid, doctors say you should not eat raw or undercooked oysters or other raw or undercooked shellfish. (Of course, the same is true for pregnant women.)

If you’re handling raw shellfish, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water afterward."

These fires caused elevated levels of harmful chemicals in the local air, although the Environmental Protection Agency says that the pollution wasn’t severe enough to cause long-term health damage.

Train derailments are actually fairly common, but you can see how this one might become a political issue. After all, the Obama administration tried to improve rail safety, for example by requiring superior modern brakes on high-hazard trains, and then the Trump administration reversed these regulations. As it happens, these regulations probably wouldn’t have prevented the Ohio derailment, because they were too narrow to have covered this particular train. Still, the events in East Palestine would seem, on the face of it, to strengthen the progressive case for stronger regulation of industry and hurt the conservative case against regulation.

Instead, however, the right is on the attack, claiming that blame for the disaster in Ohio rests on the Biden administration, which it says doesn’t care about or is even actively hostile to white people.

This is vile. It’s also amazing. As far as I can tell, right-wing commentators have just invented a whole new class of conspiracy theory, one that doesn’t even try to explain how the alleged conspiracy is supposed to work."

To be both compliant with regulations and sustainable, businesses that look beyond building codes for their energy efficiency projects and equipment could benefit from utility incentives.

Buildings generate nearly 40 percent of all carbon emissions worldwide and use nearly two-thirds of electricity in the United States, according to Architecture 2030. An analogy from The Living Building Challenge, a nonprofit organization promoting sustainable design, compares building a 50,000-square-foot commercial building to driving a car 20,000 miles per year – for 730 years (CSHQA).



The growing pressure to address climate change has put a spotlight on energy codes as a critical lever that states and cities can use to vigorously cut down on carbon emissions. As the main source of energy usage in the United States, buildings of all sizes, from large manufacturing warehouses to commercial and residential buildings, public and private companies need to exhibit an energy savings performance contracting (ESPC) approach to make building improvements that reduce energy and water use to increase operational efficiency.



Infrastructure modernization, budget reduction, efficiency, and sustainability goal achievement are some of the key benefits of performance contracting. By partnering with an energy service company, a facility owner can pay for today's facility upgrades with tomorrow's energy savings — without tapping into overall capital budgets.



‍The Catch to Incentives

‍However, there is a catch. Building owners can only get incentives based on incremental projected savings “over code” which is what makes changes to the code standards so difficult for buildings owners, engineers, and architects. While the initial capital expense may be high, the immediate installation cost savings are tremendous thanks to incentives from energy utilities that are available for projects that go beyond the code.



The International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) is revised every three years. However, it is up to the states to adopt new codes, resulting in the federal government and several utilities introducing construction-related programs that encourage better-than-code solutions.



With the exception of low-rise residential buildings, ASHRAE 90.1-2019 has been a benchmark and national model code for commercial buildings for over 40 years. This energy standard has been indispensable for engineers and other professionals involved in the design of buildings. Now with many new addenda incorporated since the 2016 edition, Standard 90.1-2019 has significantly changed the way buildings are built as these new modifications find their way into the world's energy codes.



‍Looking Ahead

‍Utility companies have implemented various programs to incentivize building owners and engineers to build more greener, energy-efficient buildings. Since utilities will not incentivize customers for merely reaching code, it is a company’s best interest to plan projects and invest in energy efficient equipment that go above and beyond the minimum requirements of energy codes to stay ahead of the curve. For example, depending on the workplace and building project, now could be a great time for businesses to upgrade their HVAC systems by switching to clean, state-of-the-art heat pump system for heating, cooling, and water heating needs. A heat pump all-in-one system offers highly efficient heating, air conditioning, and dehumidification. Like a refrigerator or AC unit, a heat pump controls temperature by transferring heat from a cool space to a warm space, making the cool space cooler and the warm space warmer. For instance, in colder months, it moves heat from the cool outdoors into a building’s interior. In hot weather, it moves heat from inside a structure into the outdoors. By transferring rather than generating heat, these systems can be much more efficient than conventional heating and cooling.



‍Benefits of Heat Pumps

‍Heat pumps eliminate the need to deal with bulky room/window air conditions and they offer zoned temperature control to manage room preferences individually.



Heat pumps are also two to four times as efficient as conventional oil, propane, or electric resistance heating systems.



Heat pumps are the most energy-efficient technology available and with incentives from utilities like National Grid, they can provide a cost-effective HVAC solution.



Often paired with renewable energy, heat pump systems can help achieve carbon neutral status, while providing space conditioning for many types of commercial facilities, such as office buildings, hotels, schools, houses of worship, and historical buildings.

Heat pumps provide:

[Read: Can We Save Nature?]

During the second day of the conference, I was part of a group of six journalists who met with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Steven Guilbeault, the minister of environment and climate change. Here are some extracts, edited for clarity and length, from that interview.

At the outset of the conference, Canada announced that it would spend 800 million Canadian dollars to develop four new Indigenous protected areas. I asked Mr. Trudeau how the government could make deals with Indigenous communities that have rifts between members who recognize traditional leaders and those who support elected band councils on development and environmental issues:

Justin Trudeau: Understanding that we need different things for different situations is the best we can do and is, quite frankly, a lot more challenging from a policy level. But ultimately it is the only way that it actually turns the colonial approach that we’ve all inherited on its head and puts them back into control a little bit more.

On who is speaking for them and who is in control: That’s not for us to decide. There are some communities that have resolved their ceremonial power versus political power question. There are others that are still a little bit in discussion about what it actually means. I think we just have to be helpful and patient around encouraging them to determine what is suited for them. And the question of the Coastal Gas pipeline and the Wet’suwet’en is a clear example of a clash between hereditary chiefs and elected chiefs.

We have to try and help them resolve this at their pace and in their way. And that sometimes means taking a good step back and giving them the space to be able to do that."

The initial guidance was issued ahead of more detailed regulations that are expected to be released early next year. Tax experts said it was likely to yield more revenue for the federal government than if officials had granted business groups’ request to carve particular types of buybacks out of the tax.

The department also released initial guidance on Tuesday for a second, further-reaching tax included in the Inflation Reduction Act: an alternative minimum tax on large corporations that use deductions and credits in the tax code to reduce their effective federal tax rates below 15 percent. The corporate income tax rate has been set at 21 percent since 2018, when a sweeping set of tax cuts signed by President Donald J. Trump took effect.

The measure, which will be subject to public comment before the commission’s five members vote on it, would also limit solar systems to 150 percent of a building’s electricity load.

Regulators in other states are closely watching how California changes its net metering program. Utilities and solar energy companies have been fighting over energy credits in numerous states. Billions of dollars in investment and revenue are potentially at stake. More generous credits typically encourage people to buy solar panels but can cut into the profits of utilities."

Take bald eagles, whose population in the contiguous United States has quadrupled since 2009. Or red-tailed hawks, which sometimes nest in city buildings, dining on mice and rats. Turkey vultures are on the increase, too.

“Why are all these other raptors doing great when the American kestrel is on the decline?” said Chris McClure, who directs global conservation science at the Peregrine Fund, a conservation group.

Maybe the problem was a lack of nesting spots, some researchers thought, as intensive agriculture and ever more housing developments meant fewer dead trees in the open landscapes that kestrels need. Scientists and members of the public set out nest boxes, and kestrels moved in."

How’s that for irony? At the end of the day, it might be techniques developed by Big Oil that ultimately help make fossil fuels obsolete.

Drilling, but not for oil

Over the past 20 years, fossil fuel companies have gotten very, very good at drilling.

“It’s something that climate people never like to talk about,” Brad told me. “But the cost of drilling has gone down. The oil and gas industry has drilled thousands and thousands of wells and every time they get a little better.”

By using new techniques like horizontal drilling, fiber-optics and magnetic sensing, some experts think it might be possible to tap into geothermal energy almost anywhere on earth.

“The thing that made me think that this could be real is the fact that the major costs of these geothermal projects often is drilling,” Brad said. “And drilling is not something we have to learn to do from scratch. Drilling is something the United States has just gotten incredibly good at.”"

The post-Cold War era, dominated by the idea that Western liberal democracy and free-market capitalism held all the answers, is over. This was the very ethos of Davos. It must now pivot to the new reality provoked by the Covid-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, the growth of extreme inequality and aggressive Russian and Chinese autocracies.

If the old is gone, the new order is not yet born. Power is shifting away from the United States as China’s military and economic heft grows, but the shape of an alternative international system is unclear.

One measure of a world transformed is that when thousands of Brazilian protesters, convinced without evidence of a stolen election last year, stormed the Brazilian Congress this month, their action felt like a copycat attack modeled on the assault on the United States Capitol of Jan. 6, 2021.

The push follows years of studies by public health, consumer and government experts revealing concerning levels of arsenic in rice cereal and other items fed to infants, including big-name brands like Gerber and organic staples like Earth’s Best.

This problem is not confined to baby-food factories, though. Metals like cadmium and mercury often get into crops as the plants burrow into the ground, drawing in nutrients from contaminated soil — or from naturally occurring compounds. Here are some possible answers to how these heavy metals get into food, what growers can do to keep it out — and how parents of the tiniest diners can steer clear of tainted food.

How do heavy metals get into foods in the first place?

Rain washes pollutants from factories, landfills, animal feed lots or from roadway auto emissions into lakes, rivers and streams. These pollutants can travel through groundwater or irrigation streams and contaminate crops or soil, according to Laurie Beyranevand, director of the Center for Agriculture and Food Systems at Vermont Law and Graduate School."

The blue flames also emit harmful pollutants like nitrogen dioxides, as well as planet-warming gases.

So a team of scientists from Stanford recently embarked on a testing tour of New York City apartments to better understand the extent of the pollution and how it flows from room to room in people’s real homes. It’s part of a 10-city study that is already showing how contaminants can quickly drift into living rooms and bedrooms, sometimes far beyond the stoves that created them.

Concerns over the health and climate effects of gas-burning stoves have already prompted some cities and states to seek to phase out natural gas connections in new buildings, and the federal government has also moved to strengthen efficiency standards for gas stoves. But the issue has become a polarizing one. Last week in Washington, Republicans convened a hearing of the House Oversight Committee “examining the Biden administration’s regulatory assault on Americans’ gas stoves.”"

5. Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture I attended this residency in the summer of 2000. I did not have art education or a degree. I had shown my work for a few years but didn’t really trust that I was a “real” artist. Skowhegan changed all that. I was so intimidated, but the school has a way of removing the competitive nature of the art world. It’s just 65 artists who have been given the gift of no trappings of day-to-day life. Everyone eats together and you don’t leave campus. Over time you become a family of sorts.

6. Rural cemeteries I have always found solace in cemeteries. I grew up in New Hampshire, where there are really old graveyards, and I just loved the oldest headstones with the winged skulls and weeping willow. I loved the images as symbols for life, death, grief. They resonated with me before I knew what they meant.

7. Larry Levan on YouTube Listening to this set — recorded at Paradise Garage on Sept. 26, 1987, one of the New York club’s final nights — always lifts me up, especially while working in the studio. Larry Levan was an incredible DJ. Mixing is an art; a DJ can create a kind of church, a spiritual space. This recording always make me move and ups my focus, while bringing me back to the ’80s nightclubs of my youth. Clubs then were huge, and the most diverse places I have been to, up to this day. It was a kind of utopia based on dancing.

8. Jack Ferver Jack is a force. An incredible performer whose work uses high camp. It then unravels to reveal the vulnerability that the camp was supposed to convey and protect at the same time. Fifteen years ago I saw a performance they did called “Meat” at Dixon Place where Jack played the astronaut Lisa Nowak. The piece should not have worked. It was all over the place, but it held together with a tension that was exciting to witness. I had Jack to my studio, and we started working together soon after that.

9. Upstate New York My partner, Joe Mama-Nitzberg, who also happens to be a fantastic artist, and I moved to Catskill Village from New York City close to a decade ago. We were financially, spiritually, and artistically drained. There is a generosity and spirit here I think that many can’t afford to have in the city currently. Time, space and access to nature are what I need these days. It’s a different experience from when I was younger.

10. Elizabeth Taylor autographed photo Need I say more? This is one of my most treasured possessions. I love Liz Taylor. But I also love that every time I look at the photo, I think of the French Market Place, a gay-owned, -operated and -patronized restaurant and indoor mall in West Hollywood. Inside the mall was a Hollywood memorabilia store called “Dorothy’s Surrender,” where I bought the photo. Not only do I think she was an incredible actress, but I just love that she made movies where she was basically unhinged in the best of ways. And, very importantly, she went above and beyond in her support of people living with AIDS."

In dissent in the climate case, Justice Elena Kagan wrote that the majority had engaged in a sleight of hand. When ordinary legal principles fail to thwart disfavored programs, she wrote, “special canons like the ‘major questions doctrine’ magically appear.”

The idea behind the major questions doctrine is that Congress must speak particularly clearly when it authorizes the executive branch to take on matters of political or economic significance. But what makes that idea a doctrine?

In a 2021 report commissioned by the British government, Dasgupta made the case for shifting how natural resources are valued, and the idea has since gained momentum: Last month, the White House released a draft proposal on what should be considered in a cost-benefit analysis when it comes to ecosystem services in government, practices that draw on his work.

DealBook spoke with Dasgupta about updating economics to account for nature.

Traditional economics does not account for the value Earth provides, Dasgupta said, but instead assumes that ecosystems are self-regenerating and able to offer services indefinitely and that there will be an infinite supply of materials. His report included what he calls an “important new set of calculations” for treating natural resources like the ocean and functions, like pollination, as assets, which, theoretically, increase the chances that we invest in and manage our ecosystems to allow for the production of more goods. “Asset management is a very well understood phenomenon,” Dasgupta said. “But for a variety of reasons, Mother Nature’s assets don’t carry the signals we need to manage them adequately.”

How this idea is applied will vary from place to place, Dasgupta said, but now there is a vocabulary and method for addressing the underlying issues. The Biden proposal, for example, cites “failing to fully account for nature’s bounty” as having led to an “erosion of our nation’s natural assets.” Dasgupta called the proposal “a fine piece of work,” but he said that he wasn’t confident it would be put into effect, or that his ideas more broadly would be understood fast enough to prevent disaster. “We’re in a firefighting situation,” he said. “Extreme weather events are happening even as we speak.”

Dasgupta worries that an important nuance within his work gets lost, even as it becomes more well known. The services of nature are interconnected, and “they can be brought down like a house of cards,” he said. “You remove one card from the house and the whole house collapses.” So climate change solutions that focus on goods and tech, like replacing oil with solar power, fail to account for the full picture — the interconnectedness of everything.

Policymakers often assume that a few tweaks and some human ingenuity will allow for infinite goods and growth; Dasgupta does not."

The program, called Justice40, aims to address inequalities by directing 40 percent of the benefits from certain federal environmental investments toward disadvantaged communities. But the Biden administration, in designing the program, purposely omitted race from the process of calculating who could benefit. The Supreme Court recently struck down race-based affirmative action in college admissions, a ruling that some believe could affect federal environmental programs.

Unless carefully implemented, the program may not work as hoped and could even widen the racial gap by improving the air in whiter communities, which may also be disadvantaged in some ways, faster than in communities of color, according to a peer-reviewed study published Thursday in the journal Science by researchers from several universities and environmental justice groups.

The investments included in Justice40, which span 19 federal agencies, amount to billions of dollars. “This is not just play money,” said Robert Bullard, director of the Bullard Center for Environmental and Climate Justice at Texas Southern University. Dr. Bullard’s research in the 1980s provided some of the earliest evidence that polluting facilities have been systematically sited near communities of color."

michael barbaro

From “The New York Times,” I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today —

archived recording (maria bartiromo)^

And we are counting down to chaos. Title 42 will officially expire in less than 18 hours.

archived recording The pandemic-era policy allowed the US government to quickly expel migrants who crossed into the US illegally. After Thursday, it’s going to be a free-for-all. The Biden administration —

michael barbaro

For weeks, officials have feared that the end of Title 42 would create a crisis at the US-Mexico border that would strain and possibly cripple America’s immigration system.

archived recording Title 42 goes away on Thursday and migrants will be in crisis as soon as next week. It will be a humanitarian crisis. Because we are not prepared.

michael barbaro

My colleague, Natalie Kitroeff, has been at the border and describes what actually happened when the milestone policy came to an end. It’s Tuesday, May 16.

natalie kitroeff

OK, can you hear me?

michael barbaro

I can hear you.

natalie kitroeff

OK, great. We’re just pulling up to this part of the border that I’m trying to get to. I’m sorry. It’s super dusty.

michael barbaro

So Natalie, just by way of context, it’s Thursday, May 11. You’re right at the US-Mexico border. It’s the middle of the day. Can you just describe exactly where you are geographically and what you’re seeing?

natalie kitroeff

First of all, I’m seeing the group of migrants, maybe 300 or 400 people, that have gathered on the other side of the Rio Grande. Crossing the Rio Grande, which, by the way, is not that grand at this particular part of Ciudad Juárez, it’s like a shallow and very crossable stream-like body of water almost. And they just have walked across the other side, which means they’re on US soil. They get off the riverbank and there’s this barbed wire. They’ve been going through the barbed wire. And now they are between the barbed wire and this massive border wall that’s what you might imagine. It looks like a big very tall fence. But they’re on US soil. And so they want to turn themselves in to border officials, some of them to apply for asylum.

michael barbaro

Natalie, what does it mean for the people on the other side of this river who are successfully crossing, to some degree, to do that today?

natalie kitroeff

Yeah, we’re hours away from this border restriction being lifted. And what that means for folks is that the migration landscape in the United States is about to radically change. They’re going to be the first people, we think — depending on when border agents start processing them — to really test out what is this new system. Before, under the measure, which is called Title 42, the U.S government could summarily expel people when they crossed illegally. That’s no longer an option anymore starting later tonight. Now folks who are on US soil are going to have to be processed. It’s going to take longer. Whether or not they’re actually going to get legal status, we don’t know. It’s going to be difficult. The Biden administration has put in new rules. And the people that I’m looking at right now are the ones who are really, we think — again, it depends on when they get across or what’s — what’s really going to happen. But these are going to be the first people to test it out.

michael barbaro

Natalie, the Biden administration has said very clearly over the past couple of days — I think as recently as earlier today on Thursday — the border is not open and we will not let you in. And, yet, from what you’re describing, that’s not really the issue. People are getting in. They are there. So how do you reconcile all that?

natalie kitroeff

Yeah, I mean, you know, it’s true that the border isn’t open. I mean, it’s not as if the gates were just flung wide open and people are walking through. But folks are getting on US soil right now. And the reality is that when Title 42 lifts later tonight, the administration is going to have to process these people one by one.

michael barbaro

But if the policy right in this moment before midnight is to summarily expel migrants who come to the border, why is this group crossing now?

natalie kitroeff

Honestly, it’s impossible to know exactly why any group of migrants is crossing right now. We don’t have any really clear sense. And there’s just a lot of mixed messaging. So it’s difficult to parse the individual rationale of each person. But what we know is that over the last several days, we have seen a rush to the border. And we are still seeing of people crossing today. And it remains to be seen what’s going to happen over the next few days.

michael barbaro

Right, but as we’ve said on the show, for weeks, there have been reports of a surge of people coming to the border in anticipation of this change. Do you have any sense of how many people are at or just inside of the border right now?

natalie kitroeff

So we’ve been hearing that there’s going to be this massive surge today, on the day that this pandemic rule lifts. But the reality is the numbers show that the surge is already here. The number of encounters at the border has gone up to 11,000 a day. That’s up from 6,000 a day just a few weeks ago. So that’s a huge increase. I mean, in effect, this thing that we were all bracing for, it’s already upon us. It’s been happening. This is the reality at the border right now.

michael barbaro

Now, you have been where you are for the past week. So describe what you have been seeing as all these migrants have arrived at the border.

natalie kitroeff

Well, you’re seeing people coming in on buses. You’re seeing them coming in on planes. And one of the most dangerous ways that they’re getting here is on this train that’s known as the Beast. It’s also known as the Train of Death. Because it’s a really dangerous method for people to be traveling. It’s this massive cargo train that people risk their lives just getting on. But I wanted to see what it was like to ride it into Juárez, to try to migrate on this train. So I boarded it south of the city.

natalie kitroeff We’re sitting here among construction material, looks like steel rebar.

natalie kitroeff

And I got into a car that was full of steel rebar and about 40 migrants, who had been traveling, some of them, for four days.

natalie kitroeff The guys that I’m talking to said they’ve seen people killed when they’ve gotten off it and the train has run over them.

natalie kitroeff

There’s not much water. There’s barely any food. They’re hungry. They’re scared.

natalie kitroeff It gets so cold at night. And during the day, it’s unbearably hot.

natalie kitroeff

And they’re surrounded by metal. So during the day, touching that scalding hot surface can be dangerous. And at night, sleeping on it is really uncomfortable.

jonathan arevalo [SPEAKING IN SPANISH]: natalie kitroeff Yeah.

natalie kitroeff

And one of the people I talked to was this 33-year-old named Jonathan Arevalo. He’s from Venezuela.

natalie kitroeff Jonathan said that danger has been with us since we left.

natalie kitroeff

He has crossed the Darién Gap —

jonathan arevalo [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

natalie kitroeff

— this treacherous jungle that was once considered impassable but is now basically a highway for migrants to get here, he spent days doing that.

speaker [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

natalie kitroeff

His friends told me that they had to basically eat sugar for a couple of days because that’s the only food that they had left.

jonathan arevalo [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] natalie kitroeff Yeah. Jonathan is saying his choices were basically to stay in Venezuela and risk his life or leave and risk his life. He didn’t think he was going to survive in Venezuela. So he decided to give it a shot.

natalie kitroeff

He’s crossed into the United States several times already and been returned under Title 42. He was expelled at a different part of the border from where he entered and then bussed to the south of the country. So that’s why he had to take a train all the way up north to try again.

jonathan arevalo [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

natalie kitroeff

And he wanted to try one more time because he actually thinks it’s going to get a lot harder when the measure lifts.

natalie kitroeff So Jonathan has heard, basically, that when the measure lifts, you really could just be deported. I think there’s a couple of mixed messages happening here. jonathan arevalo [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

natalie kitroeff

And so he had been on this train trying to make it one last time for several days. And he basically said, I’m going to walk to the border if I can.

natalie kitroeff And right now, we’re rolling through Juárez. We’re coming from the south up until the north.

natalie kitroeff

But when you’re on the train, as soon as they catch a glimpse of the Juárez city limits, a cheer will go up. People are also still really hopeful. And when they start to arrive to this city, you can feel the kind of spirit lift. And people are looking at each other. And they’re saying, we finally made it. Of course, for many of them, this is, they hope, the last leg of a very long journey. But I think they know and we know that there’s no guarantee that this is really the end of it. And the questions that the administration is asking itself and that we’re all waiting to see is how long that takes, how much chaos unfolds, and whether the system gets overloaded.

michael barbaro

Well, Natalie, thank you for now. And we will check back in with you once Title 42 is lifted and everything is different.

natalie kitroeff

Sounds good. Thanks, Michael.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. So Natalie, when we talked to you on Thursday during that afternoon, things were looking to be at a fever pitch. There was this sudden wave of migrants at the border. The shelters on the US side were full. Everyone had this question in their mind, is this going to basically break the United States system for processing migrants? So what ended up happening once Title 42 was actually lifted?

natalie kitroeff

Well, it didn’t break the system. And it turned out that what we’d been seeing over the last few days, that was kind of the peak. And so when the clock struck midnight Eastern time, I was sitting there watching the border. I was looking at the Rio Grande and looking at this group of migrants waiting to try to get in. It wasn’t getting any bigger. We weren’t seeing a big rush to the border. For the whole week, we had kind of seen people walking with their kids and their belongings toward the border. We didn’t see any of that that night. I mean, it was really calm. From where I was standing, there was a lot of news media. There were a lot of cameras pointed at the border wall. But what they were capturing was a pretty tranquil scene.

michael barbaro

How do you explain that, Natalie, that the worst case scenario for the US didn’t quite materialize? It sounds like perhaps the president’s message about the end of Title 42 — don’t come, the border isn’t open — perhaps sunk in?

natalie kitroeff

Well, yeah, I think a lot of people on both sides of the border think that Biden and his administration were very clear that the new rules being put in place were not going to mean open doors at the border. And there’s some sense that message filtered down into the migrant WhatsApp groups, the Facebook groups, the chats that are constantly spreading that information. And I was talking to migrants in Juárez who were telling me that they had heard this message from the Biden administration.

michael barbaro

Right, because so much of the information that these migrants were receiving and spreading seemed to be that this wasn’t a good time to come because of these new rules that you just referenced. And Natalie, we talked about these rules last week with our colleague, Miriam Jordan. But just briefly remind us why these new rules would have this cumulative effect of making people pause, wait, not rush to the border.

natalie kitroeff

So remember that under Title 42, there was a benefit for migrants. There was a built-in incentive to cross the border illegally. Because if you crossed the border illegally and got caught, you would probably be expelled immediately from the country. But there was no black mark on your record. As soon as Title 42 lifts, that’s over. If you are caught crossing illegally, migrants know that you could be subject to criminal proceedings. And, most importantly, there’s a five-year ban on re-entering the United States. And so the migrants that I talked to are terrified of this. This is the last thing that they want. And it’s really on their minds, this notion that they wouldn’t be able to try to come back in if this didn’t work.

michael barbaro

Right.

natalie kitroeff

And the other issue that they’re talking about is this new set of rules that makes it really hard to qualify for asylum, which is this legal status that gives you protection from persecution in your home country. If migrants tried to claim asylum, under these new restrictions Biden put in place, you have to prove that you requested and were rejected for asylum in Mexico or another country that you passed through on the way to the United States. There were some exceptions baked into these new rules. But all of the migrants that I talked to felt that these new rules made it essentially impossible for many of them to qualify for this kind of protected status. So the overwhelming sense, or the fear, really, was that the new system being put in place was bad.

michael barbaro

Right, which is exactly what the president and those around him hoped would be the message that reached these migrants. And as you have just explained, Natalie, it seemed it did reach them. And it resulted in the averting of a momentary surge, perhaps even a crisis at the border, over the past few days when this three-year-old emergency rule came to an end.

natalie kitroeff

Yeah, it does seem that may have happened at least in the short term. But, honestly, the border is an extremely dynamic place. And people are making decisions based on information that changes daily. And the slightest sign that this new system actually isn’t so bad, that people are getting in, when migrants start getting those messages, that is going to change their decision. That is going to impact the flows. People are not static for long. They are in wait-and-see mode for now. But that can change really quickly.

michael barbaro

Well, so what do we know about that, Natalie? Specifically, what do we know about the people that you saw crossing into the US late last week? What ended up happening to them? And what kind of signal might that be to everyone else about whether this is, in fact, a good or bad moment to try to come into the US?

natalie kitroeff

Well, we don’t really know yet. There’s not a lot of information. But here’s what migrants are watching, and really what everybody is watching. How successful is the Biden administration going to be at implementing its own policy? And, essentially, the question is, how quickly is the Biden administration going to be able to deport large numbers of people? If the Biden administration can quickly deport large numbers of migrants, that is going to send the message that it is not a good time to cross, it remains a bad time to cross, and migrants may sit back and wait. But it’s not a sure thing that the Biden administration will be able to deport large numbers of people very quickly and efficiently. It’s logistically difficult to do that. And if the administration doesn’t do that, what we’re going to see and what migrants will see is people being let into the country with a notice to appear before an immigration judge, basically being allowed to stay and live in the country legally at least for some period of time while they wait for a hearing. Children, for example, will definitely be let in to wait. Families will very likely be let in to wait. And if large numbers are being let in to wait, that is going to send a message to people at the border that, you know what? There is a chance that at least for some period of time, you could get into the United States. So maybe it isn’t so bad to try right now.

michael barbaro

Right, so you’re saying that in this dynamic situation where migrants are looking for any sign that actually maybe it is a good time to go to the border, even a failure to execute these scary new policies might end up undermining this entire program designed to replace Title 42 for the Biden administration?

natalie kitroeff

Oh, it definitely would. And on top of that, there’s this other threat to the new system, which is that Biden’s new policies are facing a bunch of legal challenges.

michael barbaro

So tell us about those.

natalie kitroeff

So the administration is facing a couple of legal challenges to its new policies. The first legal challenge comes from Florida. And it really targets the way the Biden administration is letting migrants out of custody and into the United States. The argument is that this is happening in an unlawful way that puts an undue burden on the local government and the systems in the state. If the lawsuit works, if it’s successful, that wouldn’t be great for the administration. But it’s not really clear what’s going to happen with that one. A potentially bigger threat, experts are saying, is a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union. And basically what the ACLU and others are saying in that suit is that it’s not fair and it’s a violation of US law to require people to apply for and get rejected for asylum in another country in order to get it in the United States. And if the ACLU succeeds — and even if this rule is just suspended while the litigation is happening — that could be very difficult for the Biden administration. Because a big part of their policy at the border is making it difficult for people to get in. And if all of a sudden this new rule that makes it harder for people to qualify for this legal status goes away, then, again, you could see more people getting in and that would reinforce the message to migrants waiting that now is a good time to try to cross.

michael barbaro

So at any moment, a judge could just throw this entire system into chaos and all these signals that the White House has been sending not to come could be turned on their head and the Biden administration will be back to square one?

natalie kitroeff

That’s a real possibility, I think. And it really speaks to this moment that we’re in at the border right now, which is just uncertainty. We really don’t know what’s going to happen. There are a lot of people waiting in Mexico. And there’s an administration that is looking at how this is playing out in the courts and how well they’re able to execute their own new rules. And things are really in flux.

michael barbaro

Natalie, I’m curious, do you know what happened to all the people that you met last week, especially on the Beast, that terrifying train that so many of them take to try to get to the border?

natalie kitroeff

Yeah, so remember Jonathan Arevalo, the 33-year-old Venezuelan guy that I met on the train?

jonathan arevalo [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

natalie kitroeff

He’s been sending me voice memos. We’ve been keeping in touch since that day. And he told me that he was desperate to try to cross illegally before the end of Title 42. He thought that would give him a better chance of making it in.

jonathan arevalo [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

natalie kitroeff

And he told me how he got off the train that day and he basically spent all day and night walking.

jonathan arevalo [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

natalie kitroeff

He stopped for a quick bite to eat and then went straight to the border. But when he got there, he said, they ran into people from the cartel.

jonathan arevalo [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

natalie kitroeff

He said that cartel members were attacking a lot of the people around him. He doesn’t know what these cartel members were looking for. Maybe it was to rob them. Maybe it was to kidnap them. But he’s seen enough danger along the way that he knew to turn back.

jonathan arevalo [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

natalie kitroeff

So he abandoned that mission of trying to get in and went back to Juárez, found a place to sleep.

jonathan arevalo [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

natalie kitroeff

He’s working at a fruit store. He’s trying to make a little money. And he’s now waiting it out. He said he’s looking at information every day. He is looking to see what happens with this new policy.

jonathan arevalo [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

natalie kitroeff

He’s being patient right now. But my sense is that patience isn’t going to last long. He said that as soon as he gets any sign that people are getting in, he’s going to try. He will cross the border and give it a shot. And, you know, it just gives you a sense, I mean, this guy has been through a jungle. He’s been through several countries, several months of travel. People who have done all of that aren’t going to give up that easily. And there are tens of thousands of people just like Jonathan that are following close behind. The numbers of people that are going through this jungle, the Darién Gap, to get here, they are still hovering near record highs. The forces that are driving people to the United States border are bigger than any one policy can control. It’s hunger and poverty. It’s economic displacement. It’s violence. And those things haven’t changed. And that’s the real issue right now, both for migrants and for the Biden administration. I mean, you have people that have their eyes trained on the border to just see what’s going to happen. Because they are desperate. And for the Biden administration, there’s not a lot of leeway there. If this policy doesn’t work out the way they want it to, they could see Jonathan and all of the other people that have suffered and sacrificed so much already just take one more step to try to test this system. And if that happens, all bets are off.

michael barbaro

Natalie, thank you very much.

natalie kitroeff

Thanks, Michael.

Over 20 years, Fayetteville, Ark., steadily built a 110-mile bicycle network of paved and natural-surface trails that today weaves through the city.

Now, the city in northwest Arkansas plans an ambitious expansion that by 2040 is expected to provide entry points to the trail network within a few minutes’ bike ride “from every resident and every rooftop,” said Brannon Pack, director of cycling tourism for Experience Fayetteville, the city’s official destination marketing organization. “If it’s not accessible, you’re going to be a lot less likely to utilize it as a form of transportation to minimize your carbon footprint.”

To help ensure the safety of its growing cycling infrastructure, Fayetteville city officials have turned to CycleRAP, a new risk-assessment tool designed to identify and pinpoint high-risk locations where cyclists and light-mobility users are likely to crash. (The terms light mobility and micro mobility are interchangeable, and refer to low-speed human or powered vehicles, like skateboards or e-bikes.)"

“We wanted to leave the house, but then the flames were behind the door,” a resident told Live Sicilia television. She said she and her family wrapped their faces in wet towels and, looking for a way out, “knocked on the door where there was the cadaver.” They all managed to escape before the coffin and the rest of the house went up in flames.

Things could hardly be worse for Italy and its Mediterranean neighbors this month. Wildfires and successive heat waves transformed their summer paradises into ghoulish hellscapes. Fires in Greece caused wartime-scale airlifts of tourists and ammunition depots to explode. Sicilian churches burned with the relics of saints inside them. And if it was not the heat, it was hail — the size of billiards in northern Italy — as the country ricocheted between weather extremes.

It was bad enough for those who lived there. But the many tourists who had come looking for a summer holiday found an inferno, and there was more than a hint of buyer’s remorse."

Easing the problem of billion-dollar extreme weather events would require tackling both pieces of Christopher’s storm damage equation. Reducing carbon emissions and slowing global warming could decrease the likelihood of severe hurricanes and other costly climate disasters like wildfires and droughts.

One option to reduce property damage, experts said, is to strengthen building codes. Florida did so after Hurricane Andrew wreaked havoc in 1992, requiring that new structures be built to better resist high winds. Infrastructure upgrades — like sea walls to block storm surges or pumps to remove rainwater more quickly — could also help against hurricanes, but only so much.

Some experts have proposed a contentious goal: getting people to live elsewhere. The most aggressive effort to persuade Americans to leave hurricane-threatened areas may be a new program that prices federal flood insurance according to climate risk, dramatically increasing costs for people living in vulnerable places.

But relocation is a tough sell. Americans have flocked to Florida’s picturesque coast, despite its risks. “People like living somewhere pretty,” Christopher said.

There are also political challenges. Florida cities and towns rely heavily on property tax revenues, which leaves state and local officials reluctant to reduce density or to encourage relocation. They can also count on the federal government to fund recovery efforts, giving them less incentive to mitigate future damages."

That leaves Mr. Lula with little financial flexibility to stimulate the economy without causing a new public debt crisis.

There is, however, one area where Mr. Lula could make an early and important impact: the Amazon rainforest, whose health is crucial to the fight against climate change. Mr. Bolsonaro significantly cut funding and staffing for the agencies that protect the forest and the Indigenous groups that live there.

Mr. Rodrigues, who is being considered as Mr. Lula’s environment minister, said the plan was to immediately reconstruct the government’s presence in the Amazon and deconstruct Mr. Bolsonaro’s policies. Mr. Lula’s transition government said it plans to add nearly $200 million to the government’s environment budget next year. And on Wednesday, Mr. Lula is set to address the United Nations climate change summit, known as COP27.

While analysts said that Mr. Lula would have the power to shift the environmental policy on his own — and that the investment would be minimal — how it would play out was less clear. Loggers, miners and ranchers in remote areas of the country are unlikely to give up easily on their main source of income.

In a speech at the Reagan Library in California on Thursday evening, brimming with callbacks to decades-old Republican catchphrases like George H.W. Bush’s “thousand points of light,” Mr. Suarez declared his candidacy with a reference to one more — and to his own catchphrase from a Twitter post he made in 2021 in response to a venture capitalist who suggested moving Silicon Valley to Miami.

“I believe America is still a shining city on a hill whose eyes of the world are upon us and whose promise needs to be restored,” he said, a day after filing paperwork for his run. “And I believe the city needs more than a shouter or a fighter. I believe it needs a servant. It needs a mayor. My name is Francis Suarez, and I am here to help.”

Here are five things to know about Mr. Suarez.

His current job is largely ceremonial.

Mr. Suarez was elected as mayor in 2017 with 86 percent of the vote and re-elected in 2021 with 79 percent of the vote — striking margins made possible by the fact that he faced only token opposition. (Miami’s mayoral elections are officially nonpartisan.)"

Under the new agreement, most of the reductions would be made by water districts, farm operators, cities and Native American tribes in California, Nevada and Arizona, which would take less water from the river in exchange for $1.2 billion in federal grants. The three states, which receive their share of the river’s water from Lake Mead, the reservoir formed by the Hoover Dam, also agreed to make additional cuts that were not tied to payments.

Overall, the reductions called for in the deal would save about three million acre-feet of water from now through 2026 — enough to supply six million to nine million households for a year. The deal still has to be approved by the federal government, and it remains unclear how the cuts would be shared among the states.

California has typically received the largest allocation of water from the river, and we don’t yet know how the pain will be spread among residential and agricultural areas in the state. Southern California is immensely reliant on the Colorado River, which supplies irrigation water for Imperial County and drinking water for Los Angeles, San Diego and other cities.

California is in a relatively good position this year to absorb cuts, because our extremely wet winter left behind an unusually large snowpack in the mountains. But deciding what to do after the plan expires in 2026 will be far more difficult, because the odds of such a wet winter recurring are so slim, Christopher told me."

And most of them are U.S.-owned. Minnesota’s Riverview Dairy company, for example, has a farm near Sunizona, Ariz., that has drained so much of the aquifer that local residents have seen their wells dry up. Meanwhile, some California-based farms, facing tougher groundwater regulations at home, are looking to relocate to neighboring Arizona for cheap water. These companies and other megafarms can afford to drill deep wells, chasing the rapidly sinking water table.

And it’s not just farming operations. Other sectors like mining and the military, which have a huge presence in the state, also benefit from Arizona’s lax water laws. It’s difficult to know how much water is being used up by one of the state’s largest employers, Raytheon Missiles and Defense, which, like Almarai, has a footprint in Arizona and Saudi Arabia. But manufacturing missiles has a water cost, too. And like Fondomonte’s alfalfa, Raytheon’s product is being shipped to Saudi Arabia.

The Saudi farm scandal may have helped to spotlight the severity of Arizona’s water crisis, but the state will have to go further to address the root cause. Arizona needs to apply groundwater pumping regulations across the entire state, not just in its metropolitan areas. It won’t be easy. This year special interest groups scuttled a far more modest effort that would have allowed rural communities to opt in to groundwater enforcement. In all likelihood, if these groups have to pay fair prices for water, they will have to give up on growing water-hungry crops like alfalfa in the desert. This kind of race-to-the-bottom approach to water in Arizona is insupportable today, if it ever was.

Arizona is one of the last places in the United States that should be reckless with its water resources. The state is dependent on the Colorado River, which has been depleted by overuse and climate change and hit extreme lows this year. Water managers from seven states in the river basin failed in August to meet a federal deadline to make sharp reductions. As a result, the Bureau of Reclamation ordered Arizona to cut its use of water from the river by 21 percent. Arizona’s cities and rural areas alike are at risk if they lose access to Colorado River water only to find their groundwater reserves sucked dry, too.

In August, Kris Mayes, then a candidate for state attorney general, released a 16-point plan to stop what it called the “Saudi water grab.” Ms. Mayes, who narrowly won the November election (though results of an automatic recount are pending), has some good ideas. In her plan, she promised to seek back payment for Almarai’s underpriced water and land usage since 2015, urged support for counties that want to manage their groundwater and said the State Legislature should update Arizona’s water code to prevent overuse in rural areas. But she failed to clearly note the action that is needed: groundwater regulation across the entire state."

From New York Times Opinion, this is “The Ezra Klein Show.” [MUSIC PLAYING] Ooh, I’m excited about today’s episode. We’re getting really into the Inflation Reduction Act weeds. But before we begin, we’re doing our quarterly Ask Me Anything. This is going to be the last to Ask Me Anything before I go on book leave. I’ll say, I guess, more about the book leave in a coming episode. But if you’ve got questions you’d like to hear answered on the show, send them to ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com with A.M.A. in the headline so we know what they’re about. Again, send your questions with A.M.A. in the headline to ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. But today we are getting into the Inflation Reduction Act, and there’s a kind of meta point I want to make here. I’ve covered a lot of policy fights, and a huge problem in how policy coverage is done is there is all this attention to the fight to pass a bill — the Affordable Care Act, the Trump tax cuts, the Inflation Reduction Act. And then the bill passes. And if the fight stops, attention just drops off a cliff. Implementation matters, but it’s harder to cover because it’s happening in all parts of the country simultaneously. There isn’t a huge Republican-Democratic fight over it, so there isn’t the conflict that draws the attention to it. And so we sort of implicitly treat policy like it’s this binary one-zero condition. One, you pass a bill, and the thing is going to happen. Zero, you didn’t, and it won’t. But there’s actually this huge range of outcomes in between where the thing passes, and maybe what you wanted to have happen happens. Maybe it doesn’t. Implementation is where all this rubber meets the road, and that’s particularly true on the I.R.A., which has to build all these things in the real world. I mean, we’re not just sending out checks here. We’re building transmission lines and green hydrogen manufacturing facilities and trying to create a national network of electric vehicle chargers and on and on and on. I mean, we’re trying to do industrial physical transformation at a speed and scale unheralded in American history. This is bigger than anything we have done at this speed ever. And so I want to keep on this. And I want to keep on the question of how is it going. The money is beginning to move out the door now, but we’re on a clock. Climate change is not like some other issues where if you don’t solve it this year, it is exactly the same to solve it next year. This is an issue where every year you don’t solve it, the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere builds, warming builds, the effects compound, and it gets harder or, frankly, more impossible to solve over time. Solve, frankly, isn’t the right word there because all we can do is abate, a lot of the problems now baked in. So how is it going, and who can actually walk us through that? Robinson Meyer is the founding executive editor of heatmap.news, which is a new publication that is doing great work focusing on the green energy transition. He’s also a contributing writer to New York Times Opinion, and he’s been doing for a long time now, I think, some of the best work covering what the I.R.A. is, how it’s going, and just the sheer messy, difficult task of actually decarbonizing. So I wanted him to come on the show and walk us through where the law is right now in its implementation process and what are the hurdles, the challenges, between here and some semblance of success. And he really does. He really does. So I learned a lot in this. I hope you will too. As always, my email for guest suggestions, for feedback, and, again, for Ask Me Anything questions is ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. [MUSIC PLAYING] Robinson Meyer, welcome to the show.

robinson meyer

Absolutely. Thank you for having me.

ezra klein

So the Inflation Reduction Act passed last August. Obviously, it’s early. When you’re building big renewable energy projects, it takes some time. But what can we say has happened or is happening? What concretely can we see or we can track how it’s going? And what do we just not know about yet?

robinson meyer

You can almost divide the law up into different kind of sectors, right? You have the renewable build-out. You have EVs. You have carbon capture. You have all these other decarbonizing technologies the law is trying to encourage. Where we have the best data right now is in EVs and —

ezra klein

Electric vehicles?

robinson meyer

— in electric vehicles and in the effort, kind of this dual effort in the law, to both encourage Americans to buy and use electric vehicles and then also to build a domestic manufacturing base for electric vehicles. And I think on both counts, the data’s really good on electric vehicles. And that’s where we’re getting the fastest response from industry and the clearest response from industry to the law.

ezra klein

And when you say the data’s good, what are you seeing that’s good?

robinson meyer

Factories are getting planned. Steel’s going in the ground. The financing for those factories is locked down. It seems like they’re definitely going to happen. They’re permitted. Companies are excited about them. Large Fortune 500 automakers are confidently and with certainty planning for an electric vehicle future, and they’re building the factories to do that in the United States. They’re also building the factories to do that not just in blue states. And so to some degree, we can see the political certainty for electric vehicles going forward. I think in other parts of the law, partially due to just vagaries of how the law is being implemented, tax credits where the fine print hasn’t worked out yet, it’s too early to say whether the law is working and how it’s going and whether it’s going to accomplish its goals. But there’s some very encouraging signs. There’s some things we don’t know yet.

ezra klein

So one oddity about the Inflation Reduction Act, or at least the climate side of it, is we don’t really know how big it is. So — I always find this very funny in a way. The Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation, they scored it. They thought it would make about $380 billion in climate investments over a decade. And then you have all these other analyses come out from other groups. So the Rhodium Group, which is a consulting firm, they think it could be as high as $522 billion. Then there’s this Goldman Sachs estimate, which the administration loves, where they say they’re projecting $1.2 trillion in incentives, which — I can’t even quite figure out what they were saying was happening there. But that’s really a bigger number than 380. So why do all these numbers differ so much? And how big is this thing?

robinson meyer

All the numbers differ because most of the important incentives, most of the important tax credits and subsidies in the I.R.A., are uncapped. There’s no limit to how much the government might spend on them. All that matters is that some private citizen or firm or organization come to the government and is like, hey, we did this. You said you’d give us money for it. Give us the money. Because we really don’t know and kind of rely on these large-scale, national energy system models to estimate what the uptake for these things may be, we don’t really know how many people are going to take advantage of each tax credit. And so because of that, different banks have their own energy system models, their own models of the economy. Different research groups have their own models. And that’s why you produce these estimates that range from $300 billion to $1.2 trillion. One thing we do know pretty confidently is that the initial C.B.O. estimate is probably going to be wrong. The initial C.B.O. estimate, I think, is $3.91 billion, right?

ezra klein

I’ve seen different versions of 380 —

robinson meyer

Yeah, exactly. 380.

ezra klein

— something in that neighborhood.

robinson meyer

Yeah, maybe 369. And I think it also depended on what exactly you counted as a climate —

ezra klein

Yes.

robinson meyer

— incentive in the bill. We know that’s going to be wrong, and we know it’s going to be wrong because the Congressional Budget Office is actually quite constrained in how it can predict how these tax credits are taken up. And it’s constrained by the technology that’s out there in the country right now. For instance, the C.B.O. really didn’t see a very large take up for the hydrogen tax credits. Hydrogen is this important tool that we’re going to use in the industrial sector, maybe transportation sector, to decarbonize and replace fossil fuels in certain uses. Very generous tax credits for it in the I.R.A. The C.B.O. can only look at the number of electrolyzers, kind of the existing hydrogen infrastructure in the country, and be like, well, they’re probably all going to use these tax credits. And so I think they said that there would be about $5 billion of take up for the hydrogen tax credits. Now, depending on other numbers, including the D.O.E., it’s potentially as high as $100 billion, but that’s because the whole thing about the I.R.A. is it’s meant to encourage the build-out of this hydrogen infrastructure. It’s meant to encourage this technology to get built out.

ezra klein

So the reason I ask about these estimates is when I talked to the administration, one thing they are excited about, one thing the authors of this law are excited about, they’re getting these estimates which have some information coming into them from private sector take-up. And the fact that the estimates are going up is to them early evidence that this is going well. There is a lot of applications. People want the tax credits. They want to build these new factories, et cetera. But right now, what we mostly have, to the extent we have any information about it at all, is people applying to get money. And a huge fallacy that we make in policy all the time is assuming that once money is allocated for something, you get the thing you’re allocating the money for. Noah Smith, the economics writer, likes to call this checkism, that money equals stuff. But sometimes money gets allocated, and then costs overrun, and there delays, and you can’t get the permits, and so on, and the thing never gets built. So I want to talk through the road from this money to all of this decarbonization infrastructure they’re trying to build. And I think the place to start is maybe with where a bunch of the money is going out the door. I don’t think people think a lot about who is cutting these checks, but a lot of it is happening in this very obscure office of the Department of Energy, the Loan Program Office, which has gone from having $40 billion in lending authority, which is already a big boost over it not existing a couple decades ago, to $400 billion in loan authority, Jigar Shah, who is not a household name but has become a very, very important figure in climate money. Tell me a bit about the Loan Program Office and your sense of how they’re doing?

robinson meyer

Yeah. And so in some ways, I think you’re right to focus on the Loan Program Office as one of the best places we have data on how this is going right now and one of the offices that’s responded fastest to the I.R.A. So the Loan Program Office is basically the Department of Energy’s in-house bank, and it’s kind of the closest thing we have in the US to what exists in other countries, like Germany, which is a State development bank that funds projects that are eventually going to be profitable. But because of how they have to be financed or because of they’re so expensive or because of the interest rates they need, private capital isn’t willing. It has existed for some time. I mean, at first, it kind of was first to play after the Recovery Act of 2009. And in fact, early in its life, it gave a very important loan to Tesla. It gave this almost bridge loan to Tesla that helped Tesla build up manufacturing capacity, and it got Tesla to where it is today. It received a huge bonus in the I.R.A. As you said, it —

ezra klein

Well, wait a second. It didn’t only give a loan to Tesla.

robinson meyer

Yes.

ezra klein

That’s not the loan people know that it gave.

robinson meyer

[LAUGHS] Yes, it also lent to Solyndra, which, of course, went belly up and failed and became a huge issue in the 2012 election.

ezra klein

The reason I bring that up is not to embarrass the office.

robinson meyer

No, no, no. I mean, and I think —

ezra klein

It’s because one of the questions I have about that office and that you see in some of the coverage of them is they’re very afraid of having another Solyndra.

robinson meyer

They are.

ezra klein

They do not want that, and not wanting that and putting every application through a level of scrutiny high enough to try and make sure you don’t have another one — the Solyndra, as many people have noted, the issue is not that their technology failed. The issue is that China subsidized solar manufacturing so much, it became non-cost competitive. But nevertheless, they don’t want another of those. And on the one hand, maybe that’s good. They’re watching over taxpayer dollars. On the other hand, maybe that means they don’t make loans quick enough. They don’t make loans that are risky enough. There’s a Times profile of Jigar Shah, and he’s bragging in it that they’re turning a profit.

robinson meyer

Mm-hmm.

ezra klein

I’m never that excited when I see a government loans program turning a profit because I think that tends to mean they’re not making risky enough loans. The point of the government should be to bear quite a bit of risk —

robinson meyer

Right.

ezra klein

— the private market can’t. So that’s the meta question I’m asking here. In your view, because you’re tracking this much closer than I am, are they too much under the shadow of Solyndra? Are they being too cautious? Are they getting money out fast enough? Are they getting money to big enough bets?

robinson meyer

You’re absolutely right that this is the key question. They gave this $9.2 billion loan to Ford to build these EV battery plants in Kentucky and Tennessee. It’s the largest loan in the office’s history. It actually means that the investment in these factories is going to be entirely covered by the government, which is great for Ford and great for our build-out of EVs. And to some degree, I should say, one of the roles of L.P.O. and one of the roles of any kind of State development bank, right, is to loan to these big factory projects that, yes, may eventually be profitable, may, in fact, assuredly be profitable, but just aren’t there yet or need financing that the private market can’t provide. That being said, they have moved very slowly, I think. And they feel like they’re moving quickly. They just got out new guidelines that are supposed to streamline a lot of this. Their core programs, they just redefined and streamlined in the name of speeding them up. However, so far, L.P.O. has been quite slow in getting out new loans.

ezra klein

One of the things that I’ve seen in the reporting here — and this should take nothing away from the office. I want to say that the pressure they’re under is very real. Solyndra was a disaster for the Department of Energy. Whether that was fair or not fair, there’s a real fear that if you make a couple bad loans that go bad in a big way, you will destroy the political support for this program, and the money will be clawed back, a future Republican administration will wreck the office, whatever it might be. So this is not an easy call. But one thing you hear from the companies that have gotten loans is this is a grueling process. And the ones who get it speak positively of it, right? This is very thorough. It’s really hard, but it does mean you get both the money and this wonderful imprimatur of the government and this thorough checkup. But when you tell me they just made the biggest loan in their history to Ford, I’m not saying you shouldn’t lend any money to Ford, but when I think of what is the kind of company that cannot raise money on the capital markets, the one that comes to mind is not Ford. They have made loans to a number of more risky companies than Ford, but in addition to speed, do you think they are taking bets on the kinds of companies that need bets? It’s a little bit hard for me to believe that it would have been impossible for Ford to figure out how to finance factories. That just can’t be true.

robinson meyer

Now, I guess what I would say about that is that Ford is — let’s go back to why Solyndra failed, right? Solyndra failed because Chinese solar deluged the market. Now, why did Chinese solar deluge the market? Because there’s such support of Chinese financing from the state for massive solar factories and massive scale. And to some degree, Ford now has to compete, and US automakers are trying to catch up with Chinese EV automakers. And its firms have EV battery technology especially, but just have kind of comprehensive understanding of the EV supply chain that no other countries’ companies have. And so to some degree, I do want to —

ezra klein

So maybe that’s the argument for giving Ford that money?

robinson meyer

I think that’s right; that basically, if we think the US should stay competitive and stay as close as it can and not even stay competitive, but catch up with Chinese companies, it is going to require large-scale state support of manufacturing.

ezra klein

OK, that’s fair. I will say, in general, there’s a constant thing you find reporting on government that people in government feel like they are moving very quickly —

robinson meyer

Yes.

ezra klein

— given the procedural work they have to go through. And they often are moving very quickly compared to what has been done in that respect before, compared to what they have to get over. They are working weekends, they are working nights, and they are still not actually moving that quickly compared to what a VC firm can do or an investment bank or someone else who doesn’t have the weight of congressional oversight committees potentially calling you in and government procurement rules and all the rest of it.

robinson meyer

I think that’s a theme across the government’s implementation of the I.R.A. right now, is that generally the government feels like it’s moving as fast as it can. And if you look at the Department of Treasury, they feel like we are publishing — basically, the way that most of the I.R.A. subsidies work is that they will eventually be administered by the I.R.S., but first the Department of the Treasury has to write the guidebook for all these subsidies, right? So the law says there’s a very general kind of “here’s thousands of dollars for EVs under this circumstance.” Someone still has to go in and write all the fine print. The Department of Treasury is doing that right now for each tax credit, and they have to do that before anyone can claim that tax credit to the I.R.S. Treasury feels like it’s moving extremely quickly. It basically feels like it’s completely at capacity with these, and it’s sequenced these so it feels like it’s getting out the most important tax credits first. Private industry feels like we need certainty. It’s almost a year since the law passed, and you haven’t gotten us the domestic content bonus. You haven’t gotten us the community solar bonus. You haven’t gotten us all these things yet. Now, some of those just came out, but, generally, I think a theme across the government right now is that the I.R.A. passed. Agencies have to write the regulations for all these tax credits. They feel like they’re moving very quickly, and yet companies feel like they’re not moving fast enough. And that’s how we get to this point where we’re 311 days out from the I.R.A. passing, and you’re like, well, has it made a big difference? And I’m like, well, frankly, wind and solar developers broadly don’t feel like they have the full understanding of all the subsidies they need yet to begin making the massive investments.

ezra klein

So one of the tensions I’m getting here with the loan office is a question between what might have happened without the I.R.A., right, “investments that had a little bit more of a sure thing” dynamic and things that are much more speculative, and where the government is trying to backstop an innovation structure or take out the risk of something that might not otherwise happen if they didn’t. And I think it’s fair to say maybe the biggest bet on that is green hydrogen, if you’re looking in the bill. I mean, electric vehicles, I think, would happen sooner or later. They’re trying to make them happen sooner. But green hydrogen is something new, and the size of the bet is huge. So can you talk about first just what is green hydrogen? Because my understanding of it is spotty.

robinson meyer

Yeah.

ezra klein

And then what’s the I.R.A. doing? What seems to be happening? Why is it so important to this bill? That’s a place where I think they’re doing something, they really have a point of view that might not have happened in another administration. Walk me through it.

robinson meyer

Yeah, absolutely. So green hydrogen — and let’s just actually talk about hydrogen broadly as this potential tool in the decarbonization tool kit.

ezra klein

A molecule.

robinson meyer

It’s a molecule.

ezra klein

See, I know something.

robinson meyer

Yes, exactly. It’s a molecule. It is a very light element, and you can burn it, but it’s not a fossil fuel. And a lot of the importance of hydrogen kind of comes back to that attribute of it. So when we look at sectors of the economy that are going to be quite hard to decarbonize — and that’s because there is something about fossil fuels chemically that is essential to how that sector works either because they provide combustion heat and steelmaking or because fossil fuels are actually a chemical feedstock where the molecules in the fossil fuel are going into the product or because fossil fuels are so energy dense that you can carry a lot of energy while actually not carrying that much mass — any of those places, that’s where we look at hydrogen as going. We think it’s going to be an important tool in industry. It may be an important tool for storing energy in the power grid. It may be an important tool for anything that needs combustion. The I.R.A. is extremely generous — like extremely, extremely generous — in its hydrogen subsidies. And there’s actually two different subsidies to care about in the law. The first is for what’s called blue hydrogen, which is hydrogen made from natural gas, where we then capture the carbon dioxide that was released from that process and pump it back into the ground. That’s one thing that’s subsidized. It’s basically subsidized as part of this broader set of packages targeted at carbon capture. There’s another thing called green hydrogen, which is where we take water, use electrolyzers on it, basically zap it apart, take the hydrogen from the water, and then use that as a fuel. The I.R.A. subsidies for green hydrogen specifically, which is the one with water and electricity, are so generous that relatively immediately, it’s going to have a negative cost to make green hydrogen. It will cost less than $0 to make green hydrogen. The government’s going to fully cover the cost of producing it. That is intentional because what needs to happen now is that green hydrogen moves into places where we’re using natural gas, other places in the industrial economy, and it needs to be price competitive with those things, with natural gas, for instance. And so as it kind of is transported, it’s going to cost money. As you make the investment to replace the technology, it’s going to cost money. And so as the hydrogen moves through the system, it’s going to wind up being price competitive with natural gas, but the subsidies in the bill are so generous that hydrogen will cost less than $0 to make a kilogram of it.

ezra klein

Do we actually know how to make and use green hydrogen at this level? Because my sense of the bill is its view is that this is one of these technologies on the cusp. They’re trying to create these big hydrogen innovation hubs that unlike EVs, say, where, yeah, more innovation is great, but we know how to make an electric car. There seems to be a sense that hydrogen, green hydrogen, is something we sort of know how to make, but we don’t know how to make it cost competitive yet. We don’t know how to infuse it into all the processes that we need to be infused into. And so a place where the I.R.A. is trying to create a reality that does not yet exist is a reality where green hydrogen is widely used, we have to know how to use it, et cetera. And they just seem to think we don’t. And so you need all these factories. You need all this innovation. Like, they have to create a whole innovation and supply chain almost from scratch. Is that right?

robinson meyer

That’s exactly right. There’s a great Department of Energy report that I would actually recommend anyone interested in this read called “The Liftoff Report for Clean Hydrogen.” They made it for a few other technologies. It’s a hundred-page book that’s basically how the D.O.E. believes we’re going to build out a clean hydrogen economy. And, of course, that is policy in its own right because the D.O.E. is saying, here is the years we’re going to invest to have certain infrastructure come online. Here’s what we think we need. That’s kind of a signal to industry that everyone should plan around those years as well. It’s a great book. It’s like the best piece of industrial policy I’ve actually seen from the government at all. But one of the points it makes is that you’re going to make green hydrogen. You’re then going to need to move it. You’re going to need to move it in a pipeline or maybe a truck or maybe in storage tanks that you then cart around. Once it gets to a facility that uses green hydrogen, you’re going to need to store some green hydrogen there in storage tanks on site because you basically need kind of a backup supply in case your main supply fails. All of those things are going to add cost to hydrogen. And not only are they going to add cost, we don’t really know how to do them. We have very few pipelines that are hydrogen ready. All of that investment needs to happen as a result to make the green hydrogen economy come alive. And why it’s so lavishly subsidized is to kind of fund all that downstream investment that’s eventually going to make the economy come true. But I think you’re absolutely right that it’s something where we know it is physically possible for many of these applications, but it is not being done at scale, and it’s certainly not being done at the scale of a national economy. [MUSIC PLAYING]

ezra klein

So that’s some of the question of innovation, right, getting the things that we don’t yet know how to build and don’t yet know how to finance into the world. But a lot of what has to happen here, including once the money is given out, is that things we do know how to build get built, and they get built really fast, and they get built at this crazy scale. So I’ve been reading this paper on what they call “The Greens’ Dilemma” by J.B. Ruhl and James Salzman, who also wrote this paper called “Old Green Laws, New Green Deal,” or something like that. And I think they get at the scale problem here really well. They write — and they’re working off of some Princeton numbers here — “The largest solar facility currently online in the US is capable of generating 585 megawatts. To meet even a middle-road renewable energy scenario would require bringing online two new 400-megawatt solar power facilities, each taking up at least 2,000 acres of land every week for the next 30 years.” And that’s just solar. We’re not talking wind there. We’re not talking any of the other stuff we’ve discussed here, transmission lines. Can we do that? Do we have that capacity?

robinson meyer

No, we do not. We absolutely do not. I think we’re going to build a ton of wind and solar. We do not right now have the system set up to use that much land to build that much new solar and wind by the time that we need to build it. I think it is partially because of permitting laws, and I think it’s also partially because right now there is no master plan. There’s no overarching strategic entity in the government that’s saying, how do we get from all these subsidies in the I.R.A. to net zero? What is our actual plan to get from where we are right now to where we’re emitting zero carbon as an economy? And without that function, no project is essential. No activity that we do absolutely needs to happen, and so therefore everything just kind of proceeds along at a convenient pace.

ezra klein

So there are two places to go here. I want to put a pin in permitting —

robinson meyer

Yeah.

ezra klein

— and come back to it and talk first about that question of a plan. So given the scale of what’s being attempted here, you might think that something the I.R.A. does is to have some entity in the government, as you’re saying, say, OK, we need this many solar farms. This is where we think we should put them. Let’s find some people to build them, or let’s build them ourselves. And as I understand, what it actually does is there’s an office somewhere waiting for private companies to send in an application for a tax credit for solar that they say they’re going to build, and then we hope they build it. And I mean, we check up for the tax credit and things like that. The point is not that they just get to walk away with the money, but that it’s an almost entirely passive process on the part of the government. Entirely would be going too far because I do think they talk to people, and they’re having conversations. But in terms of the literal function of the law, the builder applies, not the government plans. Is that accurate?

robinson meyer

That’s correct. Yes.

ezra klein

And you think that’s bad? You sound like you think that’s bad.

robinson meyer

I think here’s what I would say, and this gets back to what do we want the I.R.A. to do and what are our expectations for the I.R.A. If the I.R.A. exists to build out a ton of green capacity and shift the political economy of the country toward being less dominated by fossil fuels and more dominated by the clean energy industry, frankly, then it is working. If the I.R.A. is meant to get us all the way to net zero, then it is not capable of that. Now, what it is capable of is pairing — what we could do for the power sector is to pair E.P.A. regulations that require utilities to do certain things with the I.R.A. subsidies, and then hopefully we get to a place where we have a fairly decarbonized power sector. And I should be clear that I think we’re going to build a ton of wind and solar, no matter what. The issue is that — and we’ve known this is a problem with the I.R.A. the whole time. And I think to some degree, why I keep going back to this expectations question is in 2022, right, we had no way to see how we were going to reduce emissions. We did not know if we were going to get a climate bill at all. Now, we have this really aggressive climate bill, and we’re like, oh, is this going to get us to net zero? But getting to net zero was not even a possibility in 2022. The issue is that the I.R.A. requires, ultimately, private actors to come forward and do these things. And as more and more renewables get onto the grid, almost mechanically, there’s going to be less interest in bringing the final pieces of decarbonized electricity infrastructure onto the grid as well.

ezra klein

Because the first things that get applied for are the ones that are more obviously profitable, the ones that fill a bigger need? Is that what you’re saying, that in a marginal way, that as this goes on, the things you would need to do to go the final mile —

robinson meyer

Become less and less profitable.

ezra klein

— become harder, less profitable, et cetera?

robinson meyer

Exactly, exactly. So I think when you and I look at the I.R.A., we see all these subsidies. We’re like, this is amazing. You’re going to be able to make a ton of money doing these things — building wind, building solar, whatever. And to be clear, most of the build-out that’s going to happen from the I.R.A. hasn’t happened yet. We have a long way to go. I think a ton of build-out is going to happen. The issue is when you talk to solar developers, they don’t see it like, “Am I going to make a ton of money, yes or no?” They see it like they have a capital stack, and they have certain incentives and certain ways to make money based off certain things they can do. And as more and more solar gets on the grid, building solar at all becomes less profitable. But also, just generally, there’s less people willing to buy the solar. They have less ways to make money. And to some degree, solar developers are not really — they’re competing for dollars against any other thing you can do with your dollars. And so as the law goes on, there is this risk. And as we get closer to a zero-carbon grid, there is this risk that basically less and less gets built because it will become less and less profitable.

ezra klein

Let’s call that the last 20 percent risk —

robinson meyer

Yeah, exactly.

ezra klein

— or the last 40 percent. I mean, you can probably attach different numbers to that. But let’s talk about the first big tranche, right? So you have solar developers, wind developers, everybody coming in to get these tax credits. You do have a lot more applications happening now. I mean, there has been a big boom in this industry. When I hear people talk who are implementing the I.R.A. — so John Podesta, who is the former chief of staff for Bill Clinton, a top advisor to Barack Obama, now he came out of retirement to work with Joe Biden on I.R.A. implementation. He gave an interview to Bill McKibben at The New Yorker. And McKibben eventually says to him, well, what are you worried about here? And the first thing he says is permitting. And Podesta has become obsessed with permitting, as have a lot of us.

robinson meyer

Yeah.

ezra klein

I’ve become more obsessed with permitting. Gavin Newsom’s having a permitting fight out in California. So tell me about the permitting problem here. Why is everybody suddenly so focused on permitting?

robinson meyer

Permitting is the primary thing that is going to hold back any construction basically, especially out West, that we need to do to build green infrastructure, because right now permitting fights, the process under the National Environmental Policy Act just at the federal level, can take 4.5 years. And now if we’re trying to cut carbon emissions in half by 2030 as we claim we’re going to do under the Paris Agreement, you know, let’s say every single project we need to do was applied for today, which is not true — those projects have not yet been applied for — they would be approved under the current permitting schedule in 2027.

ezra klein

And that’s before they get built, that process.

robinson meyer

That’s before they get built.

ezra klein

Yeah, that is just to get your reports done and so on.

robinson meyer

Permission to build in 2028. And then, what, we’re going to build all this green infrastructure between 2028 and 2030? So I think everyone is obsessed with permitting because I think everyone has realized, partially as a result of your work, that any kind of infrastructure, including whether we’re talking about highways, whether we’re talking about solar farms, whether we’re talking about large-scale factories that requires any kind of federal input and any kind of federal authority, but also many kinds of infrastructure that are happening at the state level, where states have their parallel permitting processes, it can take years to actually get them permitted. And we don’t have years to get emissions to zero to fight climate change.

ezra klein

Let me not be coy on this because, as you say, I’ve been covering this a lot. And one of the things that has been an interesting dynamic to watch is I would say the rhetoric on permitting has moved at light speed, a kind of speed you almost never see in policy and government, right? Basically nobody on the left talked about permitting five years ago. I don’t want to say literally nobody, but you weren’t hearing it, including in the climate discussion. And now, I just did a column about the Newsom permitting fight. I mean, the stuff he’s saying on the record is very, let’s call it, energetic, really mad at the environmental groups opposing him. Podesta gave a speech about the White House’s permitting principles that, again, was very stark, right? We have to fix this. This is unacceptable. And then you look at what everybody’s proposing here, and it’s fairly modest. It’s “Let’s try to constrain how long a National Environmental Policy Act review takes, let’s try to make it a little bit better to coordinate the process across the government, let’s try to get California Environmental Quality Act litigation down to 270 days,” that kind of thing. And it’s not that these are bad, nor is it even that they’re good. It’s just that on the one hand, people have moved to saying we do not have the laws, right, the permitting laws, the procurement laws to do this at the speed we’re promising, and we need to fix that. And then what you’re seeing them propose is kind of tweak oriented, I would say. And these are tough issues. I’m not saying that I have in my pocket the permitting plan, but it’s a place where it feels to me like the policy is still catching up right now to the principles-level understanding that there’s a lag between the severity of the problem people are now seeing and what they have figured out and figured out the coalitions around to do something about it. That’s kind of my sense of the state of play, but you’ve been covering this in many ways more closely than I have and certainly more granularly. Do you think that’s right?

robinson meyer

I think that there’s two things happening. First of all, you’re right to see that there’s a lag, but I think there’s two other dynamics at play here. The first is that permitting reform is this phrase we all use because we know it takes too long to get the government to give you permission to build things. That’s the problem we’ve diagnosed.

ezra klein

And to say not just permission, but then there’s all the litigation risk —

robinson meyer

Exactly.

ezra klein

— and slowdowns.

robinson meyer

And let’s talk about that in a second because I think that is actually a key issue at play here. Permitting reform could mean a lot of different things, and Democrats and Republicans have different ideas about what it could mean. Environmental groups, within themselves, have different ideas about what it could mean. And one thing — I want to hit this more directly in a second — is that for many environmental groups, the permitting process is their main tool. It is how they do the good that they see themselves doing in the world. They use the permitting process to slow down fossil fuel projects, to slow down projects that they see as harming local communities or the local environment. They use that exact litigation process. And so —

ezra klein

And could you say what that is? Give an example. So what happens here?

robinson meyer

So we talk about the National Environmental Policy Act or NEPA. Let’s just start calling it NEPA. We talk about the NEPA process. NEPA requires the government basically study any environmental impact from a project or from a decision or from a big rule that could occur. It produces hundreds of pages of study about any big highway, any big solar project, any big piece of infrastructure, anything that is happening not just on federal land, but in an area where the federal government specifically needs to grant authority, where the federal government has jurisdiction. That can mean, in some cases, factory farms that use federal loans. That can mean large-scale projects that might infringe on local water, right? Any giant project in the United States goes through this NEPA process. The federal government studies what the environmental impact of the project will be. Then it makes a decision about whether to approve the project. That decision has nothing to do with the study. Now, notionally, the study is supposed to inform the project. And as part of the NEPA process, the government has to consider other possibilities, other options for the project. But the decision the federal government makes, the actual “can you build this, yes or no,” legally has no connection to the study. But it must conduct the study in order to make that decision. Then any outside group can show up with people who say they’re affected by the project and say, hey, look, you’ve made this decision, but you didn’t study this one impact of the project well enough. You didn’t study the fact that it might impact or harm this bird population or that it might disturb this particular wetland. But any actor can show up and say, hey, you didn’t consider something in the study. And the government has to pause what it’s doing — whether it’s approving the project, whether construction has begun in some cases — go back, amend the study, add the thing that the group has raised, and then kind of make the decision again. It doesn’t have to change the decision because of the study. It just has to amend the decision. This is the prime tool. I think one reason that permitting reform is so tough for the Democratic coalition specifically is that this process of forcing the government to amend its studies of the environmental impact of various decisions is the main tool that environmental litigation groups like Earthjustice use to slow down fossil fuel projects and use to slow down large-scale chemical or industrial projects that they don’t think should happen. And so when we talk about speeding up permitting, and when we talk about making this program faster, and when we talk about making it more immune to litigation, they see it as we’re going to take away their main tools to fight fossil fuel infrastructure. The issue is that anyone — not just environmental groups, not just Democratic-aligned coalition members like Earthjustice — can bring one of these lawsuits. And people do regularly against, say, big offshore wind projects, against solar projects, against transmission projects. And so what we’re fighting about, and why permitting is so uniquely divisive and also hard, and why there’s this gap between rhetoric and what’s actually being proposed is that the same tool that is slowing down the green build-out is also what’s slowing down the fossil fuel build-out. And for professional reasons, for earnest philosophical reasons, many, many climate activists, many folks, are very worried about anything that could kind of allow both to happen faster because what they’re worried about is we’re going to build out a ton of new fossil fuel infrastructure.

ezra klein

I think that’s part of what they’re worried about.

robinson meyer

Yes.

ezra klein

I mean, a lot of these groups — say, the Audubon Society in different states has actually just fought a lot of renewable energy —

robinson meyer

Yes, correct.

ezra klein

— infrastructure because wind turbines are often bad for birds. I mean, that is —

robinson meyer

They’re the classic conflict here between the environmental movement classic, let’s call it, which was “think globally, act locally,” which said “we’re going to do everything we can to preserve the local environment,” and what the environmental movement and the climate movement, let’s say, needs to do today, which is think globally, act with an eye to what we need globally as well, which is, in some cases, maybe welcome projects that may slightly reduce local environmental quality or may seem to reduce local environmental quality in the name of a decarbonized world. Because if we fill the atmosphere with carbon, nobody’s going to get a good environment. [MUSIC PLAYING]

ezra klein

I was reading this piece by Michael Gerrard, who is professor at Columbia Law School. He’s a founder of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law there. It’s called “A Time for Triage,” and he has this sort of interesting argument that the environmental movement in general, in his view, is engaged in something he calls trade-off denial. And his whole point — and it’s a very real point and one reason I think permitting reform is hard and one reason I say I don’t have the solution in my pocket — is that, look, you can always come up with the edge cases that make the environmental movement look really bad or make these laws look really bad. So a famous one is in San Francisco. You ended up having around a decade of fighting and over 1,000 pages of California Environmental Quality Act review to add bike lanes, just like an obviously good thing for the environment. It just takes forever. But you do have things where you really are pitting interests against each other, including environmental ones. I mean, if we are going to build out two 2,000-acre solar farms a week for 30 years, that is going to take up land that did not have anything on it before. It’s plausible it will go into the habitats of endangered species or threatened species. I mean, you really will have choices to make. And his view and the view of some people is that, look, the climate crisis is so bad that we just have to make those choices. We have to do things we would not have wanted to do to preserve something like the climate in which not just human civilization, but this sort of animal ecosystem, has emerged. But that’s hard, and who gets to decide which trade-offs to make? That’s the question, I think. But this is a place where one reason I asked about the gap between rhetoric and policy is that one thing I have not seen much of is this is the progressive permitting and procurement. This is the progressive build-out plan —

robinson meyer

Yeah.

ezra klein

— such that maybe the easiest concern here, which is the concern where this will actually be used to add a bunch of fossil fuel infrastructure, we have concocted a permitting speedway for projects that are named essential to climate change. And we’ve all kinds of examples in the past of how we have chosen projects to streamline. I mean, there’s very famously base-closing commissions. And so one of the questions I have had is that permitting reform has been having these weird backdoor fights. It’s like it comes in as a Joe Manchin demand attached to clearance for this natural gas pipeline he wants, or there’s a bit of it in the debt deal where the Republicans want some things. But what you’re not really seeing — not really, I would say, from the administration, even though they have some principles now; not really from California, though Gavin Newsom has a set of early things — is “this is what we think we need to make the I.R.A. happen on time, and this is how we’re going to decide what is a kind of project that gets this speedway through,” whatever. It’s just been very modest, but modest also in a way that doesn’t seem to me to be even really trying to answer the environmentalists’ concerns. Weirdly, it’s been a coalitional fight but not a coalitional process, as best I can tell.

robinson meyer

I think that’s exactly right, but I think there’s kind of two things here. The first is I think there’s a failure on the part of, let’s say, the environmental coalition writ large to have the courage to have this conversation and to sit down at a table and be like, “OK, we know that certain projects aren’t happening fast enough. We know that we need to build out faster. What could we actually do to the laws to be able to construct things faster and to meet our net-zero targets and to let the I.R.A. kind achieve what it could achieve?” So on the one hand, it’s a failure of coalitional courage that’s partially as a result of the fact that when we talk about permitting reform and we’re like, “Well, what’s the progressive permitting reform, you need to give us some options here, you need to tell us what you think we should change in order to make the I.R.A. happen,” they see any conversation about permitting reform as taking away their main tool to slow down fossil fuels. Now, I will say that there’s a few progressives in Congress. Progressives in the Senate have proposed some reforms here.

ezra klein

I was going to ask you about this because there is this bill, Promoting Efficient and Engaged Reviews Act, which Tom Carper, Brian Schatz, Sheldon Whitehouse, who are all climate-oriented Democrats in the Senate, have authored. I was going to ask what you thought of it.

robinson meyer

One thing you see in this law, in that proposal and in other proposals from Democrats, is to basically speed up or to grant faster deadlines or accelerated review to projects that specifically help fight climate change or adapt to climate change, part of the issue is that we’re in this environment where Democrats control the Senate, Republicans control the House, and it feels very unlikely that you could just get “we are going to accelerate projects, but only those that are good for climate change,” into the law given that Republicans control the House. And so part of the progressive fear here is that the right solutions must recognize climate change. Progressives are very skeptical that there are reforms that are neutral on the existence of climate change and whether we need to build faster to meet those demands that can pass through a Republican-controlled House.

ezra klein

Well, you did an interesting piece on the permitting reforms that almost without notice got made as part of the debt ceiling deal and the political economy and what got traded away of that. I actually felt that one of the implications of that piece was it was maybe a huge mistake for progressives not to have figured out what they wanted here and could accept here, back when the negotiating partner was Joe Manchin.

robinson meyer

I think that’s absolutely right.

ezra klein

So can you walk through? So there’s a Manchin sidecar process that fails.

robinson meyer

Yes.

ezra klein

Then what happens in the debt ceiling deal? And why are you arguing the Democrats ended up trading some things away that maybe they shouldn’t have because what comes next then is going to put them much more against the wall?

robinson meyer

So Manchin proposed a set of permitting reforms back in November and December.

ezra klein

And not just him. Schumer has his stuff in there.

robinson meyer

Exactly. And this was basically a Schumer-Manchin bill —

ezra klein

Yes.

robinson meyer

— we should say. And environmentalists call it Manchin’s Dirty Deal, but let’s be fair here that Schumer and Biden’s support for this bill was the price of Manchin’s support of the I.R.A. And then Biden and Schumer — maybe not as enthusiastically as everyone would like, but, again, they’re dealing with coalition problems from the green groups — do go and support Manchin’s bill. And basically, Manchin’s bill is a set of largely moderate reforms to the NEPA process that we’ll describe in a second because most of them eventually pass, but it also includes a number of reforms to the process of building new electricity transmission, which, basically, we need to make it easier to build transmission in order to fight climate change. Jesse Jenkins at Princeton relatively famously says 80 percent of the climate benefits of the I.R.A. will be lost if we don’t 2x the amount of transmission we build per year.

ezra klein

As you’re building all this new renewable energy generation, if we don’t build the lines to get all that new electricity to where it needs to be, that electricity is meaningless, right? Like I don’t plug my car into a wind turbine.

robinson meyer

Exactly. And also, solar, relatively famously, only works during the day. Wind kind of works during the evening hours, when it’s best. If you build the transmission, you build a national grid that lets you demand-shift as the sun moves across the country. So peak electricity-using hours are 5 through 8 p.m. It’s sunniest in the middle of the country when it’s 5 through 8 p.m. in the East Coast, or it’s relatively sunny. You can send electricity. If you could send electricity from the Plains, from the West, to the East Coast, you actually use much less acreage for solar, build much less solar overall, while having the same kind of zero-carbon grid. It’s also much more efficient. It’s cheaper. Manchin’s bill is basically a set of moderate NEPA reforms and transmission reforms. Democrats, progressives refuse to move on it. Now, I do want to be fair here because I think Democrats absolutely should have seized on that opportunity, because it was the only moment when — we could tell already that Democrats — I mean, Democrats actually, by that moment, had lost the House. And so their next negotiating partner by December ‘22 if they didn’t accept Manchin as their negotiating partner or Senate Republicans as their negotiating partner, if they want to do anything on permitting, it was going to be a bill that Republicans at least had more say in determining what it would look like. Now, I do want to be fair here that Manchin’s own account of what happened with this bill is that Senate Republicans killed it and that once McConnell failed to negotiate on the bill in December, Manchin’s bill was dead.

ezra klein

It died in both places.

robinson meyer

It died in both places. I think that’s right.

ezra klein

House Progressives weren’t going to support it, and McConnell wasn’t helping on it, and it didn’t have the support at all.

robinson meyer

I think that’s right. And Republicans already knew they were going to get the House, too, so they had less incentive to play along. Probably the time for this was October.

ezra klein

But it wasn’t like Democrats were trying to get this one done.

robinson meyer

No, no, no, no, no. Not at all, especially not progressives.

ezra klein

The point is not that they’re bad. They were furious at Manchin for good reason by this point.

robinson meyer

Yeah.

ezra klein

To your point about this was all coming down to the wire, Manchin could have let the I.R.A. pass many months before this, and they would have had more time to negotiate together, right? The fact that it was associated with Manchin in the way it was was also what made it toxic to progressives, who didn’t want to be held up by him anymore.

robinson meyer

Yes, and Manchin was also requiring as part of this bill, basically, immediate authorization for the Mountain Valley pipeline, this natural gas pipeline. And I think we should be clear, too, that while progressives were furious with Manchin over a lot of things, this one natural gas pipeline was the focus of their opposition to the bill. Quite ironic because then what happened is the House switched over. We got the whole debt-ceiling crisis. What becomes clear by the winter of this year, February, March of this year, is that as Democrats and Republicans begin to talk through this debt-ceiling process where, again, permitting was not the main focus. It was the federal budget. It was an entirely separate political process, basically.

ezra klein

I would say the core weirdness of the debt-ceiling fight was there was no main focus to it.

robinson meyer

Yes. Yeah, that’s right.

ezra klein

It wasn’t like past ones where it was about the debt. Republicans did some stuff to cut spending. They also wanted to cut spending on the I.R.S., which would increase the debt, right? It was a total mishmash of stuff happening in there.

robinson meyer

Totally. As that mishmash is progressing, I think Democrats start to look at what a deal might look like. And they’re like, well, we want to do permitting, and Republicans want to do permitting, and health progressives don’t really want to seem to play ball here. This is especially in the Senate. So, like, what would it look like to kind of get this as something that majorities in both parties would support, but would be very tricky for any party to move by itself? So what could we get out of this process, both sides? And there is off-the-record meetings. There’s just a slow negotiation process where, basically, as part of this debt ceiling deal, you might get some NEPA reforms, and you might get some transmission reforms. That alchemy goes into the final debt-ceiling negotiations, which are between principals in Congress and the White House, and what we get is a set of basically the NEPA reforms in Joe Manchin’s bill from last year and the Mountain Valley pipeline, the thing that environmentalists were focused on blocking, and effectively no transmission reforms. Let’s say the set of NEPA reforms that were just enacted, that are now in the law, include — basically, the word reasonable has been inserted many times into NEPA. [LAUGHS] So the law, instead of saying the government has to study all environmental impacts, now it has to study reasonable environmental impacts. It also — and this is a kind of climate win — has to study the environmental impacts that could result from not doing a project. The kind of average NEPA environmental impact study today is 500 pages and takes 4.5 years to produce. Under the law now, the government is supposed to hit a page limit of 150 to 300 pages.

ezra klein

I feel like people think this is going to make things easier, but I’m a writer, and it’s not necessarily quicker to write shorter.

robinson meyer

Yes, exactly. And it also has to get the easiest NEPA reviews done in one year and the hardest NEPA reviews done in two years. And if the government agency hasn’t made a decision in two years, then kind of the sponsor, the applicant for the project, can sue the agency and get a court to give them a decision. It’s not as far as Republicans wanted. Republicans actually wanted to make the law that if an agency went over the NEPA process, that if it passed a deadline, that immediately the project would be approved irrevocably, and no court could review it. What emerged was that now you can sue an agency and kind of get an accelerated result.

ezra klein

One, I think, reasonable critique you hear on this from Democrats or from the left or from someone is that if you want to have all of these reviews happening, and you want them faster, and we’re rapidly expanding build-out, then what you need is a lot more personnel. And this doesn’t do that. This does not create a huge pot of money for the supply —

robinson meyer

No.

ezra klein

— of people who are going to conduct environmental impact reports to increase and to get even better recruitment into that sector of the economy, right? You’re demanding faster, but you’re not really increasing capacity that much.

robinson meyer

Exactly. And I think if there were two progressive requirements for these negotiations, one was expanding the number of staff that are working on this and making it more of a staffing issue. And there’s a study that’s very well cited by progressives from three professors in Utah who basically say, well, when you look at the National Forest Service, and you look at this 40,000 NEPA decisions, what mostly holds up these NEPA decisions is not like, oh, there’s too many requirements or they had to study too many things that don’t matter. It’s just there wasn’t enough staff and that staffing is primarily the big impediment. And so on the one hand, I think that’s probably accurate in that these are, in some cases — the beast has been starved, and these are very poorly staffed departments. I think on the other hand, this did wind up being for progressives a way to get around the conversation that we were just saying they’re not having, where the main progressive demand was not “where can we streamline NEPA, what are we willing to accept here in the changes to the law?” The main progressive demand was just “we must staff it better.”

ezra klein

If you stare at this for too long, you will lose your mind, right? To the point of all this, I mean, as you’re suggesting, I don’t really like that study. For instance, the most common form of NEPA report is not an environmental impact statement, which is the one people kind of think of to the extent that they think of anything. It’s a categorical exclusion statement, which is to basically say this is the kind of project that does not need a NEPA review. And that is partially a staffing problem. But if it’s taking you this much staffing and that much time to say something doesn’t apply to you, maybe you have a process problem —

robinson meyer

Yes.

ezra klein

— and you shouldn’t just throw endless resources at a broken process, which brings me — because, again, you can fall into this and never get out — I think, to the bigger critique here. I had mentioned earlier this draft law paper I’ve been reading called “The Greens’ Dilemma” by Ruhl and Salzman. And NEPA gets a lot of attention here in California. Its cousin, the California Environmental Quality Act, gets a lot of attention. But one of their points is that these bills are almost symbolic because there’s so much else happening, and it’s really the way all this interlocks and the number of possible choke points, that if you touch one of them or even you streamline one of them, it doesn’t necessarily get you that far. So they write, quote, “All told, over 60 federal permitting programs operate in the infrastructure approval regime, and that is just the federal system. State and local approvals and impact assessments could also apply to any project.” So their view is that under this system, it’s simply not possible to build the amount of decarbonization infrastructure we need at the pace we need it; that no amount of streamlining NEPA or streamlining, in California, CEQA will get you there; that we basically have been operating under what they call an environmental grand bargain dating back to the ‘70s, where we built all of these processes to slow things down and to clean up the air and clean up the water. And we accepted this trade-off of slower building, quite a bit slower building, for a cleaner environment. And that was a good trade. It was addressing the problems of that era. And now we have the problems of this era, which is we need to unbelievably, rapidly build out decarbonization infrastructure to keep the climate from warming more than we can handle and that we just don’t have a legal regime or anything. You would need to do a whole new grand bargain for this era. And I’ve not seen that many people say that, but it seems true to me. And I’m curious if you think they’re right.

robinson meyer

I think they are right, and I think I would make two broad observations. One aspect of the environmental grand bargain of the ‘70s that we don’t talk about as much or that I think fits into this is that it was actually part of a much larger set of decisions that were happening in the ‘70s across the government and across American society that were dealing with the fact that American manufacturing was really no longer cost competitive, that the role that America had played in the global economy in the ‘50s and ‘60s where we had a ton of manufacturing, where we were kind of the factory to a world rebuilding from World War II, was no longer tenable and that, also, we wanted to focus on more of these kind of high-wage, what we would now call knowledge economy jobs. That was a large economic transition happening in the ‘70s and ‘80s, and it dovetailed really nicely with the environmental grand bargain. Today, we’re in a place where American policymakers and Americans generally in both parties are not as sure that was the right choice, and they’re certainly not as sure that that is the right stance for the US to have if we’re facing this kind of decades-long competition with China and that, more broadly, there were good parts of the economy that that moment built, and there were bad parts. At some point, the I.R.A. recognizes that that environmental grand bargain is no longer operative, right, because it says, we’re going to build all this big fiscal fixed infrastructure in the United States, we’re going to become a manufacturing giant again, but there has not been a recognition among either party of what exactly that will mean and what will be required to have it take hold. And I want to give an example here about one particular technology, which is carbon capture, and how we’re seeing a Grand Bargain get hashed out, but right now there’s no one actor or no one party that can be as serious about this as it needs to be. The Supreme Court has said — it ruled last year — that basically the E.P.A. can’t generation shift. It can’t require utilities to change the kind of fossil fuel they’re burning or what they’re doing to meet climate change requirements under the Clean Air Act; that if the E.P.A. wants to treat carbon pollution as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act and keep power plants from emitting it, it can’t say, well, just shut down your coal plants, shut down your natural gas plants, and build a ton of renewables. It must require a form of on-the-ground, inside-the-fenceline, “at the site of the power plant” pollution control technology. The only way to do that, really, is by requiring carbon capture and requiring the large construction of major industrial infrastructure at many, many coal plants and natural gas plants around the country in order to capture carbon so it doesn’t enter the atmosphere, and so we don’t contribute to climate change. That is what the Supreme Court has ruled. Until that body changes, that is going to be the law. So the E.P.A. has now, last month, proposed a new rule under the Clean Air Act that is going to require coal plants and some natural gas plants to install carbon capture technology to do basically what the Supreme Court has all but kind of required the E.P.A. to do. I don’t think that rule is strong enough. I think it could be stronger. We can get into that. But the E.P.A. has to demonstrate, in order to kind of make this rule the law and in order to make this rule pass muster with the Supreme Court, that this is tenable, that this is the best available and technologically feasible option. And that means you actually have to allow carbon capture facilities to get built and you have to create a legal process that will allow carbon capture facilities to get built. And that means you need to be able to tell a power plant operator that if they capture carbon, there’s a way they can inject it back into the ground, the thing that they’re supposed to do with it. Well, E.P.A. simultaneously has only approved the kind of well that you need to inject carbon that you’ve captured from a coal factory or a natural gas line back into the ground. It’s called a Class 6 well. The E.P.A. has only ever approved two Class 6 wells. It takes years for the E.P.A. to approve a Class 6 well. And environmental justice groups really, really oppose these Class 6 wells because they see any carbon capture as an effort to extend the life of the fossil fuel infrastructure. And in fact, in Louisiana, you see many environmental groups, including Earthjustice, opposing an effort by the Democratic governor of Louisiana to expedite Class 6 well approval while holding what Class 6 wells are actually required to do to a higher standard than the E.P.A. itself would require. The issue here is that it seems like C.C.S., carbon capture, is going to be essential to how the U.S. decarbonizes. Legally, we have no other choice because of the constraints the Supreme Court has placed on the E.P.A.. At the same time, environmental justice groups, and big green groups to some extent, oppose building out any C.C.S. And so on the one hand, there’s a technology we must build in order to decarbonize. On the other hand, no of the actually existing environmental groups want to see that technology get approved. And they’re fighting any effort. Whether open or kind of sub-rosa, they’re fighting any effort to streamline and make it possible to build Class 2 wells, to build C.C.S. There is a deep logical disconnect there between —

ezra klein

Well, it’s not a logical disconnect because they would say — to be fair to them, right, they would say there are other ways to decarbonize. That may not be the way we’ve chosen because the politics weren’t there for it, but there are a lot of these groups that believe you could have 100 percent renewables, do not use all that much carbon capture, right? They would have liked to see a different decarbonization path taken too. I’m not sure that path is realistic.

robinson meyer

I think that’s right, but I also want to say here that —

ezra klein

But that is what you hear.

robinson meyer

— in some ways, I also want to differentiate here between, let’s say, an effort to block any one individual C.C.S. project and an effort to stop the entire apparatus of approving and constructing C.C.S. projects across the country, because an effort to stop any one C.C.S. project to some degree, that might be part of a new grand bargain where, basically, we say, you can do C.C.S., but it’s really hard to get a project approved. That’s a little different from what the E.P.A. will need to do legally in order to finally pass muster and get Clean Air Act rules past the Supreme Court, which is to say it is possible to build a C.C.S. project anywhere in the country. So what you do see are environmental groups opposing making it possible to build C.C.S. anywhere in the country at all.

ezra klein

Right. I’m not arguing that.

robinson meyer

No, totally.

ezra klein

The only point I’m making here is I think this is where you see a compromise a lot of them didn’t want to make —

robinson meyer

Exactly, yeah.

ezra klein

— which is a decarbonization strategy that actually does extend the life cycle of a lot of fossil fuel infrastructure using carbon capture. And because they never bought onto it, they’re still using the pathway they have to try to block it. The problem is that’s part of the path that’s now been chosen. So if you block it, you just don’t decarbonize. It’s not like you get the 100 percent renewable strategy.

robinson meyer

Exactly. The bargain that will emerge from that set of actions and that set of coalitional trade-offs is we will simply keep running this, and we will not cap it.

ezra klein

Right.

robinson meyer

And I want to be also clear here that I understand where they are. I understand why these demands of these groups are what they are. Let’s be really clear. If there was a petrochemical refinery in the middle of Washington, D.C., I don’t think there’d be a lot of national support for keeping a lot of petrochemical refineries open, right? And I don’t think I would be very enthusiastic about the idea. That being said, the rhetoric you sometimes see from these groups is that C.C.S. is a false solution, that it will not actually fight climate change. That is preventing the environmental movement from calling industry’s bluff here because industry says, oh, we need C.C.S. to decarbonize. What could be possible is that progressives and Democrats and the E.P.A. turns around and says, “Oh, that’s fine. You can do C.C.S. You just have to cap every single stationary source in the country.” Like, “You want to do C.C.S.? We totally agree. Essential. You must put CSS infrastructure on every power plant, on every factory that burns fossil fuels, on everything.” If progressives were to do that and were to get it into the law — and there’s nothing the Supreme Court has said, by the way, that would limit progressives from doing that — the upshot would be we shut down a ton more stationary sources and a ton more petrochemical refineries and these bad facilities that groups don’t want than we would under the current plan. But because it is coalitionally uncomfortable to turn around and say, “Oh, sure you want C.C.S.? You can do C.C.S. You just have to put it on everything,” what is effectively going to happen is that way more factories and power plants stay open and uncapped than would be otherwise.

ezra klein

So for obvious coalitional reasons, the dynamics we are talking about here at the state level are stronger in blue states, where you have strong environmental movements that then interact with Democratic governments. I mean, even the example you gave of Louisiana, you do at least have a Democratic governor there.

robinson meyer

Yeah. One reason why Louisiana is so important is because Texas will probably also apply for this process and, because Texas has a Republican administration right now, that process will probably be easier and more lax than Louisiana would be.

ezra klein

Well, this is what I’m about to get to. So something really interesting is emerging with where the money is going.

robinson meyer

Yeah.

ezra klein

So Republican-controlled states are just on track to get a lot more of it. So the Rocky Mountain Institute estimates that red states will get $623 billion in investments by 2030 compared to $354 billion for blue states. Gavin Newsom, Governor Gavin Newsom, in an interview with me recently was complaining about how — the word he used was indignant. He’s like, I’m indignant to see these red states that have fought these policies every step of the way getting this money. So I know there are a number of reasons here, and I want to get into some of the red-state politics here. But just at the high level, why are red states getting so much more of this money?

robinson meyer

I think there’s two reasons. I think, first of all, red states have been more enthusiastic about getting the money. They’re the ones giving away the tax credits. They have a business-friendly environment. And ultimately, the way many, many of these red-state governors see it is that these are just businesses. And, yeah, they may be doing something that at the national level we don’t think we should be subsidizing, but we’re happy to help you come to our state and contribute to our state’s business environment, and we’ll —

ezra klein

When you say they’re giving away the money —

robinson meyer

— subsidize it.

ezra klein

— what do you mean? It’s the Federal government who gives away the money.

robinson meyer

In some cases, there is local tax benefits or there’s local incentives, write-off. You get discounts, basically, on your local business taxes, local property taxes, if you come in as a large industrial producer. I think the other thing is that these states, many of them, are right-to-work states. And so they might pay their workers less. They certainly face much less risk financially from a unionization campaign in their state. And so frankly, one reason that red states are getting a lot of this money to support the new construction of heavy industry and manufacturing is that regardless of the I.R.A., that’s where manufacturing and industrial investment goes in the first place. And that’s where it’s been going for 20 years because of the set of business-friendly and local subsidies and right-to-work policies.

ezra klein

So the private companies that are applying for this money like to locate in the red states —

robinson meyer

Yes, exactly.

ezra klein

— because the climate for them is simpler. And there were a lot of provisions in the bill that were trying to have higher labor standards to the extent that a right-to-work state is an advantage in this. I mean, you can make the argument from, again, triaging trade-offs to get decarbonization, but that’s not the argument this bill made, right? That is not what the Biden administration wanted. Biden brags about being the most pro-union president in American history. So are those labor standards that they thought were going to be so potent, where you get more money and credits for better jobs, are those not proving effective?

robinson meyer

I think there’s two things going on here, and I think, to some degree, the law is actually a little undecided. If we can ascribe intentionality to the law, I think the law is a little undecided about what’s happening here.

ezra klein

If you created a large language model —

robinson meyer

Yes, exactly. [LAUGHS]

ezra klein

— trained off of the I.R.A. and had it answer questions for you.

robinson meyer

On the one hand, I think the administration wants to see as many of these be union jobs as possible. And what it’s been able to do in the I.R.A. is require the construction jobs for these factories to be unionized or to be effectively unionized to receive union wages. It can’t always require that the workers who then work in the factories are actually part of unions. That’s one thing. And I think the administration would say, we want this to be a big union-led effort. We want it to go to the Great Lakes states that are our political firewall. At the same time, I think the other thing happening here and, I think, the other thing that, to some degree, the people who shaped the law knew would happen is that a ton of this investment would go to red states, and it would go to red states, because that’s where private industry has been locating since the ‘70s and ‘80s, and it would go to the Southeast, right, and the Sunbelt, and that that wouldn’t be so bad because then you would get a dynamic where red-state senators, red-state representatives, red-state governors would want to support the transition further and would certainly not support the repeal of the I.R.A. provisions and the repeal of climate provisions, and that you’d get this kind of nice vortex of the investment goes to red states, red states feel less antagonistic toward climate policies, more investment goes to red states. Red-state governors might even begin to support environmental regulation because that basically locks in benefits and advantages to the companies located in their states already. And so I think to some degree, there was a little bit of hazy thinking about what exactly was going to happen here, because, on the one hand, I think there was a hope that these would be unionized jobs. And on the other hand, I think anyone looking at the landscape of where large-scale corporate investment was going in the 2000s and the 2010s would see that it was going to go to Georgia, would see that it was gonna go to red states, and hope that by making clean investment there that you might dislodge some of the Republican opposition to climate policies.

ezra klein

So red states can sound like one class of thing, but they’re not on this. So you mentioned Georgia. Georgia’s been getting a lot of investment here, and Kemp, the Republican governor of Georgia, has been very excited about it, has talked it up. They’re really open for I.R.A. business. And then we mentioned Texas. And in Texas, there’s been a raft of laws proposed — some of them passing, some of them not — that are basically making renewable energy harder to build in Texas, that are trying to make Texas more of an oil and gas state. You’ve seen the governor of Texas, after there were huge blackouts because the gas system failed, blaming renewables for this somehow and trying to make it easier to build natural gas infrastructure. So I think one of the possible failure modes here is that instead of the red states actually getting a lot of investment, they turn against it as woke capital or government E.S.G. or something and begin to make it harder to do in the way they basically walled themselves off from the Medicaid money in Obamacare. How do you see that playing out?

robinson meyer

It’s worth kind of splitting this into two different categories. On the one hand, what you see in Texas is, yes, this kind of anti-E.S.G. backlash, though maybe that’s now going away, this rejection of making decisions in the market based on anything other than what are supposedly the hardest of market fundamentals. You also see rejection of renewables and a rejection of clean electricity generation. I would kind of divide clean electricity generation renewables from EVs. I guess what I’d say generally is what you see is that EV investment is generally welcomed by Georgia, by Tennessee, by Kentucky, by Texas. There’s a big Tesla —

ezra klein

I mean, Elon Musk lives in Texas now.

robinson meyer

Exactly, exactly. So I think what you see is that Republicans are increasingly warming to EV investment, and it’s actually building out renewables and actually building out clean electricity generation, where you see them fighting harder.

ezra klein

And how much has the permitting differences mattered here? Because, I mean, this is an argument Newsom is making in California for his permitting reforms, which are fairly modest, but there’s still a big fight there. They point to Jennifer Granholm, the secretary of energy, giving this speech in California where she’s basically asked, how can California get more of this money? Why isn’t it getting more of this money? And she says, look, these other states are coming to me and saying, we did permitting reform. We have made it easier to build in such and such state. She’s like, if California can make it easier to build here — she’s like, I can’t tell you where the money will go. We’re agnostic. But that would definitely be helpful in getting manufacturing to relocate here, and this money would flow towards the manufacturing.

robinson meyer

I think permitting is really important in two ways. I think, first of all, it’s important in the approval of the factories themselves, in the approval of the infrastructure itself, and simply easier to build in states. In many states, you have to deal with the NEPA process. In California, you have to deal with NEPA and this E.Q.A. process, right, which is basically a parallel state level NEPA process. The other way that permitting matters — and this gets into the broader reason why private investment was generally going to red states and generally going to the Sunbelt — is that the Sunbelt states — Georgia, Texas — it’s easier to be there as a company because housing costs are lower and because the cost of living is lower in those states. And why is the cost of living lower in those states? Because they’re surrounded by big, sprawling — the cities are surrounded by big suburban sprawl, where it’s very cheap to build and it’s very cheap to live as someone who might work at those factories. And so the big story in the American economy for the past 50 years or something, 40 years, has been the growth of the Sunbelt and the relocation of people in the North to the South. That’s partially because of local permitting laws. And there are cities you can point to in the Sunbelt that have better permitting. But it’s also partially because the Sunbelt and the Southeast, it was like the last part of the country to develop, frankly, and there’s just a ton more land around all the cities, and so you can get away with the sprawling suburban growth model in those cities. They’re still, I don’t know, alpha there. It’s just cheaper to keep building suburbs there.

ezra klein

There’s one other area, before we wrap up, of problem emerging, I think, that I want to talk about, which is basically the supply chain for all of this. And we have become much more antagonistic, ambivalent towards China. China has a lot of the supply chain for renewable energy, for batteries, et cetera. They got a lot of lithium and cobalt and so on, and they’ve bought up a lot of the supply chain in other places for that. And when I say the supply chain here, actually, primarily, I’m talking about the actual mining and manufacturing of these materials. If we want to make all these EVs, if we want to make all these solar panels, we need a lot of, basically, resource extraction from the Earth. Solar panels need chemicals to function. And when you say, look, this environmental group is fighting this solar array, people are like, [SIGHS] environmental groups, you know? But when you say they’re fighting a giant lithium extraction site, I mean, people don’t want to live near a lithium extraction site.

robinson meyer

Yeah.

ezra klein

And we’re going to need a lot of lithium extraction sites. And there are ways in which this whole new clean energy world, not all of it is clean and not all of it is gentle, peaceful, decentralized, right? It’s not all the small Earth model.

robinson meyer

We can’t fight climate change, we can’t decarbonize, we can’t reach net zero with everyone having rooftop solar.

ezra klein

So how are you seeing the fights over these rare-earth metals and the effort to build a safe and, if not domestic, kind of friend-shored supply chain there?

robinson meyer

Let’s talk three different aspects of this. The first is what is the process like to actually build new mines in the United States? Are we going to be able to source some of these minerals from the U.S.? That process seems to be proceeding but going slowly. There are some minerals we’re not going to be able to get from the United States at all and are going to have to get from our allies and partners across the world. The kind of open question there is what exactly is the bargain we’re going to strike with countries that have these critical minerals, and will it be fair to those countries? Because if we were to turn around to Chile, say, which has a huge amount of usable lithium reserves, and say, “Well, we’re going to take all your lithium, we’re going to help you mine your lithium, then because we have all these nice subsidies at home, we’re going to take it into the United States, refine it, turn it into high-end products, and then sell them back to you,” that is actually colonialism. [LAUGHS] I mean, I think a word that’s thrown around a lot, but saying, “We’re going to take your raw resources, add all the value to them, and then force you to buy them back,” that is not an equitable way of relating to other countries. And it isn’t to say that I think the I.R.A. on net is going to be bad for other countries. I just think we haven’t really figured out what deal and even what mechanisms we can use across the government to strike deals with other countries to mine the minerals in those countries while being fair and just and creating the kind of economic arrangement that those countries want. And those countries will be able to kind of turn around now and go to China and say, well, the U.S. is giving us this. What would you give us, China? And to some degree, the Chinese are much far ahead of Americans on even being able to use policy to adjust how countries make decisions. A great example, Indonesia has these amazing nickel reserves. Indonesia basically got Chinese companies to establish joint ventures in Indonesia so it could learn how to take nickel that was coming out of the ground in Indonesia and convert it into battery-grade nickel. That was not something Indonesia previously knew how to do. Now, it is learning that technology from Chinese companies and working jointly with them. The last part, to answer your question, is, well, let’s say we get the minerals. Let’s say we learn how to refine them. There is many parts of the battery and many parts of EVs and many, many subcomponents in these green systems that there’s not as strong incentive to produce in the U.S. So for instance, there’s been $50 billion of investment in the EV and battery supply chain in the US since the I.R.A. passed. We’re definitely going to be doing final assembly of batteries in the US. That’s pretty clear. We might be doing some refining. But there’s all these middle components in batteries like the cathode and the anode. And one possibility here is that we wind up importing a ton of cathodes and anodes from China, putting them into U.S.-made batteries, putting them into batteries with like 60 percent domestic content, and then selling them and repackaging them as U.S. lithium ion batteries. And we’ll be doing a lot of production in the US. We’ll feel like we have this great EV supply chain. But at certain core points of the supply chain — not very high value points, let’s be clear, but certain core points — we won’t actually have this dual supply chain from China. I think at the same time, there’s a ton of technology. One answer to that might be to say, OK, well, what the federal government should do is just make it illegal for any of these battery makers or any of these EV companies to work with Chinese companies, so then we’ll definitely establish this parallel supply chain. We’ll learn how to make cathodes and anodes. We’ll figure it out. The issue is that there’s technology on the frontier that only Chinese companies have, and U.S. automakers need to work with those companies in order to be able to compete with them eventually.

ezra klein

How much easier would it be to achieve the I.R.A.‘s goals if America’s relationship with China was more like its relationship with Germany?

robinson meyer

It would be significantly easier, and I think we’d view this entire challenge very differently, because China, as you said, not only is a leader in renewable energy. It actually made a lot of the important technological gains over the past 15 years to reducing the cost of solar and wind. It really did play a huge role on the supply side of reducing the cost of these technologies. If we could approach that, if China were like Germany, if China were like Japan, and we could say, “Oh, this is great. China’s just going to make all these things. Our friend, China, is just going to make all these technologies, and we’re going to import them. They’re going to be very cheap. China is the source of basically the world’s cheapest labor that can meet global production standards. This is awesome. We’re going to import it,” it would be much, much, much easier. I think there would still probably be some need to diversify the global supply chain because I think right now, just whatever you think our relationship with China should be, China makes a huge amount of solar. It makes basically more than 75 percent of the world’s solar panels. The further you go upstream in the solar supply chain, the more it dominates. So it refines 75 percent of the polysilicon that you need for solar, but the machines that do the refining, 99 percent of them are made in China. I think it would be reckless for the U.S. to kind of rely on a single country and for the world to rely on a single country to produce the technologies that we need for decarbonization and unwise, regardless of our relationship with that country. We want to geographically diversify the supply chain more, but it would be significantly easier if we did not have to also factor into this the possibility that the US is going to need to have an entirely separate supply chain to make use of for EVs, solar panels, wind turbines, batteries potentially in the near-term future.

ezra klein

I think that is a good place to end. It seems like it’s going to be hard to do all this.

robinson meyer

[SIGHS] Yes, I think it will be. Luckily, I should add, this is exactly the kind of challenge that we’re covering at heatmap.news, and folks should read our journalism there.

ezra klein

They should. And in addition to that, what are three other books they should read? Well, Heatmap isn’t a book, but you know what I mean.

robinson meyer

Oh, yeah, Heat Map’s not a book. The first book is called “The End of the World” by Peter Brannen. It’s a book that’s a history of mass extinctions, the Earth’s five mass extinctions, and, actually, why he doesn’t think we’re currently in a mass extinction or why, at least, things would need to go just as bad as they are right now for thousands and thousands of years for us to be in basically the sixth extinction. The book’s amazing for two reasons. The first is that it is the first that really got me to understand deep time. When you go to natural history museums, you see dioramas of what the Carboniferous used to look like. Peter’s book actually stitches it into a narrative that you can remember and that these are not just different eras that you see at the museum, and you have no idea how they fit together. And he explains how one kind of triggered the next one. It is also an amazing book for understanding the centrality of carbon to Earth’s geological history going as far back as, basically, we can track. The second book might be a little outdated now, but it’s called “Climate Shock” by Gernot Wagner and Marty Weitzman. It’s about the economics of climate change, and it’s by, I would say, probably my favorite economist. One of the co-authors is my favorite economist of climate change, Marty Weitzman, who I think, until recently, was kind of the also-ran important economist of climate change. Nordhaus was the famous economist. He was the one who got all attention. He’s the one who won the Nobel. Weitzman’s way of thinking about climate change is a little different from Nordhaus’s. He focuses on risk and that climate change is specifically bad because it will damage the environment, because it will make our lives worse, but it’s really specifically bad because we don’t know how bad it will be. And it imposes all these huge, high end-tail risks and that blocking those tail risks is actually the main thing we want to do with climate policy. That is I think, in some ways, what has become the U.S. approach to climate change and, to some degree, to the underlying economic thinking that drives even the I.R.A., where we want to just cut off these high-end mega warming scenarios. And this is a fantastic explanation of that particular way of thinking and of how to apply that way of thinking to climate change and also to geoengineering. The third book, a little controversial, is called “Shorting the Grid” by Meredith Angwin, who’s a engineer in Vermont. It’s going to be a little controversial because if you actually go look at her online presence, she can be quite harsh toward renewables. She’s not the world’s biggest renewable fan, but she is also not the world’s biggest fan of natural gas. And her argument basically is that, first of all, if you are curious at all about electricity markets and the actual policy that we have around electricity, which is an extremely cursed area of American law and policy and also absolutely essential to ultimately decarbonizing, the first half of the book is like the best explanation of how electricity markets actually work and the thinking behind them in such plain language. It is incredibly impressive to me, the plain language she uses to describe them. It’s like a form of writing that feels like it went extinct in the 1970s. But her argument is basically that electricity markets are not the right structure to organize our electricity system, and because we have chosen markets as a structured, organized electricity system in many states, we’re giving preferential treatment to natural gas and renewables, two fuels that I think climate activists may feel very different ways about, instead of coal, which she does think we should phase out, and, really, nuclear; that basically we’ve made it easy for generators, for power plants, that can accept side payments, that can accept money from other places, such as by taking renewable electricity credits, by taking various other payments that exist in the electricity markets. By making it easier for renewables and natural gas to kind of accept these side payments, we made them much more profitable and therefore encouraged people to build more of them and therefore underinvested in the forms of generation, such as nuclear, that actually make most of their money by selling electrons to the grid, where they go to people’s homes. It’s a really, really interesting book and, I think, a perspective that if you’re immersed in climate policy, you wouldn’t necessarily have. I don’t endorse everything that she says, but I think if you want to understand electricity markets and, also, if you want to understand this completely heterodox criticism of how we’ve structured electricity in the United States and what we might need to do to decarbonize, I recommend it.

But after Hurricane Ida, a Category 4 storm, barreled through Louisiana in 2021, his premium jumped to $6,109. Then his provider failed, leaving him facing a premium of nearly $13,000 a year from the state’s insurer of last resort.

“We were on the verge of being priced out of our home,” said Mr. Loht, 42, a research manager at a local community college.

Mr. Loht’s experience has become increasingly common as insurance companies react to cascading natural disasters by raising rates, reducing coverage and exiting some markets entirely. Last month, State Farm, the largest insurer in California, announced that it would stop issuing new home insurance policies in the state, signaling that more of the costly wrath of climate change is landing on homeowners. And Allstate, the state’s fourth largest insurer, quietly stopped selling new home, condominium and commercial insurance policies last year, confirming the change to The San Francisco Chronicle last week.

“We should absolutely be nervous that this could happen regardless if you live in California or if you live in Northern Colorado or a place like Nebraska or northern Mississippi,” said Pat Howard, a home insurance expert at Policygenius, an online insurance marketplace. “These disasters are wiping out large swaths of homes and insurance companies are responding in kind by getting out of there.”"

Many developing countries lack access to the cheap financing they need to make the switch to clean power, so they continue to burn fossil fuels, even though this is more expensive over the long term and hurts efforts to slow rising temperatures.

In a report last April, the World Bank framed the problem this way: Low- and middle-income countries “are caught in a poverty trap; they are unable to afford the high upfront costs of switching to clean energy, and thus are locked into higher costs and recurring payments for fossil fuels.”

Perhaps no place better encapsulates this energy paradox than my country, the Maldives, a nation of nearly 1,200 islands in the Indian Ocean and a little more than a half-million people scattered across 187 of those islands.

The continuity, as well as the differences, were on vivid display on Sunday when Charles, 74, took on one of the queen’s marquee tasks: a Christmas Day address to the nation. Standing in the quire of St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle, he remembered his mother and offered his people comfort after a year of loss and upheaval.

“While Christmas is, of course, a Christian celebration,” the king said, “the power of light overcoming darkness is celebrated across the boundaries of faith and belief.” He thanked “churches, synagogues, mosques, temples and gurdwaras” — where Sikhs worship — for their good works “at this time of great anxiety and hardship.”"

Climate change is doing strange things to time. Last year, ancient Roman ruins emerged from the Tiber as extreme drought parched the river, revealing history in the shallows. The last time there was this much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, there were trees at the South Pole. All of our fossil-fuel burning is accelerating or rewinding all kinds of natural phenomena, mixing geologic eras and warping the previously well-defined strata of Earth history. We are hurtling into the future at a breakneck pace, only to be outrun by the distortions of nature we have unleashed by rampant extraction and consumption.

All of this makes it harder (if not impossible) to believe in a Whiggish interpretation of history, in which life constantly improves. That’s not really how we encounter lived history, but it’s often how it’s told; history is usually written by the victors, and things typically get better for them, at least for a while.

It is in the gap between present and future, where outcomes are not yet determined, that Jenny Odell enters with her paradigm-destroying new book, “Saving Time: Discovering a Life Beyond the Clock.” This grand, eclectic, wide-ranging work is about the various problems that swirl out from dominant conceptions of “time,” which sometimes means history, sometimes means an individual lifetime and sometimes means the future.

Odell, an artist and writer, has said that “Saving Time” grew out of her 2019 best seller, “How to Do Nothing,” about resisting the dangers of the “attention economy.” “Saving Time” began, she tweeted, as an exploration of the phrase “time is money” and “the relationship of time to power.” But while investigating that relationship, she found that it intersected with the climate crisis, and that both contributed to her existential dread."

Visitors staying overnight would receive a different QR code noting their status and would not have to pay the fee, and neither would people who come into the city for work. Other exemptions include residents of Venice and the Veneto Region, children under 14, people studying in Venice, people who own property there and their immediate families and those who fall within a few other categories.

As part of the plan, municipal police and authorized inspectors would check people at random and anyone without the proper QR code would face a fine of between 50 euros and 300 euros, about $53 to $321. Residents will not need a QR code, just proof of residency. During the discussion on Tuesday, Mr. Brugnaro said the QR code was not a geo-tagging device, and that “no one will be tracked,” the news agency ANSA reported.

For one thing, Livermore’s monster laser isn’t 100 percent efficient. The next step — getting so much energy out of fusion that it exceeds the total energy drawn from the grid — is still a long ways off. Still, Livermore scientists were over the moon. When Tammy Ma, a plasma physicist, got word a few hours later, she was at San Francisco International Airport waiting for a flight. She told reporters on Tuesday that she burst into tears of joy.

As an interesting aside, the Livermore experiment produced a lot of power (how fast energy is used, as in weight lifting) but not much total energy (as is expended over the course of a marathon). For less than a billionth of a second, the power from fusion reactions was far greater than that of the entire U.S. power grid. But because the pulse was so brief, the total energy produced was only about enough to boil a few kettles of water.

At this point I want to stop with the superlatives and mention a prosaic number: 25 cents. Two fusion experts told me separately that for fusion to become commercially practical, the cost of the fuel targets will need to fall to around 25 cents each, since a commercial-scale plant will need to use them up at a rate of about 10 a second. We’re a long way from that. It’s not just the gold and diamond. It’s mainly the labor-intensive fabrication process, which today takes seven months. The spherical targets that Livermore uses must be almost perfectly smooth: A flaw the size of a single bacterium can degrade their implosion.

“If the target fabrication cost turns out to be a dollar or two,” rather than around 25 cents, “then that would greatly increase the size and capital cost of the power plant,” Stephen Bodner, a plasma physicist who is retired from the Naval Research Laboratory, wrote in an email. That’s based on the idea that bigger power plants would produce more electricity per shot, so a more expensive target would still be affordable.

Simon Woodruff, who has evaluated fusion plant designs for the federal government’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, wrote in an email that there are four key metrics. First is the gain — energy out versus energy in. A gain of 1.0 or more is considered ignition. The gain achieved by Livermore this month was 1.5, and the facility’s potential is about 20. To be economical, the gain needs to be 100 to 200, he wrote. Second is the efficiency with which grid power is turned into laser power.

I’m Ezra Klein. This is “The Ezra Klein Show.” I guess I’ll begin by saying that if I sound a little hoarse today, a little husky, I am. To every parent who ever told me how bad cold and flu season is, what an unending unrelenting disruption of life it is, I am so sorry. I did not understand what you were saying to me. I did not get it. And now, I do. It is wild that parents just go on like this. OK, the episode today, though. You can’t understand this era in American politics without recognizing that it’s playing out in the context of China. Sometimes it’s direct, as in the way much of American manufacturing moved offshore to China, altering the politics of a lot of the Midwest. Sometimes it’s indirect, as in the way the sense that China still builds things and we don’t, has become a driving political argument, and has largely inspired, I think, the new focus on production and industrial policy in Washington. Things like the CHIPS and Science Act are explicitly framed as keeping our technology lead or increasing our technology lead, vis-à-vis China. And a lot that is happening in terms of buy American and supply chain rules, they are about trying to rebuild a manufacturing capacity so that we are not dependent on China. I say all that because there is a sense that to cover China is to cover something far away. It’s a foreign policy episode. I don’t think that’s true. I don’t that distinction actually holds. China’s size and centrality make it a kind of political hyper-object. It’s near and far and different and familiar and here and there, all at the same time. To cover China is to cover, in a way, America. And I am, of course, typing these words on a device made in China, really literalizing the point of this introduction. So this year on the show, we’re going to be spending more time covering China and the China-U.S. relationship. And I want to begin that with Yuen Yuen Ang, a China scholar at Johns Hopkins University, who’s done pioneering work on understanding China’s political system and its political development. And one of her basic arguments is that we are so focused on how China chooses its leaders on the symmetry, or lack thereof, between our political institutions and China’s, that we really miss its governing institutions. We really miss a much more consequential revolution in how China is actually administrated. And once you begin to see it that way, it also has pretty profound implications. Or at least, it is an interesting way of thinking about how we are governed here. As always, my email, ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. [MUSIC PLAYING] Yuen Yuen Ang, welcome to the show

yuen yuen ang

Thank you very much for having me. I’m super excited to be on your podcast.

ezra klein

So you wrote an Op-Ed for The New York Times, which is a great northeastern regional newspaper, after the Chinese Communist Party’s Congress in the fall. And you said that we are witnessing the end of an era in China’s history. The end of what era, and the beginning of what era?

yuen yuen ang

It is the end of the reform era that was pioneered by Deng Xiaoping. Most people would put the starting point in December 1978, when he gave a historic speech, launching the era of reform and opening. And that lasted for 35 years. Xi Jinping took over in 2012. And that was a structural break in Chinese political economy on several dimensions. Economically, he brought back an emphasis on state ownership and control in the economy. Politically, he stepped up on political controls. And in terms of foreign policy, he began to project Chinese ambition to rise as a global superpower. So that process went on for a period of 10 years. By 2022, his consolidation of personal power was, I would say, complete by the October congress. And so that was why I wrote that, at that particular point, when he officially assumed office as his third term, as the paramount leader of the Chinese Communist Party, when he stacked his cabinet with all of his loyalists — that, I think, marked the end of the reform era and the beginning of a personalist dictatorship under Xi Jinping.

ezra klein

I want to spend some time in the Deng era. Because the way you have framed it, which I think is a little bit unusual, has been really quite revelatory for me. But before we go into that, I want to ask you about something you said to me at a conference, which is that we often talk about the U.S. and China as competitors, as antagonists. And that you view them in a way — you view us, in a way, as mirror images of each other. What do you mean by that?

yuen yuen ang

The expression that I use is “the clash of two gilded ages.” So when I read about American history during the Gilded Age — and that was roughly from 1870 to 1900. When I read the stories, I could just change the names from American names to Chinese names, and they would fit China perfectly. And the reason for that is not just a coincidence. It’s because if you think about America in the late 19th century and China in the reform era, these were both large nations that had just undergone a period of destruction. And so they had this opportunity of reinventing themselves after destruction and creating capitalism from scratch.

ezra klein

So that’s for America, the Civil War, and for China, the Maoist period?

yuen yuen ang

Yes. It was the Maoist period, and more specifically, the end of the 10-year Cultural Revolution, which was a de facto civil war within China. And so because of the similarities between these fundamental conditions of recreating after destruction, you see this dramatic mixed outcome of spectacular growth, industrialization and urbanization on the one hand, along with corruption, inequality, debt risks, on the other hand. And so to use an expression from Dickens, it was the best of times, and it was the worst of times. It is the best kind of drama that one can write, if you wanted to write an epic development drama. And so when I look at it from this lens, I think it helps us to avoid seeing China as an exotic, alien and even scary entity. But through the lens of what Americans already know from the past, it helps us to see China in a mixture of, these are the positive familiar to us, but then these are the parts that are different. Because at the end of the day, China has a completely different authoritarian political system.

ezra klein

I’ve been thinking, for a project I’m working on, a lot about our political rhetoric about China. And something I think is underplayed in it is that we don’t primarily, I think, treat them as a country to be afraid of. We do treat them as a profound competitor. But I think if you really listen to what politicians on the left and the right have said about China repeatedly over the past 10, 15, 20 years, and the effect it’s had on American policy, the dominant political emotion is envy. We envy China being, or maybe having been — we’ll talk about what has changed in a couple of minutes — in this period of developmentalism, this period of being willing to take risks, of acting aggressively. It has a lot of corruption, but — and we can talk about this — the corruption is maybe a byproduct of action. The thing that we say about China is we envy their manufacturing prowess, that they still make things, that they act. You’ll constantly hear American politicians talk about how slow and sclerotic we are. And what are they doing in China? They’re just doing things, they’re making things happen. They’re building roads, building homes, building trains. Does that feel right to you? And then how do you think about envy as a kind of frame for thinking about that relationship?

yuen yuen ang

My first reaction is, how the American public perceives China has evolved dramatically over time. And so sometimes in class, I would show students how mainstream newspapers talked about China in, say, the 1990s or even the 2000s. And people were rather surprised by the difference in tone. And from the Chinese point of view, the prevalent perception is the Americans are not only envious of China’s rise, envious of its state capacity, but that America is now on a project to contain China’s rise. So from the Chinese point of view, it’s more than envy.

ezra klein

I mean, I think that’s true. But I just want to hold that idea of envy out there as we go through this conversation. Because I think that China is having a pretty big effect on what we do, right? Things like the CHIPS and Science Act, things like the emphasis on manufacturing and supply chains and infrastructure. And I do think there’s a way in which we don’t just want to stop China from rising — which sometimes, I think, America does, and certainly, in areas, it does. We want to be able to do what they do here. We want to be able to act more swiftly, build more aggressively. I think it’s interesting. But I think then, to understand some of that, we’ve to go to what you’ve spoken about, about the way in which we misunderstood the way China would develop. There’s this idea that as they got richer, they would become a liberal democracy. And that didn’t happen. And you say what happened in the Deng era is that they became an autocracy with democratic characteristics. What do you mean by that?

yuen yuen ang

Yeah, I’d love to come back to the topic of envy. Because in my view, the American envy of China, whatever that means, I think it’s often misplaced, in the sense that America doesn’t really understand China and doesn’t know what it’s being envious about. And it often is the case that America sometimes forgets what its real strengths are. And so I think it’s a case of misunderstanding the other, as well as oneself, which gets back to your question about what really happened in China during the reform era. Now the conventional wisdom, most people know well. The expectation in the West is, all right, China is one-party autocracy. But we will embrace and engage with China, welcome it into the global capitalist economy. China will open up its markets. And as it prospers, at some point, it will become a liberal democracy, like the West. And after 35 years, China did not become a liberal democracy. And it actually became more authoritarian under Xi Jinping’s rule. And so the West freaked out and thought, oh no, we made a big mistake. So that’s the conventional wisdom. And what I argue and show is that the conventional wisdom really got things wrong in rather strange ways. And the first thing that conventional wisdom failed to understand is that actually, political reforms were a fundamental prerequisite of China’s economic reforms. It’s just that those political reforms did not take the forms of democratization that we are used to in the West, such as multiparty elections, free media, constitutional protections of individual freedoms. But what happened within the Chinese Communist Party under Deng Xiaoping is that he introduced partial democratic qualities. And these included partial checks on power at the highest level, such as term limits. It included accountability, with targets being assigned to officials where they have to fulfill their jobs, and not simply get promoted because they are toadies or politically correct. He also introduced a tremendous amount of competition into the political system. And very importantly, he also introduced the norms of pragmatism and honest feedback, so that officials within the party wouldn’t be afraid to tell the truth, and there would be a moderate but necessary amount of debate within the party. And so these are what I call democratic qualities or characteristics. They do not add up to make China a liberal democracy. But just by liberalizing the party and society partially, that went a long way to providing a political foundation of stability, pragmatism and good governance that allowed China to prosper for the next 35 years. So that’s something that is missed by many observers in the West. It also is missed by, I would say, Xi’s own interpretation of China’s rise. The story that he and his propagandists prefer to tell is the one aligned with China hawks, which is, China rose because we have a strong authoritarian government. He doesn’t want to celebrate the democratic characteristics and the limits on power, because his personal ambition is to recentralize power in his own hands.

ezra klein

So something I found incredibly helpful in your work is the idea that the democratization and the opening, to the extent it happened, happened at a layer of governance that we don’t pay much attention to in America. And I’m going to want to spend a bit of time here. But you have a quote that is really lodged in my mind here, where you write, “In the United States, politics are exciting and bureaucracy is boring. In China, the opposite is true.” First, what is it difference between politics and bureaucracy? And why is the energy of the two flipped in the two countries?

yuen yuen ang

Well, we can think about politics as fundamentally the system of how politicians and leaders are selected. So the obvious difference is in a democracy, you have elections. In an autocracy, you have no elections. But then below that, you have this big, grand activity called governance. And that’s what the bureaucracy does. It runs the country in multiple ways — the economy, society, social welfare. And we are so accustomed to thinking about democracy as elections versus no elections that we fail to look at differences in governance. And so the China case is one in which you have the same Chinese Communist Party in office since 1949. But if you look at the bureaucracy and the governance, it has dramatically transformed up and down over time. And you ask, why is it different. Well, I think because in the United States when you have elections, that’s where all the attention goes. And we just take governance for granted. We just take for granted that the government will do whatever it’s supposed to do once the laws are passed. In China, you take the existence of the Chinese Communist Party for granted. You know that it’s the only party and it’s not going away. So the part that is really open to big changes is the bureaucracy. That’s where the action and the change happens. And so if you look at China through the Western lens, you will fail to see where all of the real action and political reforms are taking place.

Bureaucracy is a dirty word. It’s an epithet, I think, in America. If I say you’re a bureaucrat, I’m not typically saying something good about you.

yuen yuen ang

Yeah.

ezra klein

Tell me a bit about the cultural position of the bureaucracy in China. How many people apply to be part of it, take the test? How many people become part of it? What does it mean to become part of it? What is it to be a bureaucrat in China?

yuen yuen ang

Good question. Historically, bureaucrats, or government officials, have always occupied the highest position in the social hierarchy. And this is true until modern day China, where many of the officials I’ve spoken with and interviewed, privately they would tell me, the problem with our country is that being an official is still so important and occupies such a supreme position in our society. So until this day, when you look at the annual civil service examinations in China, millions and millions of people line up. It is very attractive to be a civil servant, not only because of the job stability but because of the status it brings. There was a time when the Chinese economy was booming that, relative to being a bureaucrat, people would rather work in large companies or run their own businesses. But as soon as the economy started to slow down, most people once again preferred being a civil servant and a bureaucrat.

ezra klein

And so my understanding of at least some of your interpretation of China’s success is that they did not really democratize their political system. But whether “democratize” is exactly the right word, they opened up, they made more flexible, they made more experimental, they made more results oriented their public administration.

yuen yuen ang

Yeah.

ezra klein

That is the layer of the Chinese state that began to develop the hallmarks of — I don’t want to say freedom — but entrepreneurialism and information feedback loops and being in touch with what the people needed and then trying to get that done in order to advance your own career and, frankly, to advance your own salary — that that’s, to you, where the action was in China’s opening up and reform.

yuen yuen ang

Yes. We can think about two types of autocracies. The autocracies that we are familiar with are autocracies with bad governance — for example, North Korea, Maoist China. But there’s another kind of autocracy, which is autocracy with partial liberalization and effective governance. And that was reform China under Deng Xiaoping. But that model that he created had an expiration date. Because despite the successes it brought economically, the Gilded Age was also wired into China’s development DNA. The same economic success brought corruption, inequality, debt risks, environmental pollution — all of the defining problems facing China when Xi Jinping took over.

ezra klein

One of the things you write about as an accelerant of growth in China is that you argue that you functionally have a kind of profit-sharing happening between bureaucrats and businesses. You write that what would happen is, quote, “Public employees took a cut of revenue produced by their organizations. And these changes fueled a results-oriented culture in the bureaucracy. All the results in the Chinese context are measured purely in economic terms.” Tell me a bit about that. I mean, a very big difference between working in the public sector and the private sector in high-up jobs in America is in the private sector, you get a cut of revenues, oftentimes. And in the public sector, you’re on a very, very structured fee schedule. But you make the point that in China, you have low salaries and a fair amount of profit-sharing, which you could look at as corruption, or you could look at as incentive alignment. So how did that work, and why, to you, did it work?

yuen yuen ang

So think about profit-sharing as both a literal description as well as a metaphor of the Chinese political system in the reform era. It occurs at all levels of power. At the highest level, it’s not about salaries. But it is about the very top elites essentially privately splitting up the spoils of capitalism. And we get to have a glimpse of their deals when we see corruption scandals. So within them, we get to know, ah, so-and-so, he was in Politburo and goodness, he amassed billions of dollars through his family networks when he was in power. And so, profit-sharing is meant to be a metaphor to capture this whole system in which Deng Xiaoping, in order to get the whole Communist Party to embrace capitalism rather than resisting it, he gave all of them a stake in capitalist success. So everyone gets to share. Whether you are the very top elite in the Politburo, right down to being a rank-and-file bureaucrat in a particular Chinese city, you get to share, in terms of the revenue being made by your agency. So he creates — in institutional economics, we use this term called high-powered incentives. So a commission is an example of a high-powered incentives, where if you bring in sales, we’ll give you 20 percent commission. So my incentives are very high to perform, because I get a cut of that performance. So he created this profit-sharing system where all of the officials are personally and enthusiastically invested in economic success. Now, as I’m saying this, you probably might think, well, that’s also really problematic, right? And that’s exactly right. It is problematic. Because in a quote unquote “normal” public administration, we want to have our politicians and bureaucrats care primarily about serving the duties in a routine way, and not because they are personally invested in taking a cut from economic performance. And so historically, if you look at human evolution, in the past, in pre-modern societies, whether it’s in the West or in China, actually most officials and bureaucrats function on like a tax farming commission salesmen basis. They were not actually paid a salary by the state. They took a cut of taxes they collected. And then because of the distortions that came with that system, over time, in the process of modernization, we began to have the modern public administrations we see today who get regular pay, paid by the government, who are not super excited about making money. But the advantage is, they are not corrupt. They are routine and predictable and accountable. So that’s the exchange we made over the course of modernization. And so what happened in China is that in order to create these powerful incentives for capitalist growth, they injected this profit-sharing system, which has both advantages but also severe disadvantages. So we can see all of the consequences play out today in the combination of crazy growth and, at the same time, crazy corruption.

ezra klein

I want to key in on that word, corruption. Because a lot of your work is about complicating the stories we tell and the broadness with which we define things as “corrupt.” You make an argument that there have been kinds of corruption in China that, far from holding back economic growth, which is the standard economic story, have actually been an accelerant of it. And that was actually true in America in its period of really torrid development, too. So tell me a bit about the way you decompose corruption into different subcategories, some of which are kind of steroids and some of which are depressants.

yuen yuen ang

Yeah. So I used the analogy of drugs. Because intuitively, we know that all drugs are harmful. But they harm in different ways. And the growth-damaging forms of corruption are like petty bribery, embezzlement, extortion of businesses. And those we can think of as toxic drugs or, at best, as painkillers. But there is a special category of corruption that has always gone hand in hand with capitalism, and I call that access money. So businesses are paying for access, for privileges. And that, I compare them with steroids. So steroids are kind of drug that helps you grow muscles fast. But if you keep consuming steroids, it has very serious side effects that build up over time. And those side effects only explode in the event of a crisis. And so we see that throughout the life cycles of major capitalist economies, whether it was the East Asian financial crisis in 1997, the 2008 U.S. financial crisis or China’s ongoing debt crisis today. If we want to go back to American history, in the 19th century alone, America had multiple financial panics linked to corruption, speculation and distortions in the economy. So my argument is that access money corruption and capitalism has actually gone hand-in-hand. But this is a reality that many people do not wish to confront. Because we like to hear the happy story. We like to hear that liberal capitalism is all about progress. It’s all about making people richer and richer, governments, better and better, and eradicating corruption. And it’s a bit hard for some people to confront the historical reality that capitalism and access money corruption has actually gone hand in hand, that development is not linear. It is interrupted by financial crises that erupt, due to the corruption and distortions from time to time.

ezra klein

Let me try taking that in a slightly different direction. Because this is a place where reading you, I begin to think a lot about your comment about America and China being mirror images of each other. So in America, as we’ve kind of discussed, we locate a lot of our ideas about political responsiveness and openness and experimentation in the parts of the government that are elected. And we think a lot about election rules and anti-corruption rules and so on. But we dismiss — we malign in fact, the bureaucracy. And you have this point that this is where China is the reverse. And so I want to try to put these two things in conversation. I think it relates to these ideas about corruption. Because worrying about corruption is why we’ve created some of the dynamics I’m going to talk about here. But I don’t know if you’re familiar with a work by Nicholas Bagley, who’s a law professor. And among many other great work he’s done, he’s been writing about what he calls procedural fetishism. And he writes about the American administrative state and bureaucracy, quote, “Inflexible procedural rules are a hallmark of the American state. The ubiquity of court challenges, the artificial rigors of notice and comment rule-making, zealous environmental review, pre-enforcement review of agency rules, picayune legal rules, governing hiring and procurement, nationwide court injunctions — the list goes on and on. Collectively, these procedures frustrate the very government action that progressives demand to address the urgent problems that now confront us.” And I guess a question that that raises for me is one of Bagley’s points is that the administrative state is so rule bound in America, it’s become highly nonresponsive and highly nonexperimental. Do you think it is more or less experimental and responsive in China than in America?

yuen yuen ang

Mm. I think this is a good point to dig into the mirror image. So here’s where I see an interesting difference that arises both from different political philosophies, as well as different political systems in China and the United States. And I also wanted to stress that when I compare the two, I’m not saying that they are the same. I’m not making a moral equivalence. The word that I use is that they are similar, but not identical. They’re similar in the sense that both are large societies, struggling with capitalism — like, how do you have capitalism, but manage its problems? But the way the two governments have tried to respond to the problems of capitalism have been drastically different because of their political systems. And from your comments, one of the key differences that immediately came to my mind is that the American system, because it is a democracy, it is first and foremost focused on placing limits on power. So whether it’s checks and balances in the three branches of government or controlling the bureaucracy with a mass of procedural rules, as you described, the focus of American and democratic politics is, we’re going to limit the government, but we are going to give society as much freedom as possible. And so oftentimes, what my Chinese colleagues would say is, America is a society where the government is small but society is large. Now, conversely, China is a mirror image. In China, the focus of limits and restrictions is not placed on the government, but on society. And so the party is obsessed with, how do we make sure that the media is limited, that civil society is put under caps. So it is a society where the government is large and empowered and society is relatively small, compared to government. And so when you compare the United States and China and you ask yourself, well, where is the source, the primary engines of policy innovations and adaptability? In America, you see that from society — from civil society, universities, the private sector. Whereas, when you look at China, very often the source of policy adaptability comes from the bureaucracy. It comes from the government itself. That’s not to say that Chinese private sector does not have innovations. It also has many, many innovations. But it’s always taking the lead of the government. And so in that sense, the two societies are flipped images of each other.

ezra klein

And something that makes very important then, is what the goal is, in China, of the state. And going back, sort of for this period of China’s really profound rise, what you write is that quote, “The goal of economic growth was always paired with an indispensable requisite, maintaining political stability. Failing this requirement, for instance, allowing a mass protest to break out, could cause leaders to flunk their entire test in a given year.” And we should say what that test is, because I think it’s important to understanding how China has tried to keep this bureaucracy working in a single direction. But that question of goals, of whether or not the government is right about what society’s goal is and right about what political stability demands seems very, very important to me. And then how those goals are set becomes very, very important.

yuen yuen ang

That’s right. Because it is a single-party autocracy, there is no question and no secret that the number one goal of the party is to keep itself in power. But at the same time, it also has a second set of goals, which is that it wants the country to be peaceful, prosperous and strong. And sometimes, the goal of the party and the goal of the nation is in tension with each other. And this is what we often see under the rule of Xi Jinping. Do you want political control, or do you want to serve national interests? So sometimes, these two are in tension with each other. And from the point of view of the Communist Party, capitalism is the means to an end. It’s not an end. So capitalism is allowed to thrive, to the extent that it allows China to become prosperous. But as soon as those forces have grown to an extent that it threatens the Party’s hold on power, it then needs to crack down on that. Whereas, in the United States, I would say, I think most people might agree with me, that capitalism is an end. Capitalism is an end in itself, along with liberal democracy. Although the two things — capitalism and liberal democracy — have also coexisted in tension in U.S. history. But that, I see as a fundamental difference, in terms of goals between China and the United States. [MUSIC PLAYING]

We’ve been talking a lot about the story of how corruption helped generate some of China’s growth. And one thing you argue is that Xi’s eventual rise to power is inextricably tied to that story. So can you talk a bit about the particular moment in which he comes to the premiership?

yuen yuen ang

Sure. I’ve always believed that the particular circumstances in which Xi Jinping came to power as the paramount leader of the Party has had a formative impact on his worldview. Because he came to power in 2012, in the midst of the greatest scandal facing the Communist Party in a whole generation. One of his rivals at the time, Bo Xilai, he was a member of the Politburo. He was a princeling, like Xi Jinping. And he was the party chief of Chongqing. And he was extremely flamboyant and popular in China, prior to 2012. He’s known to kind of defy Beijing and go out of his way to whip up national attention for himself. And so leading up to 2012, all of a sudden, the scandal about Bo Xilai broke out in the press. His henchmen escaped to the consulate in the U.S. in Chengdu, exposing what was potential role in a murder, and so forth. And so in short, just like the house of cards fell apart. And —

ezra klein

Well, can you go a little longer there for a minute? What was the scandal? I mean, it was known that many people were taking cuts. It was known that people who were in the party were driving nicer cars and had privileges other people didn’t. So what about Bo Xilai breaks out?

yuen yuen ang

Well, the parts of the scandal that were reviewed was of course, first of all, his elite level corruption, his collusion with private businesses who basically funded his lavish lifestyles in exchange for privileges — although the party only reviewed a small part of that. But the more scandalous part was that there was a British businessman who acted as a fixer for the Bo family. And he was mysteriously murdered. And so the scandal was that Bo and his wife were involved in the murder of this British businessman. And so because of that particular incident, the level of corruption, abuses of power, Machiavellian intrigue, just got elevated several notches up. And then more than that, after the scandal was revealed, Bo was falling, was definitely falling. And so there was a time when it appeared that he wanted to resist that. And all of those were rumors in China because it’s not transparent. But it seemed that there was a standoff between them. And we don’t know what the details are. But it just gives the public a glimpse into a violent elite politics, massive corruption, as well as things like abuses of power and even murder. And so that was why it got so much attention and was considered so scandalous.

ezra klein

And what was the reputation of Xi Jinping at exactly this moment? If I had read a hypothetical Wall Street Journal or Financial Times profile of Xi Jinping in 2011 or 2010, what would have been said about him?

yuen yuen ang

[LAUGHS] I think that most people would say that he was relatively unknown before 2012. And that, I think, was precisely why he was selected. Because he was seen as a safe choice, that he was a low-profile politician, unlike Bo Xilai, who was too flamboyant and made too much trouble. And if anything, most people know his wife better, because his wife, Peng Liyuan, is a famous singer. So some people give Xi credit for his ability to lie low and to bide his time. And by appearing to be this extremely low-profile, mild-mannered politician, he got his chance in 2012. And then year after year, he surprised everyone who put him in power.

ezra klein

Tell me a bit about, at the beginning of Xi’s leadership, how he takes on, how he understands corruption. Like, what is his theory of corruption, both as a substantive problem for China and for the Chinese Communist Party, but also as a political problem, as quasi-popular mandate he has?

yuen yuen ang

Yeah. So one question that I’m frequently asked is, is Xi Jinping fighting corruption simply because he’s using that as an instrument to get rid of his enemies? Or is he genuinely trying to fight corruption in the system? And the answer is, both. It’s not either/or. On the one hand, he has correctly identified corruption as a systemic problem. He correctly identified that he could use anti-corruption to get party officials in line with his orders. Because the system was so systemically corrupt, there were likely so many individuals who were vulnerable to investigations and indictments. So he had something to use against all of them. And I think that really helped him to get the obedience and consolidation of power that he finally achieved to perfection in 2022. But on the other hand, he is genuinely concerned about systemic corruption across the entire bureaucracy — not just at the highest level but also at even street level. And so he did both at the same time. His approach to anti-corruption has been distinctly top-down. So he empowered the disciplinary apparatus and launched them on a massive investigation drive. And to him, the indicator of success is the number of officials who are investigated every year. The number is very large. He also thought that corruption is an ideological problem, that if he could reintroduce ideological purity into the Party that he might be able to rein in this problem. The things that he didn’t do in anti-corruption is that he didn’t address the root causes of corruption, which is that the party and government has so much power in the economy. And that power was creating a demand for bribes and graft.

ezra klein

So if I’m a Chinese bureaucrat, I have a significant amount of power in a city of eight million people. And I want to live well, and I want to do my job, and I don’t want to be investigated for corruption. What are my incentives now? How do they change from before Xi to once his corruption drive — or his anti-corruption drive is in full force?

yuen yuen ang

Well, I think one way we can understand — and I’m simplifying, grossly simplifying. But one way we can understand it is that prior to Xi Jinping, the number one objective and incentive of government officials is economic growth. This is reflected in the targets that are assigned to them. And also, the more economic growth you can create, the more corruption and personal rents an official is able to collect. So if you govern a city that is extremely prosperous and has many businesses, then naturally, you profit more from it, too. I think the key difference that Xi has introduced — and this is not a sudden thing. I think it evolved gradually in that direction over a 10-year period, is that now to be successful within the political system, the number one thing to do is to demonstrate personal loyalty to Xi. And that may still involve some economic growth, but not always. And so a good example is “zero Covid“. So Xi Jinping made “zero Covid” his personal agenda, his personal pride. And so if you take the case of Shanghai, which is the most prosperous and vibrant city in China, what Li Qiang, who was then the leader of Shanghai did, was that he shut down Shanghai’s economy for two months. This was clearly anti-growth. But it was in line with Xi’s personal agenda of maintaining “zero Covid“. And at the National Congress, Xi showed the whole world that if you act like Li Qiang did, you’ll get promoted. And so I think that was the moment when the shift in priority was clearly manifested and solidified in Oct. 2022.

ezra klein

You wrote that under the collective leadership that defined China’s political system from Deng Xiaoping onward, the personal whims of the top leader would not have dominated national policy. Say a bit about that. Because I think from the outside, it’s often looked like China has a very strong leader. But your view, and I think a pretty widespread view, is that Xi has personalized the system in a way that it wasn’t before. So what was collective about it before Xi? What changed?

yuen yuen ang

Yeah. So I think it’s helpful to go back to our earlier discussion about the reform era. And he has kind of — a line that I like to use to help us remember that since 1949, there isn’t just one China, but there has been at least three different Chinas. So China under Mao, under Deng and under Xi are three completely different Chinas. Now, many people do not realize that. Because there’s a tendency to see China as a static monolith that doesn’t change. And because for the past 10 years, we’ve been hearing news about China under Xi, most people may not be aware that, in fact, he has drastically changed the economic and political system in China. So the political system under Deng Xiaoping had a series of systematic characteristics that align into a system that was simultaneously pro-growth but also vulnerable to corruption and risk. And that included profit-sharing, which we just talked about — all of the high powered incentives for officials to promote growth. It also included the democratic qualities that I talked about: partial checks on power, accountability, corruption. And it also included collective leadership at the highest level. So this wasn’t a system like under Mao, where you have only one strongman in power. Rather, it was a collective leadership of elites in the Politburo at the highest level. So everyone gets to have a say. Everyone also gets to have a share in the gains of capitalism. What Xi Jinping has tried to do is he took this system that he inherited from Deng Xiaoping, which had created tremendous wealth for China, but it also created tremendous problems of capitalism, like corruption, inequality, debt risk, pollution. And for him, the fundamental challenge is, OK, what am I going to do with this? Am I going to throw away Deng Xiaoping’s system? Am I going to create something new that is unique to the Xi Jinping era? And his choice so far — at least what we’ve seen in the past 10 years — is that he decided that he would reimpose a personalist dictatorship, which is with him in power. And he would reimpose ideological and political controls. So by doing that, he resolves some of the problems from the past system. The collective leadership was very easily mired in political fragmentation. But with him having all of the say, now he doesn’t have to go through anyone. He gets to slam the table and make a decision, like “zero Covid.” But it also means that bringing back this personalist dictatorship also reintroduces all of the problems associated with one man rule. So that is what’s been happening since 1949. This is an epic that is played out over three volumes; Mao, Deng and Xi.

ezra klein

There is this really remarkable moment at the last Party Congress where the man who had been number one before is forcibly — I think it’s fair to say forcibly — escorted out of the building during the Congress. The Times had a great breakdown of the video that I’ve watched many, many times now. But can you describe what happened there and what was happening behind it? What you understand that moment is having meant?

yuen yuen ang

So the person who was escorted out of the Congress is former President Hu Jintao. So he was the paramount leader of the Party who selected and brought Xi to power. So you can understand Hu as being Xi’s key beneficiary. In that context, it was shocking, not only for the rest of the world, but for people in China, to see a former leader be escorted out in such a disrespectful manner. That was shocking for the world to see. And I think that speaks to the evolution of Xi Jinping. It’s important to realize that he’s a person. He’s a human, like all of us. And that while he may have certain personality traits that have always been in place, I’m more inclined to see him as an evolving human. And I think that Xi Jinping in 2012 and Xi Jinping in 2022 are actually quite two different men. They have been evolving in the direction of him consolidating power to becoming personalist dictatorship. And so over the course of this evolution, you can see him initially being very respectful toward his benefactor, Hu Jintao. And by the end of this 10 year process, when he finally emerges at the top with no challenges whatsoever to his power, he finally also shoves his benefactor out of the door, literally. So that’s what happened.

ezra klein

But at the same time that he’s consolidating this power, it seems there’s also been, really for the first profound moment — I don’t want to say a challenge to his rule — but real, popular expression of discontent in these protests that you began to see towards the end of the year in China, and that if I’m understanding the news coverage of them correctly, seemed to have actually shifted Xi’s agenda, particularly around Covid. So can you talk a bit about what those protests were, and then how you understand their effect on his administration?

yuen yuen ang

The key significance of these protests that we saw in November is that it is the first time Chinese citizens have come out into the streets in demonstration against a national policy, and have successfully made China’s top leader change his mind. That is something unusual. There’s always been sporadic protests around China, but they’re always about local issues. They’re not directed at a national policy, and in particular, the personal agenda of the top leader. And so it’s really remarkable that people came out in mass demonstration. And they successfully got Xi to listen. And he changed course very suddenly. So suddenly that China, until now, is still unprepared for the massive surge of infections. But that’s the long term significance of this particular event. That is something we have not seen before. [MUSIC PLAYING]

ezra klein

So I went to China — I mean, it’s probably over a decade ago now. I was part of a journalistic junket there. And I had all these meetings with people of the Communist Party or officials or this or that. And the thing that was really striking to me then is how consistent the articulated belief that if growth fell beneath 6 percent or 7 percent, political stability would collapse. And so the most important thing for China was that growth did not fall beneath 6 percent or 7 percent. And what was striking to me about much of the last few years under Xi is that he seemed to abandon that view. So he did this huge and very arbitrary crackdown on the technology industry, which hopefully, you can describe a bit, in 2021. The “zero Covid” was very much a consolidation of power and authority and surveillance that was obviously going to hurt economic growth. And then it seems that that prediction began to come true a bit, that you actually did begin to see mass protests again. And he moved back to economic growth very quickly, all the way from “zero Covid” to really a let-‘er-rip policy of Covid, which is a dramatically, dramatically different approach if you believe that there was a substantive view behind it, that you did not want mass death from Covid in China. So how do you think about that, about that relationship Xi has now with, what has been for a very long time, the overriding goal of Chinese political movement, which is, keep growth high enough that there is happiness with the Communist Party and stability in the political system?

yuen yuen ang

The way I think about it is that when Xi took over, he began to change the basis of legitimacy of the Communist Party. So under the Deng Xiaoping era, the basis of legitimacy was performance. So that was the 6, 7 percent economic growth you’re talking about — and along with that, generally effective governance, not something like “zero Covid,” provision of social goods and welfare. And so was performance was the fundamental basis of legitimacy for the Party. Now when Xi took over power, he began to change that, for a number of reasons. The first reason is a good reason, which is he realized that the stage of development in China has reached the point where if you just continue to produce more 7 percent G.D.P., it’s not going to make people happy. It’s actually going to produce more problems. Because the fundamental problems are structural, things like extreme inequality. The more G.D.P. you produce, you just make the super rich people even richer. So he recognized that there was a need for legitimacy coming from things like equity, from fighting corruption. And so you see that he adjusted his domestic policies with a focus on fighting poverty, fighting corruption. At the same time, his objectives were mixed. And his desire to structurally reform the Chinese economy was also mixed up with his personal ambitions for consolidating power. And that process of consolidating power necessarily has to involve things like cracking down on the media, exercising more political control, having more surveillance. And all of these actions at the same time are anti-growth. So I would say that there are contradictions, fundamental tensions between his portfolio of multiple objectives, some of which are about himself, some of which are about keeping the Party in power and some of which are about genuinely trying to restructure the Chinese economy.

ezra klein

I want to bring back in this idea of there being interesting symmetries between America and China. And maybe I’ll do it by reading another quote that I’ve thought about from Nicholas Bagley. And he’s talking here about the American procedural state. He writes, “Legitimacy is not solely, not even primarily, a product of the procedures that agencies follow. Legitimacy arises more generally from the perception that government is capable, informed, prompt, responsive and fair.” And there’s one set of critiques you could offer there on America and the way that maybe we have lost sight of what government is trying to do instead of focusing so much on how it does it. But there’s another, I think, on China, which is that one way to read the long period of reform you’re talking about is that for whatever reason, however it was done, there was a relatively broad sense that government was capable, informed, prompt, responsive and relatively fair. And that under Xi, a danger — part of these, you get this kind of personalistic rule where it’s flipping back and forth and it’s about the whims of one man — you begin to lose that. As I understand it, Xi is relatively popular from what we know. It’s not even exactly that the danger in China is that people would be upset that he’s running the system, but that if he runs the system in a way that begins to break that sense that the Chinese people have had that their government is almost omniscient and keeps making these good decisions and continuing growth and moving the country forward — that that’s the real point of legitimacy crisis.

yuen yuen ang

Yeah. The way I would think about legitimacy in layman’s terms would be, explain to me why you deserve your power. Is it because you perform? Is it because you are super honest but you don’t perform that well? Or is it something else? Like, give me a reason why you deserve your power. I think that’s what legitimacy is about. And in terms of Xi’s personal legitimacy, I think the verdict has changed over time, rapidly. Prior to 2022, around the time that Covid broke out, I would say that actually at the time, he might actually have been really popular in China. Because his anti-poverty and anti-corruption policies, you could describe them as populist. They appeal to the poor and the lower classes in China. They appeal to the public resentment against corruption. He scored a number of achievements. Like on the environmental front, he has been very determined in cleaning up pollution and reducing carbon emissions. And “zero Covid” was, at the initial stage of outbreak, a success. The situation changed very quickly by the end of 2022 because the nature of the virus changed. It became highly transmissible but not as severe as the original Covid. And so the nature of this virus became completely incompatible with the draconian “zero Covid” policies. And by insisting on that policy, he was racking tremendous damage throughout the economy. People were losing jobs. Businesses were shutting down. Logistics was destroyed. And so that was how, I think, public opinion of him changed so rapidly and drastically within months in 2022.

Tell me about the tech crackdown in 2021.

yuen yuen ang

The tech crackdown is popularly known by the slogan, common prosperity. And this slogan is in line with Xi’s overall populist image, him wanting to portray himself as the man of the masses. It also reflects his fundamental challenge, as I’ve said, of restructuring the Chinese economy so that you don’t just get more G.D.P. but you get higher quality and more equitable growth. So the overall objectives make sense. You can think of them from the American lens as progressive goals, in the sense that Progressive Era policies were designed to correct the excesses of the Gilded Age. So you can think about common prosperity as Xi’s style of a progressive reform. But what happened with the policy implementation of common prosperity is that in addition to the goal of wanting to restructure the economy to add more equity, it was also mixed up with the party’s desire to exert political control on tech companies that were growing too big and powerful from the party’s point of view. So the bundle of regulatory restrictions that were imposed on the Chinese tech companies alarmed both the tech companies, as well as the global investors who have invested in them. People were alarmed for several reasons. They were suddenly reminded of the enormous, absolute power of the government to change its policies at any time and the world’s largest I.P.O. at any time. They were concerned that China was undergoing an ideological shift, that it no longer supported the private sector and was wanting to reimpose political control. And because of these perceptions of unpredictability and political control, the market’s reaction had been dramatic. I believe one statistic was that within months, $1 trillion in market valuation was wiped off by the common prosperity campaign. But the distinction I always make is the distinction between the policy objectives and the policy implementation. The objectives of Progressive Era style reforms — I’m not wrong. Like when you have big monopolies, when you have delivery workers in the e-commerce sector, it’s entirely legitimate for a government to regulate these activities and protect the rights of delivery workers, for example. What went wrong is with the top-down, authoritarian way in which these policies were implemented, that scared off investors.

And what is the walk back been like? And what has changed? Is something that changed here ideological? Do you think that Xi and the Party understand the capabilities or the processes differently? Or is it just temporary?

yuen yuen ang

So there was a very interesting speech given by Xi Jinping at the end of the common prosperity campaign in 2021, in which he expressed a self-reflection and course-correction to central bureaucrats. And in that speech, he walked back on the common prosperity campaign, telling central bureaucrats that, remember, our point is not to take China back to egalitarianism. We just wanted to regulate the markets. And there was one line that I found particularly interesting, which was him saying that on eradicating poverty, we have plenty of experience. But in managing capitalism, we have much to learn. That is to say, that he kind of realizes that if Deng Xiaoping’s task was simply to take China out of poverty and generate wealth, that was hard enough, but China did it. But his task is even harder and more complex, in the sense that if you are trying to cope with the excesses of capitalism, the Communist Party doesn’t have a playbook to turn to. Well, with things like, how do you have mass industrialization in China, they could turn to East Asia for lessons. There were many playbooks they could refer to. But with the current problems facing China, the Communist Party has never had capitalism on this scale. It doesn’t know how to deal with corruption on this scale, inequality on this scale. And so I think there was a moment of reflection in which Xi thought, OK, I thought we could have this campaign, and then we could correct these problems using commands. And it backfired, big time. So I’m going to step back and think about this. And all I can say is, we don’t have a solution. And in that speech, he told the local bureaucrats, why don’t you guys go and experiment and figure it out. And so what we now see in 2023 is an even more drastic course correction. As part of the whole grand package of trying to save the Chinese economy, the Chinese top regulator has come out in the public and said, our regulation of the tech companies is pretty much complete. This is the signal that they would like to drastically relax regulations, because they want to bring back business confidence.

ezra klein

I opened this by talking a bit about envy as I think an important way to understand the way China and its rise have influenced American politics and shaped us towards trying to match or exceed things that at least we believe they are doing well. And I want to end by asking about the opposite, which is over the past, I would say, decade, roughly, the American political consensus towards China has become much more negative. Donald Trump ran on a much more forthrightly anti-China platform. But it’s easy to forget that one of Barack Obama’s big initiatives was a pivot to Asia, the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, which ultimately becomes a big political fire point and gets destroyed. They understood that as trying to cement American sort of leadership and alternative structures, somewhat encircling China, economically — at least in the sort of rules of the economic system. Then comes Trump with much more anti-China rhetoric and tariffs and confrontation. And then comes Joe Biden, and he is tougher on China — not rhetorically, but in substance, than Donald Trump. He doesn’t roll back much of what Trump does. And he has added on more, including these very intense rules about semiconductor exports and knowledge sharing. How has the turn in America, which in America, is often justified by Xi’s nationalism and authoritarianism and what he’s done to the Uyghurs and so on how, has that turn in America changed China? How is it influencing Chinese politics? How does it change what Xi can and can’t do? What’s the other side of that dynamic effect?

yuen yuen ang

Oh, that opens up a Pandora’s box. Where should I begin? I think with respect to U.S.-China relations, one of the things I observe is that China and America are similar, in the sense that they are both extremely self-centered. So if you listen to the narrative in America, the dominant story is, it’s all China’s fault. China became aggressive. China became ambitious. And so our relationship fell apart. It’s all their fault. And if you go to China and listen to the dominant narrative, it’s exactly the same, just a mirror image, where the Chinese would say, oh, it’s all the American’s fault. They bullied us. They’re jealous. They’re trying to contain our rise, so our relationship fell apart because it’s all their fault. The real story is that it takes two for a relationship to fall apart. And I think this falling apart has a lot to do with timing, particular circumstances. On the Chinese side, it just so happens that Xi Jinping is the ruler at this time. And he chose to project ambition as a global power, which alarmed the United States. He also chose to take the country on a more authoritarian path, which alarmed the United States even more. And then on the American side, it so happens that America is now at a critical juncture of crisis, both in terms of democracy and capitalism. And if you look at the Biden administration, I think it is trying to create popular support for great government action, the kinds of decisive, grand action that you’ve been writing about on supply-side progressivism. And in order to create public support for that kind of grand government action, the story it tells is, look. Look at how China is strong, decisive. Look at its industrial policies and its subsidies. So we’d better catch up. We’d better match that. And so that is why I think this convergence of domestic conditions in both China and the U.S. led up to the narratives that have become very popular today. And this idea of a zero-sum competition, where if China has the Belt and Road, the U.S. is going to double that. If China’s industrial policies, we are going to double that. But if we truly have a better understanding of not only China, but also the United States, there really is no need for envy. Because the two countries have extremely different strengths and weaknesses. It’s not a competition of China being necessarily stronger or richer. China has its own set of tremendous problems, just as the United States has. And at the end of the day, to me, what the U.S.-China competition is really about, if there is one, is which of these two countries are going to make use of their political system to solve problems of capitalism. That is the real competition. But it’s not a zero-sum competition of, you are doing this, so I’m going to double you on that.

ezra klein

I think that’s a good place to end. Always our final question, what are three books that have influenced you that you’d recommend to the audience?

yuen yuen ang

So I’m often asked, if there is one book you should read on China, what would it be? And my answer is, read the English translations of essays by the Chinese anthropologist, Fei Xiatong. So his last name is spelled “F-E-I.” And there’s one book that’s very popular. It’s called “From The Soil: The Foundations of Chinese Society.” And this book might seem unrelated to modern China, which is highly industrialized. But it’s actually the best text to understand China. Because for thousands of years, China was an agrarian society. And many of the political systems, the social customs and norms evolved and emerged out of agrarian conditions. And because they have been in place for thousands and thousands of years, they endure until this day. And they coexist in tension with a modern China. So if you read this book, it actually gives you deep, enduring insights into the nature of Chinese society. The second book I would recommend is a biography of Fei Xiaotong. And it’s called “Fei Xiaotong and Sociology in Revolutionary China.” And the reason I recommend that is I like to read about a set of ideas and then to read the story behind the ideas. And so the story behind this man called Fei Xiaotong is that he is one of the very few elites in China who was western educated, and was trained at L.S.E. And during the 1940s, he spent time in the United States. What shaped his ability to read China the way he does is that he is described as a marginal man, a man who lives in both the East and the West, in both of which, he’s more or less a stranger. And so it’s precisely because of his marginal mixed identity that is able to explain China to the West and also to explain the West to China. So if you read the two books together, you get a lot more out of them. And then the third book I’ll recommend has nothing to do with China. As someone who studies the country, I always trying to make time to read something completely outside my realm, because it actually helps me to think about China in fresh light. So this book is called “The Fractalist: Memoirs of a Scientific Maverick,” by Benoit Mandelbrot. And this is the pioneer of the geometry of fractals, which is the geometry of complex shapes that we see in nature. And this is his own autobiography. It is really a fascinating story about a mathematical genius who is not accepted for many, many years by society because his genius was so wide that it could not fit in any given disciplinary box. And so it was only at a very old age that he finally was tenured at Yale. I believe he was given tenure at 75 years old. So it’s a fascinating story about creativity. And it’s always nice to be reminded of the spirit of creativity, and also the resistance to creativity that we experience in the human world. So these are the three books that I would recommend.

These three simple, open-ended questions are at the heart of “What’s Going On in This Graph?” — a weekly activity we’ve been running in collaboration with the American Statistical Association (A.S.A.) for the past six years. This feature invites students to analyze and interpret graphs previously published in The New York Times, first by noticing and wondering, then by creating a catchy headline to capture a graph’s main idea, and finally by considering what impact this data might have on them and their communities.

Classrooms around the country, and around the world, participate regularly — either by joining our public forum where students post comments and interact with our teacher moderators, or by having in-person discussions in their own schools. They analyze graphs about sports figures like LeBron James, environmental trends like rising temperatures, economic activity like price inflation, and political realities like the ages of world leaders.

If you’re new to the feature, here is how it works:

Most weeks during the school year, from September to May, we take a graph that has been published in The New York Times and ask students to share what they notice and wonder about it. This feature is completely free.

We post these graphs on Thursdays, and include them in our free weekly newsletter, so teachers can plan for the coming week.

Then, on Wednesdays from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Eastern time, we host a live-moderated discussion where students from around the world post their observations and analysis while moderators from A.S.A. facilitate the student conversation.

Your class can join the discussion any day of the week, not just Wednesdays, and students can even comment on graphs in our archive.

On Thursday afternoons, a week after we publish each graph, we add a “reveal” to the post which includes additional background about these graphs, shout-outs for great student headlines, and relevant statistical concepts.

You can find all the graphs we have ever published, organized by topic and graph type, in two collections: 69 graphs from 2017-2020 (published in 2020) and the 79 graphs from 2020-2023, listed below.

Improving indoor air quality may be especially important for members of vulnerable groups, including children, older adults, or those who have existing respiratory issues. Most people spend a large chunk of their lives indoors, where common irritants such as dust mites, pet dander, and mold spores can trigger allergies and asthma.

You might face compounded health effects from poor indoor air quality if you’re a smoker or live with one, or if you are exposed regularly to outdoor air pollution, says Dr. Enid Rose Neptune, a professor of pulmonology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and scientific advisor at the American Lung Association.

Take even a few of the steps we outline below, and you and your housemates can breathe more easily right away and enjoy long-term benefits, too.

Cut off the source

This is the most effective way to improve your home’s air quality, according to the EPA. Some sources of indoor air pollution, such as smoking indoors and using wood-burning stoves and fireplaces, are simpler to eliminate.

Others, such as building materials and household furnishings, may be difficult or impossible to remove.

Be sure to maintain perspective: “We can only control what we can control,” says Nsilo Berry, a researcher at the Healthy Building Network. Here are a few steps to control sources of indoor air pollution:

Flush your air

Ventilation and filtration may make sense at different times or can work in tandem. Bringing in outdoor air flushes out trapped pollutants from your home, while air filtration removes pollutants and particulates that are already inside.

Shop savvy

Researchers are learning more and more about the potential health impacts of the stuff people bring into their homes or use on their bodies. Cleaning products, personal-care products, candles, fragrances, and other routine purchases can be sources of indoor air pollution.

For many shoppers, it’s impractical to try to avoid worrisome chemicals—and for everyone, avoiding them entirely is impossible. But it may make sense for those in high-risk groups to take a more cautious approach. Reducing even some of the known sources of VOCs and SVOCs in the stuff you use daily could improve your indoor air overall and in the long run. Here are some quick ways to start:

Keep in mind that the health impacts of the air you breathe are cumulative and include not just the air in your home but also outdoors, at your place of work, and at school. Everyone can take steps to breathe better inside, but the reasons that people need to do so—including the effects of climate change and the ubiquity of certain chemicals in products—won’t improve without large-scale changes.

It turns out that these methods, employed all over South Asia, are rooted in solid science, even though I didn’t realize it then. As climate change sends temperatures soaring around the world, people who are not used to coping with heat could stand to adopt a few strategies from regions that have faced hot weather for generations."

Blanca Huertas, the senior curator of butterflies at the museum, helped name the genus, which is one of nine new ones described by the researchers in a paper in the most recent issue of the journal Systematic Entomology.

The practice of naming new species after celebrities, fictional characters and others has a long history, and “giving these butterflies an unusual name helps to draw attention to this underappreciated group,” Dr. Blanca said. “It shows that, even among a group of very similar-looking species, you can find beauty among the dullness.”"

First, smartphones and social media emerged and had a negative effect on the nation’s psyche, especially among the young. Then the election of Donald Trump darkened the national mood, on right and left.

Young liberals were hit especially hard. A 2021 study by Catherine Gimbrone, Lisa M. Bates, Seth J. Prins and Katherine M. Keyes looked at the emotional states of 12th-grade students between 2005 and 2018. Liberal girls experienced a surge in depressive symptoms. Liberal boys weren’t far behind. Conservative boys and girls also suffered from higher rates of depressive symptoms, but not nearly as much as liberals. Sadness was linked to ideology.

Lord knows the right has gone off on its own jarring psychological journey of late, but many on the left began to suffer from what you might call maladaptive sadness. This mind-set had three main features.

First, a catastrophizing mentality. For many, America’s problems came to seem endemic: The American dream is a sham, climate change is so unstoppable, systemic racism is eternal. Making catastrophic pronouncements became a way to display that you were woke to the brutalities of American life. The problem, Matthew Yglesias recently wrote on his Substack, is that catastrophizing doesn’t usually help you solve problems. People who provide therapy to depressive people try to break the cycle of catastrophic thinking so they can more calmly locate and deal with the problems they actually have control over.

Second, extreme sensitivity to harm. This was the sense many people had that they were constantly being assaulted by offensive and unsafe speech, the concerns that led to safe spaces, trigger warnings, cancellations, etc. But, as Jill Filipovic argued recently on her own Substack: “I am increasingly convinced that there are tremendously negative long-term consequences, especially to young people, coming from this reliance on the language of harm and accusations that things one finds offensive are ‘deeply problematic’ or even violent. Just about everything researchers understand about resilience and mental well-being suggests that people who feel like they are the chief architects of their own life” are “vastly better off than people whose default position is victimization, hurt and a sense that life simply happens to them.”"

Government data released Tuesday showed that boom continued in June, with spending on manufacturing facilities up nearly 80 percent over the previous year. The manufacturing sector as a whole has added nearly 800,000 jobs since Mr. Biden took office and now employs the most people since 2008.

“The public policy changes that have been put in place over the past two years are now starting to show up in the data,” said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM. He said the increased investment was “undoubtedly linked” to government policies, in particular the CHIPS Act, which aimed to promote domestic manufacturing, and the Inflation Reduction Act, which targeted low-emission energy technologies to combat climate change.

As Mr. Biden gears up for his re-election campaign, perhaps what is most encouraging to him is that consumer confidence is rising to levels not seen since the early months of his tenure in the White House, before inflation surged. Measures by the University of Michigan and the Conference Board suggest consumers have grown happier with the current state of the economy and more hopeful about the year ahead.

That change in attitude may reflect an underlying economic reality: The combination of cooling inflation, low unemployment and rising pay means that American workers are seeing their standard of living improve. Hourly wages outpaced price gains in the spring for the first time in two years, giving consumers more purchasing power.

National opinion polls still show a sour economic mood — but it appears to be improving slightly.

In a new New York Times/Siena College poll, 49 percent of respondents rated the economy as “poor,” compared with 20 percent who called it “excellent” or “good.” That’s an improvement from last summer, when 58 percent of Americans in another Times/Siena poll called the economy “poor” and just 10 percent rated it “excellent” or “good.”"

Eastern hellbenders once thrived across 15 states, from Mississippi and Missouri in the South and Midwest to New York and Pennsylvania in the Northeast. Their numbers have dwindled over the past 50 years, however, and researchers have struggled to explain why.

Habitat loss, disease, poaching and climate change all probably contribute to some extent. But according to Dr. Hopkins’s research, the driving factor might be baby-eating in response to deforestation.

The practice of eating one’s own offspring, known as filial cannibalism, is common among species that, like the eastern hellbender, have evolved a parenting system in which fathers provide the bulk of early care."

But guidance rolling out from the Biden administration — presaging formal rules — has raised alarm among energy companies that some of the credits might be difficult if not impossible to use, at least in the near term. The resulting frustration is emblematic of the current stage of climate action: an eye-straining haze of technical rule-making that reflects a tension between urgency and ensuring that the benefits of the energy transition are widely shared.

Wally Adeyemo, the deputy secretary of the Treasury, expressed confidence that in combination, the rules would strike that balance.

“We have a great deal of clarity about the strategic objectives, and we’re already seeing the impact of that in terms of the economy,” Mr. Adeyemo said. “It isn’t about any one rule. It’s about an ecosystem of rules that have been created under the I.R.A. that put us in a position to go from a country that had underinvested in the clean energy transition to being at the head of the pack.”"

I’m Ezra Klein. This is “The Ezra Klein Show.” It’s no secret that liberalism has its problems. Government struggles to build as much or as fast as it used to. Processes meant to be small-d democratic get captured by special interests or paralyzed by polarization. Democrats have a lot of policy ideas, and they even have policy wins, but they struggle with the fact they actually have to govern and so are accountable for a system that frustrates people. On the other side, MAGA conservatism, which has pretty fully taken over the Republican Party at this point — it doesn’t have much in the way of consistent policy ideas. It doesn’t take responsibility for the system. And that is one place — not the only place — but one place it gets its power. It’s able to voice the frustration people have with a government they don’t feel like they have a voice in. It too often seems to work only for elites or for somebody who isn’t them. But there are ideas out there for how liberals can break out of this stalemate. Some argue for a liberalism rebuilt around outcomes or on making government able to achieve what it promises. Others emphasize directly addressing historic injustices — bringing in groups who have been left out as a way of restoring legitimacy. But Danielle Allen’s idea’s a bit different. Allen is an important political theorist and classicist who’s tried to turn theory into action. She actually ran for governor of Massachusetts. She’s used her perch at Harvard to help build these huge and really unusually diverse and interdisciplinary working groups on Covid policy, on tech policy, on democracy. And now she runs a group, Partners in Democracy. And Allen’s vision, which she puts forward in her new book, “Justice by Means of Democracy”— and I know I’m saying democracy a lot. Allen’s vision is something called power-sharing liberalism. To her, one mistake liberalism has made has been that it is willing, again and again, to deprioritize political equality in favor of material redistribution. But she thinks renewal isn’t going to come from people just getting more from government. They’re going to have to be more full participants in government, and that’s going to require fundamentally overhauling the system. And maybe more than that, it’s going to require potentially constructing entirely new possibilities within it. To quote Allen, “Representation as designed cannot work under current conditions. We have no choice but to undertake a significant project of democracy renovation.” So what would that look like? As always, my email: ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. [MUSIC PLAYING] Danielle Allen, welcome to the show.

danielle allen

Thanks, Ezra. Great to be here.

ezra klein

So you had a fascinating essay not long ago, where you outlined three basic strains of thinking about what the Democratic Party — what the Left should become. You broke it down to movement progressivism to abundance progressivism and to your version, which is power-sharing liberalism. So I wanted to begin with the first two — the non-Danielle Allen ideologies. What are movement and abundance progressives? And what do you think they get right, and what do you think they miss?

danielle allen

So movement progressives have done really extraordinary things energizing young people, building inclusive coalitions, intersectional coalitions, and really calling out the problems in our contemporary economy. So there’s a lot of good there.

ezra klein

Who are they?

danielle allen

So, they’ll be familiar people — the Squad in Congress, for example. In various ways, I think Black Lives Matter feeds into movement progressives. But certainly A.O.C. is a sort of standard bearer and absolutely the Green New Deal perspective has had a lot of movement progressive energy associated with it.

ezra klein

So then you have abundance progressives, which I’ll note that I’m very associated with that set of ideas. But you’re responding to it here, I think, to a version proposed by Misha Chellam, who is somebody who is in California and is a political reformer. And you’re responding to an essay of his in your essay. So how do you understand abundance progressivism?

danielle allen

So abundance progressivism wants to get stuff done. So they have been frustrated with what they see as movement progressives tying things up in identity politics, seeking perfection as opposed to pragmatically achieving near-term solutions. In addition, they have a very different model of the economy. So as you’ve been writing about a model of the economy based on supply side progressivism activating production, activating supply, not letting things get tangled up in regulation and so forth, even when those regulations are for good justice purposes. So, in that regard, they are less statist in their orientation than movement progressives. They’re also very technocratic. They tend to have a real focus on expertise and policy solutions. They don’t — for that reason — tap into the same kind of grass roots coalition-building energy as movement progressives have done.

ezra klein

So let me offer two provocations on that, as somebody who’s been trying to shape some of this — which is, one, I often think of abundance, or what I like to call supply-side progressivism, as being in a way more statist as its antagonist or its set of questions being around the ways in which the left has sometimes knowingly, sometimes unknowingly, made it very hard for the state to act or to achieve the goals it sets out for itself. In many ways, one of the things that I find myself trying to unearth is what I think of as the anti-government progressivism that is often lurked in the heart of progressivism without being really admitted into the national narrative. And then the other thing that I thought was interesting about what you were saying is, I don’t often think of it as in tension particularly with movement progressives as you define them. That a lot of the concerns there are about old processes that have been captured — NIMBYs, old regulations in California. You have a lot of things built in the Progressive Era — the sort of early 20th century Progressive Era that people feel have drifted into playing a different purpose. And so there’s an impatience or a concern about a lot of process. But because so much of the process is old and the movement progressives are new, I don’t really think of those two things as being quite so connected.

danielle allen

I think the place that I’ve seen people like Misha, for instance, make the case for abundance progressivism, they have absolutely focused on getting things done — effectiveness of government. So, I wouldn’t say that it’s statist as such. Status is understood as big state picture and an expectation that you deploy policy from the top down with as much public sector dollars as possible. They tend to be — abundance progressive, as I see it, tend to be much more interested in private-public mutual facilitation, redesigning mechanisms of governance so that the private sector can operate more effectively and the public sector can operate more effectively. So, yes, I mean there’s an orientation towards process and procedure. And I think, again, just drawing on Misha’s criticisms of movement progressives, I think that’s a place where he sees insufficient — and he and others see — insufficient attention to that question of process — what it takes to get things unstuck, to undo capture, as you put it, that’s accrued over time.

ezra klein

I do think that point about process and legitimacy is important. I do think of an important idea here and one that I think you challenge really interestingly as being — Nicholas Bagley, who’s a law professor who I had on the show not long ago, makes this point that he thinks government legitimacy comes from its outcomes, comes from getting done the things that the people want done — not from having a legitimate or overly legitimate process. That he thinks liberals have erred by focusing too much on legitimizing through process and have not been concerned enough about the outcomes. So that does feel to me like one of the moves that abundance progressivism is trying to make — this outcome-oriented focus as opposed to process-oriented focus. Does that seem about right?

danielle allen

Yeah. No, I think that’s fair except the only additional bit is that it’s an orientation towards outcomes that includes redesigning process to get to outcomes. But it’s not process as such. It’s not a view that if you just have an inclusive process, that’s OK. Nor is it a view that proceduralism is the answer to everything. So it is absolutely outcomes oriented for sure.

ezra klein

And so before we get to power-sharing liberalism, I want to ask about one other faction that it feels like we should talk about here but doesn’t really get mentioned in the essay, which is the Biden administration — for lack of a better term for it — normie Democrats. Maybe Obamaism the right way to think about this because I think it’s really in lineage to him in that administration. How do you understand what the center of the Democratic Party is — what faction and ideology that represents?

danielle allen

Well, I think an interesting thing has been happening with the Biden administration. I think they actually really are trying new things in that regard. They’re not really just a continuation of Obama-era policies. They’ve really put energy and new thinking into a form of industrial policy, for instance. That’s a pretty dramatic change of direction. They’re working really hard to rethink some of the basic infrastructure for labor, for how you think about connecting people between labor, education, opportunity and the like. Of course, they’re driving really hard on the energy transition but thinking of that in really systematic ways. So I think in that regard, they share some of the aspects of abundance progressivism certainly seeking in a kind of abundance of renewable energy, for instance. They, I think, are not at a place yet where they have a real read on how to be effective across jurisdictional levels. So I see some new things coming into existence in what they’re doing but really constrained by — constricted by — the clunkiness and antiquarian facts of our existing institutional arrangements.

ezra klein

So tell me about what you call power-sharing liberalism?

danielle allen

So power-sharing liberalism is an effort to turn the dial on a long history of liberalisms that the Western world and this country in particular have seen. So take liberalism in the first instance as committed to the protection of rights. That’s what makes it liberalism. So protecting freedom of expression and freedom of association but also freedom to participate, to vote, to run for office, to be one of the people that is co-creating the public norms and constraints that shape all of our lives. So liberalism is that. It’s our protection of rights. And power-sharing liberalism recognizes that all of the versions of liberalism we’ve had — 18th century, 19th century, 20th century — have always had a fatal flaw in their heart, and that fatal flaw was to reserve power to the few. So in classical liberalism — late 18th, early 19th century — political power is reserved to people who hold property — more or less white men for the most part as property holders. Then even in the 20th century as we begin to move towards some kind of universal inclusion, we get the right to vote for women. Finally, in the middle of the 20th century, we get voting protection for African Americans. We nonetheless see a political system that is still reserving power — concentrating power in particular in elites of various forms — moneyed elites, technocratic elites and the like. So power-sharing liberalism is really the goal to build, in the 21st century, a version of a rights protecting constitutional democracy where power is genuinely shared throughout organizational structures throughout political institutions.

ezra klein

So there’s a question in this about what power flows from. And one of the moves I understand you to be making you — should tell me if this is an incorrect understanding — is that most, I think, familiar forms of liberalism have understood power fairly materially or at least have emphasized materialist forms of power, which is to say that they’re interested in redistribution. They’re interested in, do people have enough money, both for sufficiency. But ultimately they’re worried about power imbalances from money to the extent they think about power much at all and that you think that there has been, not a wrong emphasis but an overemphasis on the material dimension of politics such that you have a liberalism that is fine so long as there’s enough redistribution but isn’t attentive to the degree to which people actually participate in the democracy and would be comfortable with a world where there was a lot of sufficiency but actually not a deep form of democracy. And so that power has been misdefined. Does that track? Am I reading you correctly?

danielle allen

Yeah. No, you’ve read me very well. So material matters matter for sure. Folks need to be capacitated for political participation. So there needs to be a certain kind of material baseline. But it is absolutely the case that I take material questions, economic questions, as being for something else — that is, they are supports for the opportunity of people to live flourishing lives. And to live a flourishing life is to be empowered in your personal life, but also, again, in that co-participation, co-ownership of our public spaces and public life. Now this is not to say that everybody has to participate, but that possibility — that real possibility for meaningful participation in public autonomy as well as personal autonomy — is, I believe, necessary for human flourishing. And, yes, I think that our approach to focus on G.D.P. as the measure for all well-being. And then we take G.D.P., and we redistribute it as needed, when the economy itself is not spitting out egalitarian results, actually misses a core element of human well-being. Focusing that way has permitted us to degrade worker power, worker empowerment. And in that context, it means that in all kinds of ways, we have blocked ordinary citizens out of steering the choices of the polity. So I am reactivating, reanimating democratic purpose broadly and trying to embed that democratic purpose even in our political economy.

ezra klein

Tell me a bit about the lineage of thinkers you feel yourself to be drawing on here. What tradition are you unearthing?

danielle allen

So that’s a great question and a beautiful one. And another person you should have on is somebody named Melvin Rogers, who is at Brown and has a great book coming out. But it’s a beautiful book about the history of African American political thought in the 19th century. And what this book does is unearth a treasure trove of ideas and thinking that have been really obscured in our traditional narratives about the history of political philosophy. So, basically, the traditional narrative in the 1700s into the early 1800s, you have an approach to thinking about freedom and equality and the like that goes by the name of republicanism — small r — doesn’t invoke the political party. What it means is that it’s a conception where well-being flows from that public participation and not merely from what we do in our private lives. And then in the early 19th century that smaller republican view gets replaced by the classical liberal view where it really is about our private lives. We want to be left alone, pursue our own business, accumulate wealth, do what we want to do with our wealth, and that’s it. That’s where well-being comes from. The public participation side doesn’t really matter very much. And so the traditional story is that that kind of liberalism just washed away that small-r republicanism, and that’s what we’ve had ever since. But, in truth, African American thinkers throughout the 19th century fighting enslavement, then fighting the failure of Reconstruction, fighting Jim Crow, have always maintained commitment to the notion that power needed to be shared — that the fundamental flaw in the American political system was the fact that power was not shared. So in that regard, what I’ve done in my book is really take the traditional picture of liberalism, and flip it. And say, actually, look, you’ve gotten this picture of justice completely wrong because you haven’t taken power seriously. And if we start by taking power seriously, if we start by recognizing that sharing power equally is the necessary foundation for human flourishing in a Democratic society, well, then you actually get a different theory of justice.

ezra klein

So I think that book is called, “The Darkened Light of Faith: Race, Democracy and Freedom in African American Political Thought” and comes out in September and does look great.

danielle allen

It’s brilliant.

ezra klein

But I do want to hold on this question of power. Because even having read a bunch of your work on this, I feel like it is still a little bit opaque to me. So you think of more traditional democratic socialist liberalism or labor liberalism. And in the old, “you manage what you measure,” I understand what those measures are — the poverty rate, or to be more precise maybe the supplemental poverty rate that takes into account government transfers because I’m a nerd, the median wage numbers, the unemployment rate, health insurance rates. What are the measures of power for you?

danielle allen

The measures of power for me do flow from the political sphere. And in some sense, they’re not surprising. They are things like the right to vote. But they’re also things like the right to run. Is that actually activated? Who’s able to use it? Who, from what kind of backgrounds, is running for what kinds of offices? Who’s holding which offices? And then also what I sort of assert as the virtue or each right to see and shape your community. I’ve started a new organization called Partners in Democracy that is built around those three categories and indicators for them. And if you take Massachusetts as an example, what you’ll find is that the right to vote in the actual activation of it, is very maldistributed. It is highly skewed towards property holders in Massachusetts. People who rent are much less likely to vote. The disparity is really quite extraordinary. We have a huge housing crisis in Massachusetts as you know. I take there to be a direct connection between the fact that the electorate itself — the activated participating electorate — is skewed to property owners. And the fact that we are not addressing the problems that face those who rent in the state of Massachusetts. So those are the kinds of metrics that you can point to. And across any given domain, whether it’s political domain or organizational domain, it is a question literally of who is sitting in seats of power and then also how are decision making mechanisms actually structured. Are they allocating power in ways that tap into the voices of all those in the community or not?

ezra klein

So one way it seems to me you could try to decompose some of this is to think about — and I’m sure I will miss categories here — but there’s participation — how many people are voting. There’s representation — how representative are the people who sit in power. And for lack of a better term, maybe depth or democratic depth because participating through voting and participating through regularly going to community or local meetings and participating through deliberative democracy structures that we have not yet set up, those are very different. You can have a pretty thin level of participation just because you show up to vote in biannual elections. And that’s sort of different, I think, than really being part of steering the ship of state. So can you go through a little bit more depth on those? Because I don’t buy that if we got the voting percentage up just a bit or even quite a bit if we did universal mandatory voting, as they have in some countries, or compulsory voting that that would really solve your problem all that deeply.

danielle allen

Right. No, I wouldn’t put everything on that by any stretch of the imagination. So it really is across all sectors of civil society and political institutions. So take the media as an example — the question of who shapes the agenda for what stories get published, which perspectives or points of view make it into our shared narratives. That formation of the kind of horizons of our cultural imagination is another way in which power is distributed. I have a student named Justin Pottle who’s written a great dissertation and is working on a book on exactly this and the way in which we ought to actually be reorganizing some of the infrastructure for our media ecosystem with a view to achieving that full inclusion of voice and perspective. The agenda that populates our different decision making steering bodies flows from that media ecosystem. So all of that matters. When you look at any given process of policy development — take Covid as an example. You have people sitting in private institutions, corporations, universities making decisions, advising policymakers really without much input or engagement from those who are most powerfully impacted by the policies that they’re pursuing. And I do think when you look at basic research design in universities, you can have a different approach to how the research agenda is developed. And there are people who are starting to build out co-designed research agendas, really digging into the question of, well, what are the actual problems people in a specific place want to solve or need to solve? And then how can researchers work with those folks in a specific place on developing the necessary research agenda? You change that kind of thing. That is a reallocation of power, and a lot flows from that. So it’s not just voting by any stretch of the imagination. And at some level I think people can read this and feel it’s a sort of overwhelming concept because everything that you look at can achieve a more egalitarian distribution of power than currently exists. [MUSIC PLAYING]

ezra klein

So in your essay critique, you make of abundance progressives on the other side is for assuming quote, “There’s a trade-off between modes of decision making that are responsive and representative and getting stuff done.” And I think they might say these modes of decision making are not responsive and representative. But the problem is that again and again and again, when well-meaning progressives create a bunch of new processes to be responsive and representative, eventually they become captured by special interests, by the status quo, by people who own a house now or don’t want things to change. And they do in fact impede getting stuff done. And they do in fact, make government less able to get to the outcomes that it is promising people or that is wanted from people. So I’d like to hear you answer a bit of that criticism in terms of what power-sharing liberalism might create. What about the worry that adding on a lot of consultative process given that that requires knowledge and interest and time, and a lot of people just don’t want to be that involved in government, ends up being a boon to those who have a reason to use those processes. And it ends up as another thing that gets captured by the powerful.

danielle allen

Sure. So I’m going to break that into two questions. And I think you asked a question about capture and you also asked a question about consultative processes. And of course you linked them. But I think there are two distinct issues there. So on the subject of capture, for starters, there’s this great essay from the early 20th century by sociologist, Michel, about the iron law of oligarchy. And he makes the argument that every human organizational form everywhere in history over time has always tended over time to oligarchy, to capture. And I take that to be basically right in an important way with the result that the work of democracy is to continuously resist capture. There is no end of history. There is no state of rest for democracy. Democracy is the work of resisting capture by powerful interests and restoring power-sharing just over and over and over again. So we have to do work to introduce new governance mechanisms in the place of those that are not working. Now, this doesn’t always have to mean consultative process exactly. And I think one of the things that is exciting about the time we now live in is there’s lots of room for experimentation with alternative approaches to decision making. So there’s a great experiment that’s unfolded in the Colorado legislature recently, where the legislature used what’s called plural voting to prioritize areas of legislative concern. So this is a voting method where everybody gets, let’s say, 100 ballot points when you start out. And you can vote one ballot point. You can put one vote on a thing you care about. Or if you really care about it, you could put all 100 on that thing. So every vote that you’re going to place on something you have to pay more for. So your first vote costs you one ballot point. If you vote for something twice, it’ll cost you four. If you vote for it 10 times it’ll cost you 100 points. So it’s a squared function there. And what that does is mean that when people are indicating their preferences, if they feel something very intensely, then they have to sacrifice any kind of engagement on something else. And so it produces a much clearer mechanism for sorting out intensity for really requiring people to make choices, to make sacrifices, to prioritize and the like. And people who are using this mechanism are finding it very productive and then productive as well for the ensuing discussions about what should be done. So I think that that’s a really neat mechanism that comes out of thinking and game theory and economics. It’s also the case that new tech tools, even including A.I. tools and so forth, will afford lots of possibilities. We will have lots of ways of clarifying more efficiently what some kind of common ground points of view are. I’m sure you know about the experiments in Taiwan with the vTaiwan platform, which can take highly contentious issues and help people more quickly see it’s a really rapid process of social discovery to see where the potential points of agreement or solution are. So I think it’s not a matter of using consultative processes as we’ve known them for the last 40 years or something like that. I think this is a time for very serious innovation.

ezra klein

I always find myself very caught at this point. And I think it’s good here to do what you did and separate out some of the different domains you could work in — so consultation and voting mechanisms. But you mentioned plural voting — or people might also have heard of it as quadratic voting. And maybe I am being dim about this. But a critique you make in this case of the abundance progressives is that their fundamental failure is technocracy. Their fundamental failure is this belief that the experts can get together into a room and make the decisions and that those decisions will be legitimate and that that is the way you should govern. And I think that’s actually a quite true critique of at least many people in that space. But I think that there is definitely a form of technocracy that afflicts the conversations about democracy and governance, where people keep proposing what are, I think, just truthfully ever more complicated ways of voting. When you’re beginning to give people an allocation of ballot points that then as they allocate more of them, it goes up by the square. So they’re spending their ballot points more quickly. It’s not that you can’t imagine a way of simplifying that through a front-end calculator system, but it is a little weird. And I think places where we’ve seen people try things that are not even quadratic voting but simpler — so there have been experiments with things that go by names like “democracy bucks” where we actually give people a voucher. So the broad community has money to spend on supporting political candidates with the idea being that we’re going to democratize the money that candidates get so that everybody has something they can spend on the political ideas of their choice. And we see very low take up of that. I mean, it has been experimented with — if I’m not wrong — in Seattle. And it was very, very, very disappointing to the people backing that project how few people actually spent these free bucks they were giving them. And that was in a much less complicated structure than quadratic or plural voting. So I guess I’d push this critique back at you. Isn’t there a danger of technocracy here and particularly a danger of thinking that too many people are like Danielle Allen or, frankly, like Ezra Klein, which is they’d like to spend a lot of time thinking about ever more interesting ways to be involved in government? But in fact what we see again and again is people don’t want to spend that much time on it. What they want is for things to run pretty well and beyond that to not really be that bothered.

danielle allen

Again, I’m going to break your question into two parts there.

ezra klein

Break it into as many parts as you like.

danielle allen

[LAUGHS] And the first one about democracy renovators, as I call myself, as technocrats which there’s a lot to talk about there. And then the second one about what does participation mean in the lives of most people as opposed to those who most intensely are motivated by democratic commitments or something of the sort. So, yes, you are 100 percent right that the democracy renovation field, or democracy reform field, as it’s often called, is powerfully afflicted by the problem of technocracy. And that is something I’ve also been a critic of, for what it’s worth. So in the work that we’re doing in Massachusetts, one of the things we’re working really hard to do is to draw a connection between any given democracy issue and substantive outcomes — so right where you started, in other words. So, for example, in Massachusetts, we don’t have same-day voting. People have been fighting for same-day voting for 20 years. It’s held up because various parts of the leadership in the state legislature are not interested in it. But people have been fighting for 20 years. Who is at the short end of the stick of that? It’s really people who rent because they move, their addresses change, they have to have registered in prior to the last 10 days before an election. And if they haven’t gotten it done, they can’t vote. And that just doesn’t happen to people who own property and stay in one place. So in that regard, there are a lot of housing justice groups — advocacy groups — in Massachusetts. And one of the things I’m doing is making the case, if you care about housing, if you care about changing the dynamics around the rates at which rents are rising and the like, it’s really, really important to also connect that to the same-day voting issue. So I do think that the critique of the abundance progressives that any given effort needs to deliver for people materially in their lives is absolutely right. And so democracy isn’t just about the abstraction. The point of democracy is it’s supposed to support human well-being. So in the ancient Roman phrase, “salus populi suprema lex esto”— the health and well-being of the people is the supreme law — that Roman phrase is what lies behind the language of both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. When the Declaration talks about achieving safety and happiness for all of us, and when the Constitution talks about the welfare — the general welfare, it is exactly that same concept of “salus populi”— the health and well-being of the people. So democracy has to deliver for that for sure. And all those metrics that you started with are absolutely still pertinent. But the question is getting to them depends on another set of metrics, which is about how power is distributed. So that’s where you cannot get to an understanding of the connections between the material things that people need or need to see changed and the power distributions without letting people talk from their own lives — from their own experiences — about the barriers and hindrances they see to what they’re trying to pursue. So I believe that approach to thinking about the relationship between power and material outcomes gets you out of the technocratic way of thinking about democracy. So that thing — number one. And then thing number two on the subject of, well, lots of people don’t really want to have to spend their time participating — I think that’s largely true. However, you can feel safe doing that only if you think that the folks who hold power are in some sense loosely connected to you by some sort of tie of affinity or the like. So the less well you actually feel represented, the more you are, in fact, going to want to participate. So that really matters then that those people who are not so well represented or don’t feel safe, given who’s in leadership in a particular organization or political space, got to have access to that path to power. So that’s really what the story is here. And I will say too just from grass roots work that I’ve been doing, a lot of people feel shut out. A lot of people feel like they don’t have access to voice and choice. And that is not just instrumentally problematic for them, it is problematic at an existential level. It afflicts and undermines a sense of dignity. It afflicts and undermines a sense of freedom. So I guess I would just caution against underestimating the importance of the genuine experience of empowerment and freedom in people’s lives.

ezra klein

But it actually strikes me there’s a tension between the two sides of that answer you gave — that side of outcomes and that side of representation, feeling safe with the people who are in power. So if you think of power-sharing liberalism as the liberalism is doing something important there — that it is actually speaking to what we think of as liberal outcomes, liberal ideas of justice, a lot of people really, really, really don’t want that. And I’m not telling you obviously anything you don’t know here. But you are going to have people win elections. And one thing that has been striking to me in American politics over and over again is how unsafe, as we hit higher levels of polarization and enmity, people feel even with fairly banal moderate modest members of the other side. There are many Republicans — particularly MAGA Republicans — who find Joe Biden like genuinely horrifying like they really, really, really don’t like that guy. The reaction against Barack Obama, who is I think about as pluralistic and open a major politician as we’ve had in national office in my lifetime at least — in response to him arose Donald Trump, arose the entire Tea Party and MAGA movements. So I think I’m skeptical that you can find that kind of safety within a system where there really are winners and losers in a divided polity. I guess maybe you can reassure me on this. Because what I see is a lot of evidence that anybody will become demonic to the other side, even if they actually do make a good-faith effort at trying to absorb more opinions. And I just am not sure a process fix can open us up beyond that.

danielle allen

So in my book — “Justice by Means of Democracy” goes well beyond process. There’s a different vision for political economy. There’s a different vision for how we think about culture, work, and society, and the like. And so I think you’re describing our present conditions quite well. But I don’t think that our present conditions show us the limit of what’s possible for human beings seeking to build free self-government for free and equal citizens. So the short of it is that to have the power sharing that I’m talking about does require a set of stable norms and guardrails — the kind of things that Dan Ziblatt and Steve Levitsky talk about in “How Democracies Die.” So instead of getting rid of those norms and guardrails — mutual forbearance, toleration — you do not prosecute the war until the last person is dead. It’s rather, it’s not winner take all, it’s winner take nothing. Or at best what winners get to do is chair the committee, but they do not slash and burn. There’s a set of norms and guardrails that are necessary for a sustainable, durable constitutional democracy. And so if you want freedom, if you want freedom to last, then we need these norms and guardrails. So then we don’t have them right now. So to your point, that’s absolutely correct.

ezra klein

Well, give an example of what you’re talking about there. Forbearance, tolerance — those are values. But what guardrails don’t we have that we should that you think would make people feel safer?

danielle allen

It’s not that the guardrails themselves would immediately and directly make people feel safer. The guardrails are about how people make decisions together in legislative bodies. So, for example, Mitch McConnell famously said coming back into the majority at a certain point — “Winners make policy and losers go home.” That is the antithesis of a stable Democratic norm. The point of a democratic structure filled with committees is that the losers stay on the committee. So the winner gets to chair the committee, but the loser stays on the committee. And the point should be that there is, in fact, a process that does keep the losers in the mix in terms of some kind of synthetic outcome. We are a long way from that. I am not pretending that we are anywhere close to that at this point in time. But it is that kind of set of norms that can yield a solution space that’s not visible just from a simple readout of public opinion polls on a polarized society. And that is what the real work of democracy should be. It’s about solution space. It’s about creating more solution space. This is where the philosopher, Amartya Sen, I think, is really the person who’s best articulated this. And he’s got this powerful argument about the value of democracy as really a knowledge machine, knowledge engine. And he makes the case like it’s really notable that if you look around the history of the world, democracies are a form of regime type where they’re not afflicted by famines. They’re not afflicted by famines because the process of social discovery means that knowledge moves to decision makers in a fashion that permits course correction over time and does keep broadly some kind of concept of the public good operating. And again we have led a lot of the norms that sustain that erode. So I think your questions are fair ones from the point of view of how could we ever get to a place like the one you’re describing, Danielle, because we’re very far from that now. But I don’t think we can read out from contemporary realities like what the actual possibilities for a healthy concept of democracy are.

ezra klein

I think Mitch McConnell is a good figure to think about a bit here. Because I think one of the innovations he is most associated with — and he did not start this, but I think he’s taken it to or did at various points take it to an extreme — is utility of the filibuster to enhance division as opposed to deliberation. And so I think if you step back on the U.S. Senate, you might say, hey, this is great. This actually implements what Danielle Allen is saying. The losers don’t have to go home because, in fact, the Senate has a supermajority requirement such that the winners cannot pass very much without bipartisan support because very rarely does anybody have 60 votes in the Senate. And so you might think, OK, great. The more filibustering there is or the more powerful the filibuster is, the less polarized the Senate is going to be, the less polarized we’re going to be as a country. And we’ve seen the exact opposite. Because, in practice, it isn’t actually valuable or valued or rewarded for the minority party to engage in cooperation. And something I think McConnell understood very, very cleanly is that if he could use methods that were built for deliberation for slowing things down, for making sure both sides had a say, to simply stop the Democrats in this case from being able to move forward at all, that would make the Democrats look ineffective. It would split their coalition. It would excite his own base. And on the other side, the kinds of Republicans who over and over again at various moments did decide to try to move into a bipartisan space, many of them got primaried out. In the Tea Party primary waves, they got knocked out in primaries by people like Donald Trump and the voters who supported him. I think the theory — this has been a long war for me in American politics — the theory of the filibuster should work. It’s just that it doesn’t because it doesn’t seem to be the thing — voters could reward the politicians who acted as the filibuster says they should act and come together. But, in fact, we’ve seen — particularly on the right, though not only — that this actual rule that should create an ability for the minority to be always involved, actually creates a way for the minority not to be involved but to be obstructive, and at being obstructive, to have a quicker path back to the majority. And in doing that to further divide things. So what did then the filibuster get wrong? How does that fit with your thesis here?

danielle allen

Yes. I would not hold the filibuster up as an example of what I’m talking about. So I share your view about the filibuster but for a very specific reason that does in fact align with my theory. So many people, when you ask somebody to define democracy, will start off by saying, oh, it’s majority rule. And that’s not actually quite right. Democracy is about equal empowerment across a body of free and equal citizens, and that is achieved through a combination of tools. Majority rule is one of the most important tools, but you also need a variety of minority protecting devices. So you need a whole kind of toolkit, but you have to be balancing them over time. And the filibuster is an example of a mistaken use of a minority protecting mechanism. The mistake about it is to connect it to ordinary legislation. And here there are literally centuries of work on understanding what kind of vote should be used under what conditions if you want to have effective functional government that is doing reasonable processes of social discovery, pulling voices in from the different sides, and the like, and synthesizing, and so forth. And you use that 50 percent plus 1 threshold for most things, for most ordinary contingent legislation, where context change and legislation needs to change and so forth. So supermajority should be reserved for things that rise to a constitutional level. So from my point of view, the filibuster is actually a perfect example of the misapplication of a principle of minority protection. [MUSIC PLAYING]

ezra klein

So you were a co-chair of this big bipartisan commission, Reinventing American Democracy for the 21st Century. And that report is available freely on the internet. I really like it. I think people should download it and look at the recommendations. But I wanted to talk about the third section of that if I’m remembering the number incorrectly here, which is to ensure the responsiveness of government institutions. And I would say it’s more about deliberative democracy. It’s more about ways you could have things like citizens assemblies, and meetings, and other ways you could have a thicker kind of participation and advisory role for the public then you currently do. Now, I think it’s fair to say that the concern typically about deliberative democracy is it doesn’t scale very well — that you can have it in a New Hampshire town hall meeting. But when you’re talking about the number of issues we face nationally, when you’re talking about how big the country is, you just can’t really make that work. But we also live in this world of new digital tools, so maybe you can. So I’d like to hear you talk a bit about the recommendations of that section of the report. You mentioned the Taiwanese example, which has shown up in a lot of your work across different domains. How do you think about deliberative democracy? And how do you think particularly about digital deliberative democracy and what that might enable?

danielle allen

So my original training, my original background, is as a scholar of ancient Greece. So that is the ur-example of deliberative democracy — the 30,000 citizens, white male citizens of ancient Athens gathering in the assembly, some 6,000 of them usually showing up for an assembly in a city that was 200,000, 250,000 population, there, across from the Acropolis, with orators standing on this big stone stage and in fact somehow managing to project across space through to the 6,000 people who were there. So in that regard, deliberative democracy, I have a soft space in my heart for it for sure and always have. That said, I do think that representative institutions are a powerful invention. And so I see the value of the deliberative tools and techniques that we have as things that can help us improve our existing structures of representation. So by and large, our common purpose report also pursues that approach. That is to say, we seek the integration of these tools into existing structures of representation rather than their replacement. So, yes, the vTaiwan example — the use of a tool called Polis is a good one. It’s a tool that can surface the spread of opinion — help people see potential areas of consensus and common agreement more rapidly. Members of Congress would benefit from access to tools like this. They’re significantly improved beyond opinion polling in other words. One of the problems with opinion polling is precisely that it doesn’t actually provide any opportunity for reflection that is built on learning. One of the greatest values of democracy is precisely that together we can in fact be much smarter than we can be as individuals. So all the places in the report where we proposed integrating elements of deliberation — whether that’s participatory budgeting at the municipal level, whether that’s having members of Congress have access to deliberative assemblies and deliberative tools to improve their own learning about what the issues are in our society. Those are really about improving that process of social discovery where we learn together about the shape of the hardships that we’re facing. We see solutions that can emerge into visibility because of that collective work when we can’t actually get to them from any specific point of expertise or any single isolated position. So that’s really the picture. And so you’re asking a different kind of question really, I think, which is about that experience of participation. And I think you’re asking both what makes us think that people are going to want it and why do we think that it is valuable too beyond the payoffs that I’m describing. I think we see a lot of evidence that people want it where participatory budgeting is used around the world. People love it. People enjoy it. People are really glad of the opportunity to help steer the direction of their municipal budget or identify needs that are going otherwise unnoticed by their central administrative bodies. So the reason we see a lot of people feeling the drag of participation is because right now it’s really hard to participate. And it will always be hard in the sense of taking time and a tax on time. But that’s where I think we need an economy that supports that. We need a workplace where we’re not talking just about work-life balance, but we’re talking about work-life-civic balance so that people have the time to participate. And then we actually need non-opaque structures to participate in. We have a huge opacity problem, which is a real tax on people’s experience of the creative joy of participation.

ezra klein

One of the things I think is interesting is how actually little innovation there is around small-d democratic governance. It’s like whatever we had 50 years ago, we’re just remixing that back and forth. I would like to go more deeply into an example. Because honestly I think this can be a little airy. So could you talk in some detail about whichever one you think is the best example for grounding this theory a little bit? What makes this kind of depth of participation possible? What does it feel like? You mentioned being able to feel a little bit of that joy of being in the process. What have you seen? And how does it work when that occurs?

danielle allen

Well, this is not a fancy example, and it doesn’t draw on new technologies — although it did at the time. But if you go back to the ‘07 -‘08 Obama campaign, the first campaign, particularly in the primary, what the Obama campaign did was produce all these DIY kits. It was ‘07 -‘08, so it was still super early in the days of social media. And people were empowered to run their own community groups — basically their own community organizing spaces. People learned how to organize. They learned how to recruit other people into participation. They were empowered to use the time and space to name the issues that mattered most to them. And at the end of the day, I think the Affordable Care Act came out of that. Because across the country, people at a grass roots level were figuring out that the thing that was hardest and worst in their life was the health care system. And those conversations transformed people’s lives. The number of people who experienced that, who participated in that, who continue to be politically active today because of that, is really quite remarkable. So that body of people — what they experienced with tools put at their hands that were empowering and that then yielded a process of social discovery that yielded a major social transformation — that realization that it’s possible has, as I said, motivated people to continue participating. So, as you know, lots of folks were then very disappointed in the Obama administration that that basic aspect of the experience of participation didn’t flow through into the pattern of governance. But it is the case now that there are experiments all over the country of people trying to do quite similar things. And now the resources really are amazing. They’re much better. So I was yesterday again here in Massachusetts at a launch of a new tool called the Massachusetts Platform for Legislative Engagement. And what this is is a combination of a bill tracking tool, but also a tool that permits people to post testimony. And the purpose is to try to bring into the light the actual process of who’s testifying on what bills, which voices are legislators listening to and the like. We, as it happens in Massachusetts, we rank very low on transparency scales. There are no public records requirements for the legislature. It’s very hard to know who’s testified on what bill at all, and so forth. So there’s a community of people that have formed around the work of creating this as a pure volunteer effort. And now they’re working to connect all the different advocacy organizations in the state. And as they do that work, what they find over and over again is there’s a very profound hunger for things that link clean information to the ability to see what’s happening in decision making bodies and then contribute your voice to shaping that.

ezra klein

So about a year ago, maybe two years ago now, you were one of I think it’s six authors on a paper called, “How A.I. Fails Us.” And I think it’s an interesting paper from this perspective. Because one of the main points you make there is that the way A.I. is being built, designed, conceptualized, and potentially implemented is very centralizing. There’s a neat move in the paper where you and your co-author say, look, when they say they’re solving the problem of intelligence, if you really look at it what they’re trying to do is solve the problem of central planning. They are trying to solve the problem of how you can have a system that plans effectively without actually all that much input at all. So we are now in this era where A.I.‘s everywhere, and everybody’s talking about it. And we do seem to be at this inflection point for how it will develop and how it will be implemented. So can you talk a bit about what you were worried about in that paper and what you’ve seen since?

danielle allen

Sure. So the paper is really focused on some of the core concepts that have governed a lot of A.I. development and A.I. thinking — even some of the concepts that are a little bit more 30,000 foot or metaphorical. So, for example, singularity — so the idea that the goal is to achieve an intelligence that aligns with the sort of singularity of human intelligence. And our basic starting point is the recognition that human intelligence is plural. And human societies are pluralistic. And human flourishing is at its most robust when that pluralism and that plurality of forms of intelligence is supported. That as a species, we maximize our capacity not by resolving ourselves all into a singularity homogenizing force but rather by activating and supporting the full deployment of our plurality. So the paper is arguing for a different paradigm for technology development — the idea that we could design to support and activate the many kinds of human intelligence to support and activate healthy forms of human pluralism. And there are people who are experimenting in this regard. There’s a new institute, The Plurality Institute, and it is a convening space for technologists and academics who are trying things out. There are folks who are working to design technologies that help people bridge lines of division. So instead of rewarding people for ever more outrageous things that reinforce division, you can really structure different kinds of incentives into social media platforms, and the like — so that those kinds of experiments going on right now. And in terms of the current moment, it’s a really big moment as you know and as you’ve already written about in such important ways. So with the release of GPT-4, we really are at a phase shift in terms of what the kind of capacity for these tools is. And so things are moving very fast. There’s just a real imperative for all of us to do the work of figuring out what the combination of societal norms, legal guardrails, and the like, should be for the use of these technologies.

ezra klein

One of the things I was thinking about when I was reading that paper is it’s a very profound point that intelligence is collective. It is relational. It is situational. And then I felt like you could also make an argument that particularly large language models being trained on the corpus of internet text — that their vision of intelligence actually is very much collective, relational, pluralistic, in the sense that for good or for bad, whatever they know is this huge inhaling of everything that — not literally everybody but — huge numbers of people have written, have put out. And their averaging is a little bit too simplistic of a way to put it. But they’re drawing connections, correlations, and trying to predict what this collective would say next. So in some ways, aren’t these systems exactly what you’re calling for?

danielle allen

I mean, yes, I think the large language models do have a kind of pluralistic construction for sure. And not only that, but they can do things. They can embody forms of intelligence that are not accessible to us. So in that regard they are themselves already another yet different kind of intelligence. So we have in that regard again another meaning of the concept of plural intelligences. So the question, in some sense, is really, given that they have that capacity, can we help steer the direction of the development of technologies in ways that support this good feature of human existence? Or will the capacities to accelerate the creation of misinformation, to accelerate fraud, to destabilize institutions and things like that, will that be what leads with these technologies? So that’s where I can — we just are at a really critical moment for figuring out what the policy guardrails are. And that’s just like the invention of any other kind of game-changing technology — gunpowder, nuclear power or whatever. It can do bad, and it can do good. And so the question is, how long does it take us as a world at this point — as an entire globe — to achieve the kind of conventions, structure and regulation that ensure that this technology operates primarily in the direction of the good?

ezra klein

One of the things I thought was an interesting — bringing together a lot of these ideas. So one of your coauthors on the paper Divya Siddarth, she is now a co-leader of the Collective Intelligence Project, which you’re an advisor to. And I was speaking to her the other day, and that they’re standing up these alignment assemblies. They’re trying to basically build a deliberative democracy platform on which people are going to be able to come together using the tools that have been designed for participatory budgeting and climate deliberative democracy, and so on, to try to develop senses of what people want in A.I. governance, in A.I. systems. They, I think, have some openings into the major companies right now and are working with them a bit but have an ambition that this will eventually be used to feed into things that are more publicly created standards. And I thought that was interesting because one of the concerns about deliberative democracy is it doesn’t scale that well. But actually the way A.I. is being created is incredibly narrow by a couple of companies and a couple of places. It actually seems like a quite promising space where you can have citizen assemblies that do have a little bit more of a role in trying to create a somewhat more legitimate sense of what people who go through a process on this would want. I’m curious to hear your reflections as somebody supporting that project.

danielle allen

Yes. I think Divya and Saffron’s work building out the alignment assemblies is just one of the most important things that’s happening right now. So they are using digital tools to build citizen assemblies. They are seeking to build a structure that will provide meaningful public input to key steering decisions that the A.I. labs are making. The challenge, of course, is to figure out, well, what exactly does meaningful public impact mean in this kind of context — got to make sure that you’re capturing perspectives from many different parts of the world. So there’s a necessary element of scale in it. But, of course, there’s also a real imperative for speed. We’re all at this point, I guess, expecting ChatGPT-5 by the end of this calendar year. And so things are moving really fast. And we just don’t actually really know what the impacts of these capabilities are likely to be. So the pressure is how do you design for speed and reasonable scale to support legitimacy in the near term. But, yes, I mean, and they can do this. They can do this work and they can get meaningful public input in in a way that governments at this moment in time can’t do — can’t move fast enough to do. So that’s where it brings us back to the beginning of the conversation — yeah, when you were making the point about abundance progressives and their concern about the lack of nimbleness that our current governing institutions have. We’re feeling the pressure and strain of that now as we seek to grapple with the implications of the really remarkable new models based on the large language learning models.

ezra klein

One critique you could offer though, of that project, which I think is a very common critique made of deliberative democracy and, more broadly, just democracy, but it maybe bites with real force when you’re talking about something like A.I. systems, is that what is the value of having people without technical expertise weighing in and controlling things that are highly technical? If the assembly comes up and says, hey, we want this to be legible and we want to be able to know what the system is doing. And the people say — who are making them say, that’s not really possible. We don’t know how to do that in these models. To do that is to basically break the whole approach. Who’s right and who’s wrong there? I think there’s always a suspicion that to have deliberative democracy means you’ll be having people who don’t have enough expertise to have well-founded opinions gumming up the works or maybe coming up with ideas that are really bad. And that has been an impediment to it and, I think, probably would be here too. So how do you think about that or how do you answer that?

danielle allen

Well, I think that is somewhat of a misconception honestly of what deliberation can and should do. So, the first job of deliberation is to establish the steering direction with regard to basically values, like what do we actually care about here what matters to us and why. And that is something that you cannot use technocrats to do. That is exactly a human question over and over again. It is the first human question. It is the human question that roils politics, of course. But that’s the thing that you need deliberative assemblies to address. And so if assemblies say, we want to know what’s going on, and then technologists say, well, you can’t if we have systems of this kind, then there’s a thing to negotiate. Then that’s the work to do is like what’s the relationship then between that desire to know — that need to know — and the fact that technology can’t deliver it. Does that mean we try to call a halt to it? Does that mean that we develop a different kind of bridge, et cetera. So the fact that there’s a discrepancy between the values people may articulate and what technologists think they can deliver is the beginning of the work, not the end of it.

ezra klein

I think that is a good place to end this conversation though. So always our final question: What are three books you would recommend to the audience?

danielle allen

Well, there’s the Melvin Rogers book that I am still failing to remember the precise title of. So you’ll have to say the title of it again.

ezra klein

It is “The Dark and Light of Faith.”

danielle allen

“The Dark and Light of Faith.” Exactly. So Melvin Rogers — “The Dark and Light of Faith.” And I’m sure you probably know Max Tegmark’s “Life 3.0.” And third one — Hélène Landemore, “Open Democracy.”

ezra klein

Danielle Allen, thank you very much.

All of our other public-policy debates, ranging from marginal tax rates to education policy, are meaningless without a planet to live on and democratic institutions that provide the rules of the game. In other words, this is the wrong time for the Democrats to be losing one of this country’s most potent constituencies. And while Silicon Valley bears some responsibility for the fracture, blame can also be cast on the party and on the Biden administration, which at some points has gone out of its way to alienate the tech community.

Things were very different in the Obama era, during which time a love affair bloomed between the Democratic Party and the technology industry. President Barack Obama’s win in 2008 was partially credited to his campaign’s ability to harness the power of social media to mobilize and energize young voters. Tech executives like Sheryl Sandberg, then the chief operating officer at Facebook, were praised for both their business successes and their work on social issues. Several alumni of the Obama and Clinton administrations took lucrative positions in companies such as Uber, Airbnb and Amazon.

In 2017, David Broockman, Gregory Ferenstein and I conducted the first large-scale survey of the founders of technology companies. We found that they were heavily Democratic, with over 75 percent indicating that they supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. Yet technology founders were unusual in that they took liberal positions on wealth redistribution but conservative positions on regulating the economy, particularly the labor market. Their basic worldview is to let the free market operate and then redistribute after the fact through taxes and transfers.

What changed? While our survey found that technology founders were extremely liberal on social issues like gay marriage, abortion and gun control, I question whether the same can be said for more recent social divides around transgender rights, racial equity and the penumbra of other issues surrounding the concept of “wokeness.” And as the pandemic emptied offices, many tech executives spoke out against lockdown policies that were popular among the left. The venture capitalist David Sacks, who supported Gov. Gavin Newsom of California in 2018, donated to the effort to recall the governor in 2021 because of Covid policies, among other issues.

At the same time, the growing, uncontrolled power of Big Tech was fomenting concern on the left. The same social-media platforms that were credited with boosting Mr. Obama in 2008 were blamed for helping Donald Trump in 2016. As populist voices like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have gained prominence, so too have concerns with the wealthy tech community and powerful monopolies. Democratic senators across the political spectrum, from Elizabeth Warren to Amy Klobuchar, have proposed legislation reining in Big Tech."

The spectacular failure of House Republicans to elect a speaker in the first round of voting on Tuesday, the first such failure in 100 years, plunged half of the nation’s legislature into limbo, where it remains as of this writing. But eventually, Republicans will choose a leader, the 118th Congress will be sworn in, and the Democratic Party’s federal trifecta will end.

For at least the next two years, given Democratic control of the Senate and the presidential veto, neither party will be able to pass legislation on its own. But a divided government is not necessarily a stagnant or inconsequential one. How will Republicans use their newfound power, and on which issues might there be policy progress or rollback? Here’s what people are saying.

Go after Biden’s inner circle

The Republicans’ majority in the House, narrow though it is, will give them complete control over the subpoena power, which they intend to use to investigate President Biden, his cabinet and his family, as Democrats did the Trump administration. For many Republicans, “that was the point of the election,” Carl Hulse reported for The Times after the midterm results came in. “Their agenda is investigative, not legislative.”

At the top of that agenda is ratcheting up scrutiny of the president’s son Hunter, whose foreign business dealings have been under investigation by the Justice Department since the Obama administration. A House inquiry would likely be spearheaded by James Comer, Republican of Kentucky, who is expected to chair the House Committee on Oversight and Reform. Comer has claimed that the contents of Hunter Biden’s laptop, which was found abandoned in a Delaware repair shop in 2020, revealed evidence of federal crimes committed by the president’s family."

Two of Cesar Chavez’s favorites: “Loaves and Fishes,” by Dorothy Day, and “Faith and Violence,” by Thomas Merton. Paul Chavez recently recommended them to me to better understand his father’s Catholic-driven worldview. They were just delivered to my house. I’m also planning to read Keith O’Brien’s “Paradise Falls” (about the Love Canal environmental catastrophe of 1978 in Niagara Falls, N.Y.) and Juan Gonzalez’s “Harvest of Empire” (documenting the history of Latinos in the United States) for professional purposes.

My well-worn copy of “The Gary Snyder Reader,” an omnibus from our greatest spokesperson for wild nature, is a permanent night stand fixture. The way his poetry synthesizes ecological wisdom and Native American ritual with Buddhist teachings has become hard-wired into my makeup. I keep this volume handy to read before bedtime. His poem “For the Children” offers this pearl of wisdom: “stay together / learn the flowers / go light.”

What’s the last great book you read?

During the pandemic I was transfixed by George R. Stewart’s “Earth Abides,” perhaps the most frightening doomsday thriller of all time. Most of American civilization collapses because of a strange disease, but a Berkeley ecologist is one of the rare survivors of the epidemic. Stewart wrote the book about 75 years ago, but his description of empty cities and the power of nature unleashed seem very contemporary in a world of Covid and climate change. It holds up well, and Kim Stanley Robinson wrote a fine introduction for the 2020 edition.

Are there any classic novels that you only recently read for the first time?

Penguin Classics recently reprinted “Dirty Bird Blues,” by Clarence Major, in a 25th-anniversary edition. Major’s character Manfred “Man” Banks is a gritty 1950s blues harmonica player and singer grinding out a living in racist, hard-dollar Chicago and Omaha. The book’s folkloric street slang is pitch-perfect, and Major deserves much wider recognition for his career as a novelist, painter, poet and explainer of the Black experience in America. This is ultrarealism at its finest."

The storms inflicted widespread flooding and killed at least 20 people. The onslaught of precipitation also started to refill reservoirs and pile up snowpack in the Sierra Nevada.

Simultaneous flooding and drought are “basically a byproduct of the high variability of California’s climate,” said Jay Lund, co-director of the Center for Watershed Sciences at the University of California, Davis.

The state typically gets its precipitation during the late fall and winter, much of it from storms fueled by atmospheric rivers, and can go long periods of time in the spring and summer without any rain.

California has built its water infrastructure — reservoirs, wells and irrigation systems — in part to account for the imbalanced timing in precipitation. However, the state’s strategy of capturing water during wet periods and reserving it for dry periods gets “more difficult to implement because of the extremes becoming greater” in a warming climate, Dr. Lund said.

The recent rains resulted in a quick and heavy influx of water into many of the state’s reservoirs. Many have returned to or surpassed average levels, but few are at full capacity.

If reservoir levels continue to creep up above average levels, it could alleviate some deficits that have accumulated over consecutive extreme drought years, said Molly White, an operations manager for the California State Water Project.

“It all helps the overall drought picture,” she added.

California has a naturally variable climate: Periods of drought are punctuated by periods of wetter weather. But research suggests that global warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions is making it more likely that any given drought will persist or become more intense, and less likely that any string of wet years will continue.

Climate change will also worsen the wettest extremes. Because warmer air can carry more moisture, atmospheric rivers, which are essentially long plumes of water vapor, will also be able to unleash larger cargoes of precipitation.

The winter is typically the rainy season for California, the time of year when many of the state’s aquifers get recharged with precipitation. But snowmelt that begins in the spring and continues throughout the summer is crucial in refilling aquifers, too, typically providing about 30 percent of the water supply for the state.

The recent storm systems have been the biggest contributor to the snow accumulation in the Sierra Nevada so far this winter. A number of monitoring stations have measured record amounts of snow water equivalent (the amount of liquid water available in snow) for this time of year, reaching seasonal highs usually not seen until late April, when snowpack usually peaks.

On Jan. 17, the recorded snow water equivalent was double what it was last year on the same date, according to data from the California Department of Water Resources.

Storms Build Up California’s Snowpack Average snowpack levels statewide reached seasonal highs usually not seen until April. A chart shows average snow water equivalent levels for each water year from 2003 through Jan. 17, 2023. Levels for Jan. 17 are about double what they were last year on the same date. 45 Previous years since 2003 40 35 This year 30 25 20 15 Last year 10 5 inches Aug. April June Feb. Dec. Oct.

Atmospheric rivers don’t always bring more snow; storms can actually shrink the snowpack if precipitation falls as rain instead of snow at high elevations. That may happen more frequently as the climate continues to warm.

“Snowpack is in pretty good shape right now,” said Rich Tinker, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service and an author on the latest U.S. Drought Monitor report. “But how it melts is going to be important.” Snow melt usually happens in a slow, stable way, but if temperatures rise quickly, that stability can change, he said.

Last year, an unusually wet early winter ultimately gave way to several dry months that led to restrictions on water use in the summer. Research shows that climate warming and unseasonably warm temperatures in the spring and summer have contributed to an earlier thaw season and more rapid melting.

California’s recent spate of storms will not reverse three years that have been the state’s driest on record. It’s taken multiple years to get to the current state of persistent drought, said Gus Goodbody, a hydrologist at the United States Department of Agriculture’s National Water and Climate Center. “It’s going to be hard for a single season to counteract that.”"

There will be another effort to bring around Mr. Erdogan before the two-day summit kicks off on Tuesday. The NATO secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, is scheduled to meet on Monday with Mr. Erdogan, and Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson of Sweden."

The toll of the war in Ukraine, and how the rest of Europe can best help, is expected to be a major focus of the gathering — only the fourth since the council was established in 1949, after World War II. Leaders from many of the council’s 46 member nations are expected in person, but President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, who has been on a whirlwind tour of Europe in recent days, attended virtually.

“Ukraine must take center stage” at the summit, the council’s secretary general, Marija Pejcinovic Buric, said in a statement. She added that “accountability for the death and destruction caused by Russian aggression is vital,” suggesting that the organization could take a leading role in establishing a record to document evidence and claims of damage, loss or injury in Ukraine as a result of Russia’s invasion.

Russia became a member of the council in 1996, in the years following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, but was suspended from it last year after attacking Ukraine. The invasion “goes against everything we stand for and is a violation of our statute and of the European Convention on Human Rights,’’ Ms. Buric told The Times in March 2022."

In 2020, the International Energy Agency projected that the global share of electric vehicle sales would not top 10 percent before 2030. It appears we’ve already crossed that bar eight years early, and BloombergNEF now projects that the market share of E.V.s will approach 40 percent by the end of the decade. (The I.E.A. is less bullish but has still roughly doubled its 2030 projection in just two years.) The underlying production capacity is perhaps even more encouraging. In the United States, investments in battery manufacturing reached a record $73 billion last year — three times as much as the previous record, set the year before. Globally, battery manufacturing capacity grew almost 40 percent last year, and is projected to grow fivefold by just 2025. By that year, lithium mining is expected to be triple what it was in 2021.

We’ve seen this phenomenon before, with many other areas of the green transition experiencing similarly shocking exponential or quasi-exponential growth: renewable energy investments in the United States quadrupling in a decade, global investments in clean tech growing more than 30-fold over the same period, a solar supply chain already big enough to facilitate a total transition. It’s enough to make many optimistic observers giddy with anticipation of what’s to come.

What is to come?

It is tempting to believe that designing a future is as simple as drawing the right trajectory on a whiteboard. But as with everything else when it comes to climate, the challenge is bigger than that — indeed, the fact that trend lines are beginning to point in the right direction can be a kind of false comfort, since technologies like these don’t just descend from the cloud onto the world’s phones. And the scientist Vaclav Smil’s gloomy comparisons to previous energy transitions aside, the world hasn’t undertaken a breakneck allover revolution like this ever before in its history. Do the familiar, S-shaped learning curves of technological adaptation mean that it should be very easy, and indeed remunerative, for the world to get on track to limit warming below two degrees Celsius, or even 1.5 degrees, as a much talked about paper produced by Oxford’s Institute for New Economic Thinking has suggested? Or, as the scholar Jessica Jewell has argued in the journal Nature Energy and elsewhere, do the limitations of practical obstacles and political economy mean that, even assuming those encouraging learning curves, much more would have to be done to ensure technological adoption at that speed?

Here the E.V. revolution is an illuminating case study. To stabilize global temperatures, we have to get emissions basically all the way down to zero, not just reduce them — an interesting November paper in the journal Geophysical Research Letters suggests it might be better to aim for “approximately” net zero emissions, since it may be the case that global temperatures could stabilize even if emissions aren’t entirely eliminated. To do that, we need to stop burning fossil fuels in cars, not just supplement the existing fleet with slightly more green alternatives. A rapid growth in market share isn’t itself sufficient, in other words, because — like carbon itself, which hangs in the air for centuries at least — dirty cars stay on the road for a very long time, emitting all the while.

Economists call this a problem of stocks rather than flows. In this case, while the “flows” are indeed impressive, the “stock” of E.V.s on the road is probably only 2 percent of the global fleet, which still isn’t close to 100 percent at all."

As the sector’s decade of hypergrowth came to an end, start-ups died, tech giants cut perks and laid off workers, and investors’ dreams of a new, crypto-fied internet known as “web3” faded into oblivion.

In recent weeks, a deluge of rumors and distortions have taken aim at Mr. Moreno’s proposal. Driven in part by climate change deniers and backers of the QAnon conspiracy theory, false claims have circulated online, at protests and even in government hearings that 15-minute cities were a precursor to “climate change lockdowns” — urban “prison camps” in which residents’ movements would be surveilled and heavily restricted.

Many attacked Mr. Moreno, 63, directly. The professor, who teaches at the University of Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne, faced harassment in online forums and over email. He was accused without evidence of being an agent of an invisible totalitarian world government. He was likened to criminals and dictators."

Some tourists in Lahaina have said that at 4:17 p.m., there was an emergency alert to their cellphones for the first time informing them of the fire. Many local residents have said that they didn’t know the flames were approaching until the fire was nearby. We know from New York Times reporting that by 5:19 p.m. the fire had reached the waterfront, and that by 5:33 people were seeking shelter in the water.

If the text alerts were sent out at 4:17 p.m., that was at least 47 minutes too late. It appears that the evacuation order for the entire area was not issued when the road was closed or soon after. Wasn’t anyone thinking of the possibility of a runaway fire with no air support because of strong winds? According to a Facebook post by the County of Maui, a fire first reported at 6:37 a.m. east of Lahaina on the same day prompted evacuation orders in that area three minutes later.

Fires spread at rates dependent on vegetation, slope and wind conditions, but the way this one appears to have spread from the road to the beach was not an anomaly. In Mati, Greece, in 2018, a fire took about half an hour to cover one-half mile. The conditions there were similar to Maui’s, with very strong winds descending from the local mountains and pushing the fire forward. In Mati, there was no warning; 104 people died and roughly another 800 were trapped by the beach and had to be evacuated from the water. With an alert system, those lives might not have been lost. It was another tragedy that could have been prevented.

Scientists have warned time and again that we have yet to see the end of fires like the ones in Lahaina and Mati as climate change and extreme weather create riskier conditions. But it is unreasonable to expect any single state or local fire service to be able to mobilize the resources to battle a fire without help from the outside world. What’s worse, these incidents often happen simultaneously. On Maui alone, firefighters were battling fires near Makawao and Kula when the Lahaina fire erupted, leaving the ranks depleted.

Islands are at a particular disadvantage because of their insularity: Reinforcements have to be flown in and may take too long to arrive. But there is a better way. Europe has had some success in recent years prepositioning firefighters in high-risk areas, like the Greek islands, during the hottest and driest summer months. Hiring seasonal firefighters has also helped some communities there and elsewhere prepare. Hawaii, with help from the federal government, could improve its firefighting resources in these ways, too."

Ukraine has tacitly acknowledged that Russia has seized Bakhmut: A Ukrainian official said today that Russian forces are engaged in “mopping up” operations to clear the remaining Ukrainian soldiers in the city — even as Kyiv seeks to shift the focus from the apparent loss to the battle for the city’s outskirts.

The recent comments signaled a shift in how Ukraine is portraying the war’s deadliest campaign. For months, even as its hold on Bakhmut shrank to a few blocks, Ukraine would emphasize fierce fighting to keep the Russians from seizing the city. Officials now appear to be acknowledging that their focus is changing from defending Bakhmut to making it difficult for Russians to hold it.

But Bakhmut itself is destroyed. Drone footage captured by The Times shows the once-peaceful city, known for its salt mines and sparkling wine, reduced to ashes.

“By the time Russia declared victory over the ruins, it was clear the city was all but lost,” said our colleague Marc Santora, who reported from the Bakhmut region last week. “At the same time, a different battle is playing out around the city — this one for the high ground taken by Russian forces over the winter.”"

So before we jump in today, I want to tell you about something The New York Times has been working on for a while. And I’m going to level with you — that when they started telling me about this project, I was very skeptical of it, which made for a couple of awkward internal conversations, because what I understood them to be working on was a podcast app. And I thought to myself, who needs another podcast app? There are plenty of them on the market already. None of them are great, but they’re fine. And then they gave me the new app as a beta tester, and I realized that I was wrong about what they were building, at least partly wrong, because what they actually built is something nobody has created yet, which is a portal to the world of audio journalism. There are podcasts, including this one, but also stories, essays, profiles. You can listen to digests of the news, and to full news stories, and to full magazine stories. You don’t have to choose anymore between listening to a podcast and actually getting the news. You can get the news you used to read, but done in a really, really strong, really professional audio format, and not just from The New York Times. There are stories there from other publishers too. So the app, again, is called New York Times Audio. It’s an iOS app. You get it from the App Store. And it is for New York Times news subscribers, which — come on, if you’re listening to this show, I hope you’re a subscriber for that by now. So check it out. It really is something new. It really is something worth trying. [MUSIC PLAYING] I’m going to start today’s show with some numbers. Between 2011 and 2021, the number of teens and young adults with clinical depression more than doubled — more than doubled. Between 2007 and 2019, the suicide rate for those in their early 20s rose by 41 percent. And the suicide rate for 10 to 14-year-olds — 10 to 14-year-olds, think about how young that is — it tripled, and it nearly quadrupled for girls. A C.D.C. survey found that in 2021, almost 60 percent of high school girls experienced persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness during the past year, and nearly 25 percent — I just, this number, man — nearly 25 percent made a suicide plan. Something is going terribly wrong for teenagers. Whatever it is started well before the pandemic. And this is important enough and big enough that we’re going to do a couple of episodes exploring it. But I wanted our first one to really try to dig into these numbers. What do we know is happening here? Why is it happening? You can’t begin to solve a problem like this, until at least you have a theory of what has been causing it. Jean Twenge is a research psychologist who has been deep in this data for years. She was one of the earliest to see something going wrong with teen mental health. And then in her 2017 book, “iGen” and her new book “Generations,” she’s put together reams of charts and graphs and theories and tests to try to understand what it is, what has happened here. And the leading candidate, in her view, is smartphones and social media. And if that’s true, if they really are doing this level of damage to kids today, then we need to be thinking about interventions here on a whole different scale than most policymakers have been willing to touch. And I want to say this episode obviously deals a lot with suicide, and if you or someone you know or love is struggling here, get help. There is a lot of help out there. So call or text 988 to reach the suicide and crisis lifeline. As always, my email, ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. [MUSIC PLAYING] Jean Twenge, welcome to the show.

jean twenge

Thank you.

ezra klein

So in your new book, “Generations,” you write, “that there’s a full blown mental health crisis among young people, and it was building long before the Covid-19 pandemic.” So walk me through some of the data — and your book is really chock-full of data and graphs, which I really appreciated about it. Walk me through some of the data that persuaded you of that.

jean twenge

Yeah, so I work with these large national surveys, often of teens. And I’ve been doing that for a number of years. So when I first started to see these trends, they were surprising, because they were so sudden. So around 2012, more and more teens started to say they felt lonely and left out. And more started to say they felt like they couldn’t do anything right, or that they didn’t enjoy life. Those last two are classic symptoms of depression. Then, other data started to pop up. Clinical level depression that requires treatment started to rise. Emergency room admissions for self-harm started to rise in C.D.C. data. Same thing for suicide attempts and completed suicides. So at first, I thought it might be a blip, a year or two of data. But it kept going. So for example, between 2011 and 2019, well before the pandemic, clinical level depression among teens doubled. Emergency room admissions for self harm tripled in 10 to 14-year-old girls. So this is why I say we know it’s not just the pandemic.

ezra klein

And those objective measures of behavior, is that one of the ways we know? Because I think this is a common suspicion at about this point in the conversation, that we’re not just dealing with a rise in reporting or a decrease in stigma — maybe it’s much easier to say and admit that you’re depressed than it was in 1985.

jean twenge

So exactly, that’s how we know it’s not just about more willingness to report, is that these objective measures, like the emergency room admissions for — not just for self harm, but also for suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts, have gone up. And the pattern is extremely similar to the self reports. I mean, the other thing that has to be kept in mind about these self reports is these surveys are anonymous. Many of them also ask about drug and alcohol use, all of which is illegal in these age groups. So these surveys better than anybody know how to make sure to get across to young people how confidential. It is.

ezra klein

What are we seeing in terms of the demographic differences here between boys and girls, among races, classes, geographies? Are there patterns being picked up there that are worth noting?

jean twenge

So the biggest difference is boys versus girls, and it varies a little bit from one measure to another. So for clinical level depression, it’s doubled for both girls and boys. But because teen girls’ rates of depression are and were always higher, the number of people that this affects is larger for girls. And then in many of the other measures we’ve been discussing, the changes are considerably larger for girls than for boys, so self-harm behaviors is one of those where there’s not as much change for boys as there is for girls. Same is true for the suicide rate, that it has changed for both, but it has changed more and increased more among girls than among boys.

ezra klein

I want to zoom in here on suicide itself. You compare the actual suicide rate increases between 2007, not that long ago, and 2019. And you say of the increase, quote, it’s a total of 17,677 additional young lives lost, averaging more than 1,300 a year, enough to fill nine planes. Imagine if nine airline flights filled with 10 to 24-year-olds crashed every single year, killing everyone on board. That’s a really profound and shocking rise. So how do you understand the rise in suicide itself?

jean twenge

So I think we have to look at the pattern across all of the measures, so not just suicide, but also those ER admissions for self harm, the rise in depression, the rise in anxiety, the rise in unhappiness. And across the board, all of these indicators have gotten worse in terms of mental health. And the pattern is fairly similar, that around 2010 or so, these indicators start to get worse. Now, the exact time when they start to increase varies a little bit from one measure to another, sometime between 2009 and 2013. It’s right in that time period. So you have to ask, what happened during that time period, because we’re not trying to explain all of the causes of mental health issues among teens. We want to know why it increased so much over such a short period of time. So it has to be something that changed around that time, and then kept going in the same direction over the next decade or so. So when I first started to see these changes, I had absolutely no idea what the cause could be. It was pretty clear it was not economics, because the U.S. economy finally started to improve after about 2011, after the Great Recession. It was difficult to think of any major event that occurred around that time and then reverberated throughout the decade. And then one day, I came across the results of a poll from the Pew Center for Research. And it showed that the end of 2012 was the first time that the majority of Americans owned a smartphone, and these same surveys of teens, that time period was also when social media use moved from something that about half of teens were doing every day — it was in 2009 — to by 2015, 2016, about 80 percent of them were doing it every day. So then basically, what happened is social media use moved from optional to almost mandatory among teens. So that’s when I started to think maybe that had something to do with it, that teens were spending so much more time online — also, because this lined up with other things. Like, they were also sleeping less. The trend isn’t exactly the same pattern. That started to increase after 2011 or 2012. And they also started spending less time with their friends in person, so that had started to decline just a little bit after about 2000 and then it really falls off a cliff after 2010. So you put this together, there was a fundamental change in the way teens spent their time outside of school starting in that same time period, early 2010s. And that coincides, with pretty good precision, with when mental health started to suffer.

ezra klein

So before we go deep into the smartphone thesis, I want to zoom in on something you said there about the data, which is that we’re trying to explain a change in the time series — right, there’s this very sharp — just, the line goes almost straight up, starting, as you say, around like 2011, 2012. But something that was striking when we were doing prep for this was, I saw this figure from the researchers Will Rinehart and Taylor Barkley. And they found that if you go back to the late 1960s and you graph the teen suicide rate, it looks more cyclical, rather than a trend just going upward. So it’s higher in the ‘80s than now, than it falls for a long time until about 2008. And then it picks up again, getting us to where we are now. So if we’re kind of explaining the rise, how do we also explain the fall that preceded it? I mean, there are no smartphones in the 1980s. So what do you understand as having gone on in the ‘80s that led to such a high suicide rate, and then stopped happening, such that it went down to what we’re now thinking of as a more normal baseline?

jean twenge

So it is true that the suicide rate for teens in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s was very high. It was much higher than it was, say, for Boomer teens in 1970. So one thing we have to keep in mind here is just the greater cultural context, that there was a big rise in violent crime around this time. It was kind of a disordered time in the culture, so this — there was a recession. This is around the time that Bill Clinton’s 1992 campaign kept talking about change because it was such a pessimistic time in the country. And for teens in particular, and we’re talking about suicides in particular, there’s another element — so there was a huge availability of inexpensive guns around that time. So they were called Saturday Night Specials. And when you break it down for firearm suicides versus non, non firearm suicides went down or didn’t change a whole lot during that time period when it was the Gen X-ers who were teens. It was really that increase in the firearm suicides, so it may have had a fair amount to do with the preponderance of cheap guns.

ezra klein

So one of your big thesis throughout generations is that generations are technologically mediated, that more than they’re defined by cultural events, they’re defined by the technologies they have accessible to them. So your thinking on this is that technology that was mediating that was guns. But then why would it fall?

jean twenge

Well, the folks that looked at this concluded that there were more restrictions starting in the mid ‘90s. And what I do know for sure, the violent crime rate definitely started to go down after about — 1993 was the peak, and then things started to improve. And they kept improving for a really long time. So I still think that general atmosphere of that time — it was really a tough time to be a teen, particularly if — you know, depending on the neighborhood were in, but particularly if you were in a place that was impacted by this very, very high level of violent crime.

ezra klein

Violent crime actually gets at why I wanted to ask this before we got into smartphones, because I’m much more familiar with the debate over crime than I am over the debate over suicide trend lines. And the thing that has always striking to me, and I think really underplayed in our national discourse over crime, is that we don’t really understand it, that if you go into the ‘80s and the ‘90s, you see crime goes way, way up in the 70s, way, way up in all kinds of different jurisdictions, more or less all at the same time. And then it begins going way, way down in all kinds of different places all at the same time. So you have stories that people know, like there’s New York with Rudy Giuliani and broken windows policing and stop and frisk. But it also goes down in all these places that didn’t do what New York City did. It’s so widespread, both the rise and the fall, that you end up having researchers trying to think of even broader explanations, like whether or not lead and the amount of lead in young kids’ bloodstreams — and thus, the effect on their executive function when they got older, maybe that’s the causal mechanism. And it made me wonder if there isn’t a chance that suicide and teen mental health is like that, that it has this kind of all the way up, all the way down in all places, and we don’t really understand why pattern to it.

jean twenge

Well, I think — and I think your point is very well taken about crime rates, that they are a little bit of a mystery. It’s also true, sure, that for mental health, we can’t randomly assign people to be born at different times and then see what their mental health looks like. That would be the gold standard of or random assignment experiment. And it’s literally impossible. So we have to go on the data that we have. But I think for the recent rise in mental health issues, we can look at it this way, that this is a generation where violent crime is a lot lower than it was in the early ‘90s. Teen pregnancy was lower. They’re even less likely to get into car accidents or get into physical fights at school. Incomes were up for that period. There’s all these things that were going right, yet still, mental health among teens suffered. So there must have been some big mechanism. The reason why I think the smartphones and social media explanation has held up is because that is what had the biggest impact on the day to day lives of teens. It wasn’t something that happened to their parents. It wasn’t a single thing they read about in the news. It completely restructured their time outside of school because social media is social. It impacts even people who don’t use it. And it had a huge impact on the way teens spent time with their friends, that they started spending a lot less time with each other, face to face. And you think about what’s important for mental health overall, it’s relationships. Then, you think about teens in particular, that is what makes or breaks mental health for a teen, is their relationships, particularly their friendships. And the way those friendships were conducted changed completely.

ezra klein

So I want to dig into this piece of it more, because smartphones sound like a singular cause. But when I read you on this, and when I read others, it decomposes into something very multi causal. So tell me the different mechanisms. You talk about time displacement, and social effects, and time spent with friends, and sleep. What are the different mechanisms that you understand smartphones as triggering that contribute to this for you?

jean twenge

There are a lot of different mechanisms. It’s another reason why it is such a plausible explanation. So as we’ve already talked about, there’s the time displacement — not just with in person interactions with friends, but also with sleep. Sleep is absolutely crucial for mental health. Not sleeping enough is a huge risk factor for depression and suicidal thoughts. And sleep deprivation among teens in two different surveys shows exactly the same pattern as the mental health issues, which is around 2012 or so it starts going up. So that’s our first couple of mechanisms.

ezra klein

And just hold on that one for a minute. What makes you certain that that isn’t just correlation with the take off in smartphones? What makes you think that smartphones are directly leading to less sleep for teens?

jean twenge

So there’s many correlational and experimental studies, say, in sleep labs showing that, for example, people have their phones in their bedrooms overnight, that that disrupts sleep, that looking at a device before bedtime leads to less sleep and less quality sleep. So because — for a number of reasons. First, they’re psychologically stimulating. Pretty much everything people do on the phone is psychologically stimulating, particularly for teens, where the number of likes they got on their Instagram post, or whether they’re crush texted them back is very important. These are not relaxing thoughts, yet many, many, many teens are looking at their phones right up until they go to sleep. Plus, there’s a physiological element. The blue light on those devices shines into your eyes, tricks your brain into thinking it’s still daytime. And then you don’t make as much melatonin, the sleep hormone that you need to fall asleep quickly and get a good night’s sleep. And this is correlational, experimental — that piece of the research literature is extremely solid, on that connection between spending time on the devices and not sleeping enough.

ezra klein

All right, so that is smartphones and sleep. What are the other mechanisms?

jean twenge

So there’s all of the things that happen when a teen uses social media. So we can start with things like social comparison and body image issues. So this is what Facebook’s own research shows, as well as plenty of external academic research as well, that looking at, say, these ideal bodies on Instagram, or even the people you go to high school with, and they look more glamorous, and you’re comparing your body to theirs, and your appearance to theirs and coming up short. So that’s the social comparison piece, and lots of studies on this, that people that spend more time, and especially those who spend more time looking at those images on Instagram, if they have that tendency towards social comparison, that’s where you get the body image issues, appearance issues. And then those — mediated, those can then lead to depression. And in Facebook’s research, they had a bunch of focus groups as well as large surveys, and they found this over and over. And the focus group quotes, some of them were really stunning. They would talk about a grief spiral, and they start looking at these images, feel inadequate, then get depressed. Then, there’s all of the other things that people have discussed about the influence of social media, that it means popularity becomes a number — how many likes do you have, how many followers do you have. And it’s never enough. Then, cyberbullying — some of the rabbit holes that people end up going down, that has been documented. If you start looking for healthy eating, you might end up on pro anorexia sites, and there’s no way to reset that. And that negative material keeps showing up. Same thing for a lot of things around mental health. And again, it just becomes a spiral.

ezra klein

One thing about smartphones is they’re an international phenomenon. So is social media. So what do you see in the international data here?

jean twenge

So in the international data, we see exactly the same pattern as we see in the U.S. for teen mental health, that in 36 countries around the world, adolescent loneliness began to increase after 2012, just like it does in the U.S. data. We have solid data on depression and unhappiness in English speaking countries — again, exact same pattern — so in the U.K., in Australia, in Canada, exact same pattern for teens for anxiety and depression, self harm, unhappiness. It’s very, very consistent. And that also suggests some cause that was worldwide. That helps us rule out more U.S.-based explanations, like worries around school shootings, which tend not to happen in other countries, and certain political events.

ezra klein

How does the smartphone thesis map on to — not just the observation, the reality, that this has been much worse among girls than boys?

jean twenge

Well, girls spend more time on social media. And time on social media is more strongly linked to depression than time spent on, say, gaming, which is where boys spend more of their screen time. So those two factors, they spend more time on it, and it’s more strongly linked to depression for them — might explain the gender difference.

ezra klein

I found that pretty striking. Why do you think gaming is not as linked to some of these negative outcomes?

jean twenge

These days, the way most teens and adults game, it’s often interactive. So they’ll play games with their friends. They aren’t there face to face, but it’s often in real time. And they’ll often talk to each other as they’re playing the game. So not the same as running around outside playing football, say, but still in real time, and still interaction with friends, where on social media, only some of it is interaction with friends. A good amount of it is watching TikTok videos from people you’ve never met, or scanning through the pages of Instagram influencers.

ezra klein

This is one thing I was trying to sit with as I read the book, and thought about this data, that gaming has this tendency to be not just interactive, but it’s you doing it, it’s you doing something, where social media has this weird tendency to put you outside yourself, looking in. I mean, you’ve talked about it as comparative, but it’s also — you’re posting pictures, you’re writing things, and then seeing how people respond. You’re always putting yourself out for judgment. And you begin to inhabit the judger in a weird way. I mean, I’ve certainly felt this myself. And I did not get social media when I was a 13-year-old. Is there something to that, the way that gaming keeps you in yourself, and social media it takes you outside yourself?

jean twenge

I think so. It reminds me of some of the research on what’s called self objectification in terms of appearance, that particularly for women, there’s the pressure to focus on how your body looks to others, rather than what your body can do, say, in terms of sports or other things. And it’s somewhat of the same element, because in gaming, you can do things. And maybe you’re going to fail, and maybe your friends will make fun of you. But still, you’re doing something. You have at least some perceived level of control. And in social media, there is that same perceived level of control. However, there’s only so far you can go to modify your appearance and try to measure up to all the perfect people who you see online. And you’re right, it’s about — so much more about the judgment of others than it is about what you’re doing.

ezra klein

How much is social media also simply a vector for contagion of antisocial behaviors themselves, or depressive and anxious and self harming thoughts and patterns themselves? And I mean something very specific here. So back in the day when I covered more school shootings, there was an argument not to use the names of school shooters, sometimes not even — you would actually get the argument not to cover them, because there is a well known copycat effect. There’s also a well known effect like that around suicide. People know that the more they hear about suicide, the likelier suicide is to occur to others. There’s a Netflix show about the suicide of a teen called “13 Reasons Why,” and there was a big debate, including some research, about whether or not that itself increased suicide among teens. And so there’s an argument out there that as people are exposed to simply the knowledge that other people are doing these things — killing themselves, killing others, hurting themselves, hurting others — that that itself is enough for more people to do it. And anybody who’s spent time on social media also sees a lot more just discussion of anxiety, discussion of depression, those feelings as interpretive frameworks for your own feelings becomes more at hand. So how much is it just possible here that you’re seeing contagion as a force gathering its own momentum, that people are more connected to others having these kinds of experiences, and so they’re having more of them themselves?

jean twenge

I think that might explain some of the acceleration in the trend, or part of it. I don’t think it can explain why it started to begin with. So yeah, I think we have to consider that there was an origin to this, because — you know, why couldn’t it be that people are talking about how optimistic or happy they are online, and that becomes contagious. So I had to start somewhere, because there was that very sudden shift from millennials being self confident and optimistic as teens to Gen Z being not. And it happened very quickly. It was a much more stark generational difference than I’ve really documented in my whole career.

ezra klein

So I want to note that there are some studies that have looked at this and found very little effect, or no effect, or reverse effect. There’s a 2019 study in Nature Human Behavior that found, quote, the association we find between digital technology use and adolescent well-being is negative but small, explaining at most 0.4 percent of the variation in well-being. There’s a 2018 study in Psychiatric Quarterly that also found very unremarkable results. You’ve kept, along with Jon Haidt and some others, this online compendium of studies on teen mental health. So when you see these studies, and there are a good number of them that come out and say, we checked into this, and we just can’t find anything significant or big here, how do you interpret what’s happening in them? And if they do, how do they change your priors?

jean twenge

So that 2019 Nature Human Behavior study has been pretty thoroughly debunked, because three other research groups analyzed the same data and found there was actually a very strong link between social media and depression, especially among girls, in that same data. It was very interesting. The same month that study came out, another research group in the U.K. used the same data set and found that three times as many heavy users of social media were depressed as non-users among girls. That’s not small. So then I and then another research group from Spain, who I have no connection to, later used the same, more sophisticated statistical technique that those authors did in the Nature Human Behavior paper, and we both independently came to the same conclusion, that first, there was some very strange methodological choices in that 2019 paper. And also, that if you zero in on social media, and if you zero in on girls, there are definitely significant and impactful differences. If — I know the 2018 “Psychiatric Quarterly” paper that you’re discussing. I reanalyzed that data for a paper recently — same thing. And it also turns out if you take that data and look at it in a more intuitive way, of — let’s just look at the percentage who are depressed at every level of social media use, it’s extremely common to find that pattern, that those who don’t use social media or use it only lightly compared to those who use it heavily, that there’s twice as many in the heavy use group, particularly among girls, who are depressed, compared to the light or no use group. So these papers that say, you know, oh, there’s nothing here often are just are looking at screen time overall. That 2019 paper included owning a computer. It also included watching TV, so they often don’t zero in on social media. They often don’t break down the data by boys versus girls. And they take correlations that translate to that doubling of depression and say, oh, that’s small. And I just don’t see how you could consider that small, to have twice as many who are depressed.

ezra klein

Tell me a bit more, actually, about that screen time question, because one thing you’ll hear in this conversation is we had a big moral panic about television. And it turns out that a lot of us grew up watching a lot of television, and many of us at least think we are fine. Maybe we are not.

jean twenge

I would argue that point, actually, but that may be a whole other discussion.

ezra klein

I sort of agree with you, that I think, actually, a bunch of the TV people were right about this, but tell me about that, because there is nevertheless, in the data as I understand it, a finding at this point that television does not seem to have the level of significant negative effects on mental health that social media does. But — so I’d first like to hear your point on, maybe we’re not fine because television messed with our brains. And then, I’d like to hear the difference between what you see in the data on using a screen for television and using it for social media.

jean twenge

So the impacts of television, is not quite as much for mental health, per se, as it is for things like the feeling of community, materialism, the amount people read, the national discourse and how tolerant it is of more complex arguments. These are all a lot of the things that we lost to television — social skills, I mean you can go on. Robert Putnam’s book “Bowling Alone” basically says, yes, it’s television, that’s why we don’t have all these community groups like we used to. But for mental health, for the moment, yes, if you spend a lot of time watching TV, you are more likely to be depressed. That is still true. It’s just that link is considerably smaller, so spending three hours watching TV is not as linked to depression as spending three hours on social media, for example.

ezra klein

So there’s an observation here, as you just mentioned, that how much people use is very highly correlated to what the effect of their use seems to be. But something you’ll hear about that is that maybe that goes the other way, maybe you watch a lot of TV because you’re depressed, because you don’t have other good options. Maybe you’re on social media all the time because you don’t have other friends. Maybe the causal arrow is going in the other direction, and particularly social media in this case, though TV in another era, and for some people even now, that you’re on there a lot because things are not going well for you already. It’s not that things are not going well for you because you’re on there a lot. How do you think about that?

jean twenge

So there’s two different questions here. So one is that overall pattern of, say, teen depression increasing so much after 2012. So there, it seems pretty clear that it’s technology leading to depression, rather than the other way around, because if it was depression causing technology use, you’d have to say this. You’d have to say, OK, teen depression started to increase for some completely unknown reason nobody’s been able to figure out yet. And that’s why teens started to buy smartphones and spend a lot of time on social media. Like, it just doesn’t work. So it seems pretty clear that at the generational level, we’re not getting reverse causation. Now, at the individual level, sure, that’s a more plausible explanation. But we have a good amount of experimental data now to suggest that at least some, and probably most of the causation is going from the technology use to depression. So a couple of examples, there’s been several studies that have asked people to either give up or cut back on their social media use. Those who gave up social media are happier and less depressed than those who continued their normal use. There’s also a really cool study that takes advantage of, basically, a natural experiment that Facebook rolled out at different times on different college campuses. And they documented that as a campus got Facebook, the mental health among the students on that campus started to suffer. [MUSIC PLAYING]

ezra klein

So I want to look at some of the other broad theories, because you can buy the smartphone thesis broadly, and I do, and still wonder if there’s not other causal mechanisms happening here. One you will hear a lot is that we’re not seeing a mental health crisis. We’re seeing — let’s call it a reality crisis. One version of this is that teens today are upset and depressed and anxious because of economic prospects, because they’re coming-of-age in an era when capitalism is going awry, because they’re coming-of-age in an era of climate crisis, and wars, and Donald Trump. Tell me how you take that argument, that this is in some ways, a rational response to a declining reality.

jean twenge

So first, I think we have to take a step back and look at the broad picture. Is living right now, in 2023, really worse than it was, say, in March 2020, at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic? Is it really worse than, say, the millennials graduating from college during the Great Recession? Is it worse than 1992 or ‘93, during the height of the violent crime wave? Is it worse than in the ‘80s, when we thought Russia would drop the bomb tomorrow and the whole world would end? Is it worse than boomers getting drafted into Vietnam? A lot of people would say, well, when you think about it that way, no, it’s not. And then we can take the specific explanations — and I want to be clear. It is, I completely agree, important to consider these alternative explanations and see if they fit the data. So wars — well, if that were the case, wouldn’t you expect teen depression to have been the highest — well, especially, during World War II? No, it was lower by the measures we have then. And then more recently, then you’d expect teen depression to be the highest when we were at war in Iraq and Afghanistan. And instead, that’s when we had some of the lowest rates of depression and suicide among teens. Climate change — so one of the things that is in the Gen X chapter of “Generations” is the high school student surveys that ask about concern for the environment. Things like — government should change or ban products to help the environment, they should increase prices and taxes to help the environment, people are going to have to change their way of life to help the environment. So we have data on that between 1976 and 2021. And the peak of those attitudes was in the ‘90s, not recently. So that, I think, argues away from the idea that it would be worries around climate change. Plus, if it was climate change, what you would expect is that you’d see the biggest increases in depression among older adolescents and young adults, where these are issues that they’re talking about at school, they might be reading news. Instead, where we see the biggest increases is among 10 to 14-year-olds, so less likely to fall into that category of placing a lot of importance on issues that affect the nation and the world. All right, so that’s two of them. What were some of the others — economics, median incomes are at an all time highs, adjusted for inflation. The U.S. economy was on a tear between 2011 and 2019, and we see the biggest increase in teen depression. So most of these other things don’t fit the data all that well.

ezra klein

So if we look closer, though, at a kind of an individual issue here, you mentioned gun violence. And there — I think you’ve looked at data on school shooting incidents, times when a gun was brandished or fired on school property, those graphs really do begin to accelerate around your key data of 2012. And yeah, so smartphone use also rises then, but it’s when Sandy Hook happens. And I certainly remember Sandy Hook as a real, horrifyingly watershed moment in this. And you begin having more of these active shooter drills in elementary schools. So I mean Gen Z, kind of this generation that’s having a lot more safety focus and safety issues is coming-of-age routinely often drilling what will happen if somebody is there in their own school with a gun. So I could actually imagine maybe this ricocheting back and forth with social media as these issues are being picked up on smartphones and platforms, and becoming sort of more in the water. But it does feel to me like there is a different political dynamic that younger millennials and certainly Gen Z-ers are swimming in that might make politics more salient. And then, of course, a Trump era that might make politics more salient and fear more salient starting in the smartphone era, in a way that matches the data. I’m curious how you think about that interplay.

jean twenge

I think it’s really clear that it’s not school shootings, because if it were, then we wouldn’t see the increases in depression and self harm in countries where school shootings don’t exist, or are much, much less common than the horrific rate that we experience them in the United States. Yet, we do see that. We see the increases happening around 2012 around the world. So I think that does a pretty good job of ruling out that explanation. Plus, even though maybe if there was a turning point in 2012, well, school shootings were a really big deal in the late ‘90s, too, and teen mental health issues were improving at that time. So I think that also argues against that as an explanation.

ezra klein

While we’re on politics for a minute, one interesting wrinkle in the data here is that liberal teens are quite a bit more unhappy, have more mental health issues than conservative teens. In 2019 to 2021, liberal teens were nearly twice as likely to be depressed as conservative teens. You see this even swamping some of the gender data. So you see liberal boys being more depressed than conservative girls, if I remember this number correctly. So why are liberal teens less happy?

jean twenge

Well, that is a very, very interesting finding. So I dig into that in the book. And I think there’s a couple of possibilities. But the one that I ended up realizing fit the data the best, liberal teens spend more time on social media. And they have increasingly spent less time with each other, face to face. And there’s a bigger change among liberals in spending time with friends face to face. So back in the ‘70s and ‘80s, liberal teens actually spent more time with their friends, face to face, than conservative teens. And right around 2012, that flipped. So there’s a bigger decrease among the liberal girls, for example. So in the end, a good amount of that also is probably due to social media, because some of the other explanations don’t really fit quite as well — because you do still see an increase in depression among conservative teens. It’s just not as large as the increase among liberal teens. So some of the other explanations around politics don’t fit all that well. So here’s two things in that department. One is that if you look at the teens who say that they are interested in government and current affairs, so those are going to be people who are paying attention, you really don’t see a whole lot of difference based on those who are paying attention and those who aren’t. If you break it down by that, and by liberal versus conservative. The other piece is that you see the exact same pattern in loneliness. So loneliness isn’t really something you would expect to be that influenced by political ideology, per se, but it’s probably going to be influenced by how much time you spend with your friends versus on social media. And the pattern for loneliness and the pattern for depression look pretty much exactly the same if you look at it by gender and by political ideology, in terms of it increasing starting around 2010, 2011, and the increase being larger among liberals than among conservatives.

ezra klein

So why would liberal teens be more likely to use social media more than conservative teens? If liberal and conservative are basically picking up some other attribute leading to a disparate use of social media, what do you think is hiding in the correlation there?

jean twenge

Well, liberals, sometimes called progressives, are by definition more comfortable with social change. So liberal teens tend to have liberal parents, conservative teens tend to have conservative parents. Then — this is a guess, but perhaps liberal teens and their parents said, hey, social media, spending time online, that’s just what kids do now. And that’s cool. That’s just the change. That’s just what people do now. And conservative parents might have been more skeptical, and might have had more restrictions on their kids with social media. And that same thing could have interacted with the deface to face social interaction, because once teens start — as a group, anyway — start spending a lot more time online, then the norm shifts to doing that instead of getting together in person.

ezra klein

This gets to a set of broader ideas around parenting, which I associate not only, but substantially, with your co-author on some of this work, Jon Haidt, who’s made the point that we live in a parenting culture that’s increasingly oriented towards safety. And you’ve quite a lot of data about this in the new book, that parents today, much more so than parents a couple of decades ago, are trying to mow any obstacles out of their kids’ way. You have a great line where you talk about how it used to be the 13-year-old was a babysitter, and now a 13-year-old needs a babysitter. What do you see in both the data and the changes around parenting itself? How do you see that playing into this?

jean twenge

So I think it’s important in this case to start with the broader picture, that the theory that I really start with in the book is that technology is at the root of so much generational and cultural change, and that one of the outcomes of technology, because we have better medical care, is longer lives. When people live longer, you tend to get something that psychologists call the slow life strategy, that the entire developmental trajectory slows down from infancy to old age. Kids are less independent. Teenagers are less likely to get their driver’s license, to go out with their friends, to drink alcohol, to have sex, to have a paid job. Young adults take longer to get married and have kids and settle into a career. Middle aged people look and feel younger than their parents and grandparents did at the same age, so 60 is the new 50, this type of idea, because lives last longer, so that trajectory slows down. And that’s not all bad or all good. I mean, let’s focus on teens for a minute. Most parents are pretty thrilled that not as many teens are having sex or drinking alcohol. But it’s not all good, because if they also don’t go out of the house that much without their parents, don’t have a driver’s license, and never had a job, that transition to college or the workplace can be challenging. They just haven’t had as much experience with independence and decision making. So there’s trade offs. The slow strategy is not all good. It’s not all bad. It doesn’t mean kids are more responsible or less mature, it just means they’re taking longer to do these adult activities. But looking more at the edges, we can see some issues that if we have a shift in parenting that’s not just, OK, they’re going to take longer to grow up, but that’s in the mix — and we want to protect them from not just physical dangers, but experiences. Then, we’re starting to run into trouble. This is the observation that Jon Haidt and Lenore Skenazy have made with their organization, Let Grow, that parents who want to give their kids more experience with independence often run afoul of laws and norms that say, oh, a nine-year-old can’t walk a mile by themselves, or Lenore’s nine-year-old, she let take the subway in New York. Her kid loved it, and then she wrote about it and got all kinds of grief from people — that was dangerous, and so on. And this was a good 10, 15 years ago. So this is where you do run into trouble, when kids developing independence can be good and can be safe, but we have a parenting culture now that says you cannot let your kid out of your sight for one second. And that, I think many people have argued, and I would agree, takes things too far, and does a real disservice to children.

ezra klein

Well, there’s a weird disconnect here, between “you can’t let your kid out of your sight,” so there’s a lot less of independence out in the real world, but then this really expansive independence for fairly young kids, in the digital world, in part because it’s just harder over long periods of time to keep all the kind of parental blockers, and not let them be talking to their friends on Facebook Messenger or whatever. And so there is this distinction between the real world, which does have dangers — but I think it’s fair to say, in most of the data, they’re overstated in our culture, and the digital world, which the dangers are, if anything understated, it seems, for teens in our culture. But teens have a lot more freedom to traverse the digital world for hours and hours and hours a day with no supervision, while being out in the real world is much more heavily regulated.

jean twenge

I think that’s exactly right. And in my previous book, “iGen,” which is all about Gen Z, there’s one graph that I made which illustrates this. And again, it’s at the extremes — but that about 2011, the teen suicide rate exceeded the teen homicide rate for — it wasn’t the first time, but it was the first time it did it for years on end, where the two crossed. And that mirrors other trends that we see, that this generation is physically safer. They don’t get in car accidents as much, or fistfights as much, or drink alcohol as much. But perhaps because they are so unregulated in their time online, that’s why we have these record levels of depression and suicide and self-harm.

ezra klein

But there is something narratively weird about this. I mean, I grew up in the ‘90s and to some degree in the early aughts. And I remember the panics of that period, as I became a professional journalist in 2005. And I still remember that there was a lot of debate over teen pregnancy and abstinence only education and teen drug use. And there was a dumb panic over rainbow parties, which you can look it up if you’d like to know what those were, or what they were purported to be, at the very least. And we got all these numbers down. I mean, drug use is down, and age of sex is up, and teen pregnancy is down. And alcohol use is down, and smoking is down. And you would have thought, I think, from the discourse of the time, that that would have led to an overall improvement in teen well-being. And it seems like there’s been a very real “be careful what you wish for” here, that if you go back, I think, to the panics of the “why are the kids not all right” of 1999, a lot of that reversed. And now, the kids are in even worse shape. So what do you make of why so many things that we thought were a big problem for kids have gone down, and yet it turns out those were maybe correlates of things we actually wanted from them in the real world?

jean twenge

Yeah, and this is not at all to discount teen pregnancy and alcohol abuse and physical dangers — homicide, obviously — big problems, not that these are small —

ezra klein

Homicide is bad. Let’s put that on the table.

jean twenge

Yes. Let’s just make sure we’re being clear about this. These physical dangers are definitely bad, but they are correlates of teens getting together with each other in person. And yet, sometimes when teens get together with each other in person, trouble follows. That does happen. But the vast majority of the time when teens get together face to face, that’s good for mental health. They’re spending time together. They’re sharing about their experiences. They’re making sometimes lifelong friendships. At the very least, they’re having companionship through the journey of adolescence and high school, which is not always an easy time — usually is not an easy time. And trying to do that online is a pale shadow. It is not the same. And so yeah, we have a lot more kids that are at home not getting into these other types of teenage trouble. But that’s probably why they’re depressed, because they’re at home, in their bedrooms, on their phones, instead of being with each other in person.

ezra klein

I want to look at another theory here. So Derek Thompson had a piece in The Atlantic where he’s looking at a 2022 paper by Dirk Bethmann and Robert Rudolf that found, quote, higher standardized test scores and student assessments of academic competition were strongly correlated with teen anxiety. If you take two countries that are equivalent in almost every way, same G.D.P., inequality, life expectancy, air pollution, the nation with higher test scores and more student competition will have more anxious and depressed teens. What do you make of that?

jean twenge

Well, to really apply that principle to the stats in teen depression, we’d want to look at something that looked at academic pressure over time. And we can do that in these big surveys. So we can look at time spent on homework, for example. Did time spent on homework suddenly increase around 2012, right as teen depression started to increase, and did it keep increasing? In fact, the opposite is true. Eighth and 10th graders spend less time on homework in recent years, compared to previously. The pattern for eighth graders is particularly linear, and that’s the group where you see the biggest increases in depression and self harm. Other measures of academic pressure — so there’s a question on one of the big teen surveys, how much competition is there for grades at your school? That’s also gone down — goes up and down a little bit, it’s not as linear, but the overall pattern is teens are reporting less academic pressure in recent years. Then you could say, OK, well, let’s look at who’s doing the worst? And this is among individuals, instead of countries. So that’s one difference from that other study. So which group is most likely to be depressed? Is it the high achievers — say, those who have an A average and are planning to go straight to a four year college? Or is it those who do not have a stellar of a record and are not planning to go to a four year college? It’s the low achievers who have higher rates of depression, particularly the low achieving girls. So I think that theory falls apart pretty quickly, at least when you look at the U.S. data over time.

ezra klein

Well, let me try to steel-man at least the back half of that, because I take your point that a lot of things fall apart because they don’t explain the time series change. But they could be part of the background radiation of this, it could be good if you change them. It’s possible that what will reverse this is not exactly what caused it. So I don’t want to — I don’t want to hang literally everything on whether or not it explains 2012. And I think on the flip of that, you could imagine an explanation — and I’d be curious how you think about testing this or absorbing it — we’re in a world where there is a lot of competition, and where particularly post-2008 recession, and a much broader societal sense of economic insecurity and precarity, that yeah, if you’re a teenager who’s not doing great, that it’s actually getting scarier and scarier for you. And that to be in that position — and particularly to be in that position in a place where there’s a lot of pressure on it, right? You’re in a school that does send a lot of kids to four year colleges, to say nothing of really highly competitive ones, and you’re one of the kids not doing well, that the sense that you might just be screwed forever is going to be a lot heavier than it would have been at other times because the literal structure of the American economy is making it more likely now that if you don’t have a four year college education from a pretty good school, you’re at a much higher likelihood of being in real economic despair over time. I mean, it does feel to me when you look at the American economy overall that the sense of — of education is structuring your entire life — is reasonably going up, because it reasonably does, in fact, seem to structure a lot of your future earning potential. And so the fact that you’re not seeing the worst of the effect among the highest achieving kids would I think be natural there.

jean twenge

Yeah, and you can definitely see it that way. And there’s probably multiple confounding factors, too, that the kids who aren’t doing well could have a terrible life at home, not have any friends. That could also lead to depression. So there’s all kinds of possible things going on there. But the general idea is absolutely worth considering, and it is true. You look at median incomes of those who have a college degree, it’s considerably higher than those who don’t. I’m not as convinced, for a couple of reasons, that Gen Z teens are really feeling that, though. I saw a poll the other day. There’s been a decline in the number of young people who think a college education is completely necessary for doing well. That may be because of labor shortages out there right now. It could be because they see other potential opportunities in other types of careers. I also think it is really important to keep in mind what the reality is for college admissions, because I think there’s a really common perception that things are so impossibly competitive now. Well, you know what, that is true for the Ivy Leagues and Ivy adjacent schools. It’s a very small percentage of kids who are aiming to go to those schools. So if we’re talking about changes in averages, it’s not really a group that we’re going to want to focus on. What we’re going to want to focus on is the kids who maybe do OK in high school. Well, I can’t completely speak to other areas of the country, but where I live in California, the high school my daughter goes to — my oldest daughter — if you get a 2.5, you’re pretty much guaranteed admission to Cal State San Marcos, which is a perfectly good, even really good school to get your undergraduate degree. So if you get some mix of Bs and Cs, you can go there. And then let’s say you don’t, you can go to community college. There are opportunities. It’s not that it completely shuts off.

ezra klein

Is there any evidence of downward contagion here? So “Generations” has a lot of data on each of the different generations. And I’m curious if you’re seeing rises in — because I think there is some evidence of this — rises in anxiety and depression among Gen X-ers, among elder millennials — I’m an elder millennial, I have young kids now. I definitely think that I am part of the cultural dynamic where ideas and structures and frameworks of things like anxiety are more easily at hand. And I worry sometimes when I talk to my four-year-old that because I am practiced at recognizing something like anxiety in myself, I am, if anything, too practiced at offering it as an explanation to him, which will make it easier for him to grasp at. Is there any concern or evidence that something happening here is that the parents are in worse mental health or have more of these ideas or just have culturally been taught to be that much more responsive to kids’ feelings, and as such are beginning to create more contagion? And again, recognizing maybe that doesn’t explain the 2012 turn, but if you imagine that you could have a 2012 turn coming from smartphones and then different cultural dynamics amplifying it? If kids are getting a bit more depressed, and then parents who are more depressed are freaking out about their kid’s depression much more quickly and then embedding that idea of that story into them — like, you could see something like a feedback loop kicking off.

jean twenge

Or the alternative explanation would be if they’re more sensitive to it, they might be more likely to get their kids’ mental health treatment, and then the depression should be lower, because mental health treatment does usually work. So yeah, there is a generational story here to mental health, but it’s a little bit of a different one from what you’re telling. So when I first started looking at the data on, say — let’s just say clinical level depression, it was showing up for teens. It began to show up for young adults a couple of years after so 2013, 2014. You’re seeing it up to the age of about 25. For a while, it was not appearing among those ages 26 and over. Then it did. So after about 2015 or 2016, then you also start to see a rise in clinical level depression among 26 to 34-year-olds. It doesn’t really appear among those 35 and older, just basically not a whole lot going on in terms of rates of clinical level depression between 2005 and 2021. But there’s a pronounced increase among 26 to 34-year-olds. It doesn’t equal the increase among teens and young adults, but it’s still there, and it’s still very striking. This is in the millennial chapter of “Generations.” And this is a little bit of a mystery, because why would it be just these cohorts? Why are we seeing this primarily among those younger than 35? And in another data set, it’s more that we see it more among those 39 and younger. And why does it start to increase the most after 2015? So I go through a few explanations in the book. But when I posted some of this on Substack, I asked people for their ideas, because it’s very hard to figure out exactly what’s going on. It doesn’t look like it’s Trump’s election, because you see the same pattern in, for example, blue state of California versus the red state of Texas. And it happens right before he’s elected, not after. My pet theory was that millennials are disappointed by adulthood, given their childhood of optimism and confidence. And I think that may have some validity here. But if that were true, what you’d expect is pretty much all millennials — say, let’s take the first group born in the early ‘80s — that they would be depressed pretty much as soon as they hit 30. And that’s not really what happens. You see that much more with those born in the late ‘80s and especially the early ‘90s. So that made me think it had something more to do with what was happening in the overall culture around that time. And I think if you really look back on it, that was the time when social media and the culture at large really started to turn much more negative, and the negative news was getting more clicks, and it was spreading more. And misinformation was starting to gain hold. And it just wasn’t — I don’t know, I think if you look at, like, the kind of critical mass of pessimism in the country, the mid 2000s is where that seems to have begun. [MUSIC PLAYING]

One set of solutions you often hear have to do with individual or even parental restraint around smartphone use, so grayscale your phone, or set limits on the screen time app or utility, or no phones after 7 p.m., that kind of thing. How do you think about that set of individual — either hacks or constraints — as an answer to this?

jean twenge

I’m of two minds about this. I think on the one hand, there are things individuals can do. On the other, it’d be even better if we had more regulation, particularly around social media. So there are things that we can at least try to do, so no phones in the bedroom overnight is my favorite one. And that’s not just for teens, it’s for adults too — tons of sleep lab studies, as we talked about, that you’re not going to sleep as well if that phone is in your bedroom. People have a tendency to, when they wake up in the middle of the night, look at it, and then that whole process starts over again with poor sleep. And many people’s protest to this is, yes, but I have to have my phone in my bedroom overnight because it’s my alarm clock. I have some advice for you. Buy an alarm clock. They’re cheap. You can buy two or three if you’re worried. Then there’s other things to say, but — so I have three kids. We have tried to delay the smartphone as long as possible and to delay social media even further. And I do think that is a good idea. If the kid really needs a phone, get him a flip phone. Get him a pared down smartphone, like a Gabb phone, where you can text, talk, and take pictures, and that’s it. There’s no ability to download social media or access the internet. So there are some things that we can try. The difficulty is parental permission isn’t needed to get a social media account. And kids are supposed to be 13, but age isn’t actually verified. School laptops have YouTube on them, at least ours do. So there’s only so much that individuals can do. Social media is extremely unregulated. And I think the time has come to regulate it more so we can have more of these solutions that are at a group level. So just as one example, if we raised the minimum age for social media to 16 and required age actually being verified and enforced that, social media would be out of middle schools. That’s already a time — developmentally, that’s very difficult, and social media makes it worse. And then kids would not be able to make the argument, which so often happens, but everybody I know has Snapchat, Mom. Then they wouldn’t.

ezra klein

So Republican Senator Josh Hawley has actually called for a ban on social media use for kids under 16. He cited your research, partially, in calling for that ban. It hasn’t gotten, I think, a ton of momentum, but your view is that’s actually worth it, that this is bad enough that we should just lock it out for kids under 16.

jean twenge

Yeah, I do think that. There are safer ways, better ways for kids 15 and under to communicate with each other than social media, which is not designed for children. It’s not even designed for teens. It’s designed for adults. Plus, then there’s the whole element of, why does social media exist? It exists because it makes money. We think it’s free. It’s free in terms of money. But us and our children are paying with our time. We’re paying with our attention, and might even be paying with our mental health.

ezra klein

We’ve also seen some interesting policies now in the United States. So Utah has been, I think, particularly aggressive here. In late March, Governor Spencer Cox, he’s a Republican there, he signed two bills. So when you put them together, Utah now requires parental consent before kids can sign up for sites like TikTok and Instagram. It prohibits kids under 18 from using social media between the hours of 10:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m., requires age verification for anyone who wants to use social media in the state, tries to prevent tech companies from attracting kids to their apps using addictive features. What did you think of that? And if you’re following it, how is implementation going on that?

jean twenge

Yeah, so I think these are the types of things we need to be doing, Just common sense solutions that — no, we don’t want to eliminate social media. It certainly has some benefits, particularly for adults. But there are some steps that we can take to try to make it safer for kids and teens.

ezra klein

I was genuinely struck when we began looking at who has proposed what here — Arkansas, Texas, Ohio and Louisiana have sort of similar bills that they’re thinking about to Utah — and so, I should say for this point, does New Jersey. But it really is, I think it is fair to say at this moment, red states and Republican members of Congress who are willing to be — to use the old term, more paternalistic on this, which goes back, I think, a little bit to our conversation about parenting styles, where there’s possibly a tendency for conservative parents to be more willing to say, no, I have a rule here, and you are a kid, and you don’t get to decide. I’m sure you get a lot of incoming from politicians, from governors. I’m curious what differences in style, in kind of quantity of interest you’ve seen among Republicans and Democrats here.

jean twenge

Well, it’s interesting. At least in the Senate, it’s been pretty bipartisan. So Richard Blumenthal, say, he’s done a lot of work on this. There’s some other Democratic politicians who have done the same. For states, it’s true. It seems to have broken down that way more commonly than not. But I mean, how much do we have right now where there is bipartisan support? This is one of the few things that falls under that.

ezra klein

One thing you’re seeing in a bunch of states — California, where I’m from is one — is an approach that’s less about what I would call parental rights, or paternalism, and more about this idea of holding tech companies accountable, focusing on the collection and use of data, on privacy. How do you think about that?

jean twenge

I think it’s long overdue. We have to start thinking a lot more about this business model, where on social media, you’re the product. And your data is the product, and is that really how we want to be doing things? Plus, then there’s all the other issues of how is social media and the internet environment overall affecting politics? How is it affecting the national mood? We were discussing this pessimism which seems to be so pervasive now, which I think is fairly out of step with objective reality, and why is it so negative? It’s all of these things, that’s what gets traction on social media and online, about any kind of political discussion, regardless of any facts about positive things.

ezra klein

Are there other major policies you would want to put into place for mental health? And here, putting social media to the side, let’s say we banned it for everybody under 16, and kind of did everything else on the list that you would be interested in. What other things do you think we could do that would be good for teen mental health?

jean twenge

Well, I mean, that would be a huge step, and who knows if it’ll ever happen. But I have my hopes. I think that would make an enormous difference. You know, I think a lot of the other solutions are less straightforward. But if there are ways to combat the pervasive negativity that we’ve been discussing, I think that would make a big difference, too, because obviously, the mental health of young people is an enormous concern. But in doing further analysis for this new book, the other thing that started to really concern me was the extremely high levels of pessimism among young adults — not just about their own prospects, but about the world. It was really stunning to me. There was a poll that asked about — do you think America is a fair society or an unfair society? And the majority of young adults said unfair. And do we need to make fundamental changes to American government? Again, the majority of young adults said yes. And then there was a question, do you believe that the founders of the United States are better described as heroes or as villains? And four out of 10 Gen Z young adults said villains, and only 10 percent of boomers said villains.

ezra klein

This is a conversation I’ve had at different times with Jon Haidt. And something I sometimes hear in data like that is a way of thinking that, while harder for the individual to bear, may in some ways be better for a society. So to take the other side of that argument, I mean, American society isn’t fair. It’d be, I think, ridiculous to look at American society, with these levels of inequality, these levels of intergenerational racial dynamics, and call the society here fair. How you think of the founders, I think people can differ on that. And I probably wouldn’t call them villains. But I don’t know. I think you could say that there has been in America, like in a lot of countries, a pressure to sign on to various societal myths that make change more difficult, because if you have to agree that everything is good, then why change anything? And so maybe in the same way that trends that looked bad when I was a kid, like teen pregnancy, ended up having correlates that later on we sort of felt a little bit better about, like kids spending time together in person, I wonder if some of the pessimism that you’re talking about there doesn’t — in the more optimistic take — lead to a generation that, when it gets through the crucible of teenagerdom, is actually a little bit more open to changing or addressing pretty long entrenched inequalities that have been hard to change, you know, exactly in part because we’ve been pushed into the idea that to say something like America is not fair is to, in some way, insult America as opposed to observe something true about America.

jean twenge

First of all, that one item is probably a little less distressing than the others, the one about the fundamental changes. It depends on how you interpret that. I think this is the fork in the road. There’s arguably two ways that this could play out. So first, yes, we have a generation of young adults who want to change things. So if they do that by, relatively speaking, working within the system, we could have very positive outcomes here. And so far, there’s some signs of this. So Gen Z young adults are voting at a higher rate than millennials and Gen X-ers did at the same age. So if they are going to the voting booth and trying to change things to make it more fair, that can be a very positive outcome. Because yeah, if you see things as negative, then you take the steps to get things changed. Where I think a lot of people have more concern is if this ends up being more nihilism, just almost negativity for negativity’s sake, and there’s nothing we can do. And there’s some signs of that too, so — say, one of the big surveys of high school seniors has an item, ‘Every time I try to get ahead, something or somebody stops me.’ So that’s even more about individuals rather than politics. But the percentage who agree with that have gone up. So that’s an external locus of control. So whether you’re talking about individual prospects or politics, having that kind of defeatist attitude doesn’t tend to bode well. It is linked to all kinds of bad outcomes — poor performance at work and school being one example. And you can see that in the political arena, too. Everybody just throws up their hands, says, oh, nothing we can really do. It’s just the way it is. Things are just terrible and they’re getting worse. That may not be good.

ezra klein

But one thing I noticed there that I think is interesting, and I wonder if it points towards any other policies, is that when we started talking about social media, we talked a lot about time displacement more than negativity, right, that people aren’t seeing friends as much in person. Their social connections are weakening. They’re not sleeping as much. Sort of here at the end, we’re talking more about the stew of negativity. And I agree on the stew of negativity. I think it’s bad. But I’m curious on those other things. I mean, if we think those are powerful, it does feel to me like maybe there is more we can do on them. I don’t exactly know what it would be like, what a national program to help people sleep better would actually look like. But I wonder if you’re beginning to see this creep up the age scale if it doesn’t have some of the same effects. I mean, we’ve covered loneliness among adults on other episodes of the show. And that seems to be pretty bad. I mean, is that where you would begin to look?

jean twenge

Yes, depression is starting to creep up the age scale. So one thing I did in the book is look at time spent in person in a survey of adults, because I started looking at this in teens. And there has been a decline in in-person socializing among millennials, so in this case, looked at 27 to 41-year-olds. And there’s a little bit of a decline among those over the age of 50, for example, but not as much. So older generations, even though they also use social media, seem to have not cut back as much on their in-person socializing as young adults and teens have. So that might be one of the reasons why we’re not seeing as many increases in mental health issues among those ages 40 and over, or 50 and over, depending on the measure. But as an overall issue, yes, you know, loneliness is huge. So the surgeon general recently released a report on loneliness, with a number of solutions. And I think that would be a place to go, to start thinking about this. But it’s very difficult, because there’s not a whole lot of low hanging fruit, I think, in this area, in the way that there is around social media and teens. It’s a lot harder to solve loneliness in the society overall.

ezra klein

I think that’s a good place to end. So always our final question, what are three books that have influenced you, that you’d recommend to the audience?

jean twenge

All right, so my first two get to some of the issues that we’ve been talking about. They both have “problem” in their title. The first is “The Problem With Everything” by Meghan Daum, so I quote that a lot in “Generations.” She’s a Gen X-er like myself, and her observations about the changes in culture, particularly online culture, starting in the mid 2010s was very insightful and helped me codify some things that I had been noticing, in terms of the split between Gen X-ers and millennials. Particularly, the Gen X-ers pride themselves on being tough and resilient, and that is not as prized by later generations. Then, the second is called “What’s Our Problem” by Tim Urban. This is one of the best nonfiction books I have read in a very long time. It has a really amazing structure for understanding some of the polarization and division that we are really observing right now in American politics and culture. So — it has the really interesting rubric that’s not just right and left in politics, that there’s upper, in terms of talking about ideas, and lower, in terms of just kind of beating people over the head. That was a very fascinating way to think about the structure of American politics. And it goes much broader than that, into all the issues. So the third is for fun. It’s a fiction book called “Nine Ladies,” and it is “Pride and Prejudice” meets “Outlander.” And great plot and great consideration of what would happen if a 1987 born Elizabeth Bennet ended up in Mr. Darcy’s time, and then the author takes it from there.

ezra klein

Jean Twenge, your new book is called “Generations.” Thank you very much.

The film speaks the same cinematic language, employing an ethereal, emotive color palette that enlivens every splash of water and blade of grass.

You can spot Miyazaki’s influence in more than just the visuals. There are familiar symbols and themes: The portal doors, the cursed male hero and a few narrative moves in the resolution all scream Miyazaki’s “Howl’s Moving Castle,” while the exploration of memory and grief mirrors his “Spirited Away.”

I’ll stop the Miyazaki comparisons there because Shinkai showcases plenty of his own narrative and directorial signatures in “Suzume.” He’s created a thoroughly modern world of both old and new forms of magic, of spells and old gods and of Instagram posts and texts. Like a locomotive chugging uphill, the story’s stakes are quickly raised to the scale of natural disasters and mythical phenomena, while Shinkai puts an emphasis on specific towns and regions in Japan, grounding us in the real world even as he whisks us away to other worlds.

What’s particularly exciting in “Suzume” is the story’s start. Seventeen-year-old Suzume wakes up from an otherworldly dream and heads off to school. On the way, she encounters and tries to follow a mysterious stranger named Souta but ends up in the ruins of an old resort, where she stumbles upon a free-standing door floating in a shallow bank of water.

Diplomats from the U.S., Egypt and other Middle Eastern countries were locked in frantic talks yesterday to ease the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Clashes along Israel’s border with Lebanon and Israeli airstrikes inside Syria stoked fears of a wider conflict in the region.

Israel’s new emergency wartime government held its first formal meeting amid a total breakdown of trust between the citizens and the state, which appeared to be preparing for the invasion. “We will take Hamas apart,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, according to a statement.

Yesterday, Israel’s military offered residents of Gaza a three-hour midday window to leave via a main highway, but Gaza’s Health Ministry refused to evacuate hospitals.

“There is nowhere in Gaza that can accept the number of patients in our intensive care unit or neonatal intensive care unit or even the operating rooms,” said Dr. Muhammad Abu Salima, the director of Al Shifa Hospital, Gaza’s largest medical complex."

Young musicians, young artists, that is not the best way to develop a sense of self. Develop a sense of self by the work you do, by building your own confidence, by listening to your own voice.

From New York Times Opinion, this is “The Ezra Klein Show.” [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, it is Ezra. I am on book leave, but this week, taking a turn at the mic is David Wallace-Wells. He is a Times Opinion writer. He’s the author of “The Uninhabitable Earth: Life after Warming.” And I just think that over the past couple of years, not just his work on climate change and biodiversity loss, but also his work particularly on Covid has been absolutely fantastic. So I asked him to come on and do a couple shows around these themes. I. Hope you enjoy. [MUSIC PLAYING]

david wallace-wells

This summer, the U.S. reached an important pandemic milestone. According to multiple measures, the number of Americans dying today looks pretty close to what it looked like just before the pandemic hit. As my colleague David Leonhardt noted in July, you can make a pretty good case that this data shows the pandemic is finally, mercifully over. But over the last several months, I’ve started to worry that even as we put Covid-19 somewhat in the rear view mirror, we’re still not seeing the experience of the pandemic very clearly in hindsight. Officially, more than a million Americans have died of Covid. But somehow, that unbelievable fact isn’t really the center of our story about the last three years. We’re not properly mourning or grieving a million deaths. Instead, we’re arguing about school closures, and mask mandates, and the wisdom of the enormous economic stimulus. It doesn’t feel like we’ve all just lived through a world historical trauma. It feels like we’re putting the pandemic to the same trivial, often partisan, purposes we put everything else. In the spring, as congressional hearings led by Republicans on the early days of the pandemic got underway, the epidemiologist Katelyn Jetelina wrote an essay on what she called this “revisionist phase” of the pandemic. I think that idea, revisionist history, offers perhaps the clearest description of the country’s strange relationship to the pandemic right now. And so as the country moves on from the Covid emergency, I wanted to invite her on the show to talk about that revisionism in all its forms. As always, you can email the show with your thoughts and guest recommendations at ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. [MUSIC PLAYING] Katelyn Jetelina, welcome to the podcast.

katelyn jetelina

Yeah, thanks for having me.

david wallace-wells

So I wanted to start by asking, how do you think we ended up here? More than 1.1 million officially dead, and seeming to argue less about how we could have saved more of those lives than about things like, whether the F.D.A. rushed to approve booster shots for the young. How did that happen?

katelyn jetelina

I don’t know if we’ve had a lot of time to really process what happened in the past three and a half years. As an epidemiologist, we’ve just been going 2000 mph just trying not to crash into a guardrail. And I think we’re finally at that stage where we can look back and process and reflect and define what those lessons were learned, and how we can do better and be smarter in the future. Back in March, I claimed that we were entering this new phase of the pandemic called “revisionism.” And I think there’s an attempt to revise 2020 really under the comfort of 2023 vaccines and treatment and immunity. And I think there’s a couple of reasons for that. One, there’s bad actors. There’s also really a lack of nuanced discussion around trade offs today, but also it’s just a normal human response. You brought up the 1918 flu pandemic. But how we remember and make decisions is largely driven by our experiences. And it makes it easier to remember certain things while forgetting others. And there’s many biases contributing to this. So I think we’re in a really tough spot. The past three and a half years were really tough for the United States, particularly because we thought we were prepared, and we were not. And it really tested our morals, our values, our psychology, and our culture in the States as well.

david wallace-wells

You wrote recently that humans don’t like being reminded of their vulnerability as it brings out a lot of hate and anger. And I’ve had a sort of a similar intuition for a while that we’ve argued about our response to the pandemic, sort of pointing our fingers at one another, in part, as a way of telling ourselves that it didn’t have to be so hard or so brutal or full of quite so much death. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the way that we’ve been sort of projecting our frustrations or despair onto one another, the way that we are engaging in revisionism rather than reflection at the moment, and how that’s messing up our picture of what we actually live through.

katelyn jetelina

Yeah, I think the natural human response is that we’ve all been through hell the past three and a half years. And what that looked like was very different for different groups of people. And we all want someone to blame, honestly. And it’s hard to blame a microscopic virus, right? It’s easier to blame other humans for mistakes or things that we didn’t agree with. And I have been particularly reflecting in the space of just how much hate I’ve received the past three and a half years by being on the forefront in public facing of this pandemic, death threats, microaggressions, doxxing, pretty terrible things. And the one thing I can reconcile with is that when people don’t like being afraid, people don’t like not having answers. And once we get through and we say, woo, that was over. We survived that sucked, but now things are good, we’re wanting to resolve that inconsistency. And many people discount how bad things were then instead of focusing how good they are now.

david wallace-wells

Tell me how you see that point in particular. Like, how bad were things in 2020?

katelyn jetelina

It was bad. Early in 2020, it was horrible because — I mean, I just remember seeing body bags and refrigerated trucks. I distinctly remember that Red Cross ship passing by the Statue of Liberty. I think that was in March of 2020. And those were all very scary things. I think the other really scary thing as scientists that were trying to determine policies and walk 330 million people through this experience was how little we knew as well. It’s easy to forget how many questions we had in the beginning. And as we got questions answered as time went on, it was even more challenging to bring the public along for the scientific discovery ride. And I think early, Fauci said 70,000 Americans. If anyone said in March of 2020, 1.2 million Americans, you would have been laughed at.

david wallace-wells

You know, I work for The New York Times, we sort of famously put a banner headline across the front page, 100,000 Americans died and listed them. And that was an effort at some kind of public grieving, public mourning, but we basically never indulged that impulse again. I mean, we’re at 11 times as many deaths, and most of those milestones, 200,000, 300,000, 800,000, even a million, most of those passed with much less fanfare even though the death totals are much larger. When I hear you talking about the sort of grim memories of 2020 in particular — the Red Cross boat, the body bags. I also think about the temporary morgues that were set up outside of hospitals. And I also remember a time of great panic and tangled up in that panic was already, even from the start, a lot of partisanship and polarization. And one of the things I heard from quite a lot of people on the left was if we had had someone else in charge, we would not be dealing with this. That something like a zero Covid outcome would have been possible with a different president. But when I look at the comparison set across our peer countries, the U.S. did do worse than most of the countries it thinks of as its peers, both in the first year of the pandemic and overall. But especially in that first year, the gap between how poorly we did and how poorly everyone else did seems relatively small, all things considered. And I want to talk about the partisan dynamics and dimensions to that in a bit. But I wanted to ask you first, just given how almost uniform the brutality of the disease ended up being across the rich countries of the world — where you have, say, Europe as a whole, I think, on a per-capita basis — they had about 80 or 85 percent as much death as the U.S. did. How much of what we lived through, how much of that 1.1 million deaths, how much of that pandemic brutality, overall, was avoidable in your view? And how much of it was in a way that we may be quite uncomfortable acknowledging the inevitable result of just this disease infecting and growing through this population on this planet, in this year at this time with our politics?

katelyn jetelina

Yeah, so you’re right. The United States is one of the leaders in excess deaths during this pandemic. And it’s only natural to compare to other countries, and even comparing across states. I think politics had a lot to do with it. But there was also really decisive politics in other countries, and they didn’t do as bad. And so I actually think one of the main reasons was because of our underfunded, fragmented public health system in the United States — that this Covid-19 was just a different beast. And coordination across all local and states was close to impossible. Talking about data infrastructure is one of them. Another one is communication. I still think we’re doing a terrible job in communicating to the public on a national, and even sometimes local level on what’s going on, bringing them again along for the scientific discovery ride. So there’s that public health system that’s underfunded, that a lot of countries actually fixed from past epidemics. For example, I always look at Vietnam. They didn’t do a great job with SARS in 2003. But after that, they created a new public health system from the lessons they learned, and that really paid off for them. The other thing that we can’t ignore in the United States is that we just didn’t have a lot of wiggle room to mess up. We hit hospital capacity in a bad flu year, not even given a pandemic. We also have very little safety nets for populations, like health insurance, sick paid leave, which a lot of other countries do have, like the U.K. or Sweden or Denmark. And so yes, I think politics fueled a lot of decisiveness, but I also think much deeper underlying factors also played a very big part.

david wallace-wells

And in thinking about those challenges and those deeper underlying factors, in theory, we could be responding and walking out of this pandemic and committing ourselves to a real rededicated effort to build out our public health authority, build out our public health infrastructure. But as you noted earlier when you mentioned that phrase, “pandemic revisionism,” we’re doing a little bit of that. We’re trying to take measures now that might help us in future pandemics. But at a sort of a cultural level, at a level of discourse, and political debate, we seem to be doing almost as much forgetting as we are returning and reforming. And I wonder if you could just tell us a little bit about what, in particular, you meant when talking about pandemic revisionism? What did you have in mind when you wrote that piece?

katelyn jetelina

I think the bottom line is that revisionism is something that us, humans, are designed to do — that we, again, remember and make decisions largely based in driven on our experiences. And part of that is psychological resilience and some of that is biological, right, to wade through all of the information and all of the experiences we went through the past three and a half years. We have to use shortcuts. And our human brain isn’t like a computer. It’s not just like data in or data out. The way we think about things is not purely logical. Biases have a large effect on memories. So it is part of this cognitive dissonance that early 2020 was horrible, but things are much better now. And we can reconsider this big, past event. And it can feel off putting our inconsistent, but we want to resolve that inconsistency. So many people discount how bad things were. And one thing that I think really help with revisionism is having a serious conversation about the Covid-19 pandemic and how to prepare for the future. Like you said, we seem to be entering this cycle of panic and neglect. And this cycle is not new for public health. We go through this cycle of panic and neglect every single emergency in the United States. And it is quite exhausting. And we need to figure out a way to get out of that revolving door so we are better prepared for the future.

david wallace-wells

It seems to me that there’s a sort of a growing consensus everywhere you look — not just on the right — that, as a whole, we went a little too far. And I’m curious how you tell that story, but the data points that spring to my mind are something like three dozen states have passed laws restricting the future use of public health authority, polls show declining faith in public health and in vaccines, many Americans feel quite sure that schools stayed close too long, and if they ever should have closed in the first place. We can talk about schools in a little bit more detail later, but when The Times conducted a survey of epidemiologists and public health figures a few months ago about how we might respond to a future pandemic, the prompt they gave was that they were facing a novel disease that was more infectious, more deadly, and didn’t have the same age skew as Covid, which means that young people were just as likely to die from this imagined new disease as the old one. And yet, almost every expert weighing in on every policy question put to them advised that in response to that new disease, we should do a little bit less and respond with a lighter touch than we had with Covid. How do you think about this national move? It’s not all the way to let it rip. But if we were living in a way that was animated by a lot of fear in 2020, it seems to me like we’re living now or thinking about Covid now in ways that have much more to do with some mix of excess confidence or fatalism. And I know those sound contradictory at a policy level. They kind of end up in the same place. How do you think about why we’re there, and where that’s pulling us now?

katelyn jetelina

I think there are several reasons. The one big lesson that I learned that we were never taught in school, for example, was that policy isn’t just determined by epidemiology or science. It’s dependent on psychology, culture, resources, competing demands, morals. I was an epidemiologist helping lead the response in Texas. And I will forever be grateful for that because the one thing it taught me was to listen. Like, really listen. Not just hear, but listen to the competing demands, the risks and the benefits, putting the public back in public health.

david wallace-wells

So what would that look like? I mean, I recently went back and looked at the pandemic policies, particularly in the pre-vaccine period, so basically, across 2020, and I was really surprised to see how much — at the state level at least — how much unanimity there was in terms of what are often called lockdowns, school closures, business restrictions, social gathering restrictions. There was a lot of difference at the level of rhetoric from leaders, but when it came to the actual measures that were put into place for most of that spring and summer, and even by some measures into the fall, we were moving somewhat in unison. Did you feel at the time in Texas that there was a real groundswell of opposition, and they were — resistance was growing and could be alleviated if concerns were listened to? And how could we do better in listening to the people who might have felt boxed out of those conversations?

katelyn jetelina

I absolutely saw what you were saying. The spring summer of 2020, I felt like everyone was on the same page, whether it was Republican state or Democrat state or rural or urban. And then the school debate started in late summer of 2020. And I think that this is where we started seeing a difference in values and a difference in priorities depending on where you stood and where you were. And so I think that really started fueling this. Of course, you then also had the never maskers becoming more and more loud in fall of 2020. And then once vaccines hit, you have disinformation sowing a lot of doubt, but also people were starting to get protected. And what that meant, the risk calculus started changing over time. And I think because of that on an individual level, values became louder and louder. And how do we do it better in the future other than truly having an ear to the ground and communicating and framing things that, “it’s not us against each other, it’s us against a virus,” “it’s not the economy against public health, it’s them together” is a billion-dollar question. And I am not convinced that we will do better next time with this because, again, we just haven’t had a really serious conversation about the risks and benefits.

david wallace-wells

Yeah, I mean, this whole subject raises to me what’s a kind of huge looming question, which is how well did our mitigation measures actually work? How do we know how well we did in the pre-vaccine phase? What do we know about what impact things like school closures and masking and social distancing had on the spread of the disease? There was a big paper that came out a couple weeks ago, I think, showing that overall, in the aftermath of vaccinations, Republican voters were 43 more likely to die, I think, than Democratic voters, which is a mind boggling effect. But almost as striking to me was that in that phase before vaccination, there was no difference at all, and that matches some other studies that have been done. And I wonder, thinking both in a state-by-state comparison way, a community-to-community comparison way, thinking about the international level, how do you think about this whole suite of things we did in 2020 to stop the spread of the virus? And how should we think about to what degree we might want to think about implementing them or revising our policies? Should we be faced with a similar set of dilemmas or decisions sometime again soon?

katelyn jetelina

I think this is why I’m having a challenging time answering your previous question is because we do not know how mitigation measures compare to vaccinations, for example, in terms of mortality. So we know vaccination saved more than 3 million people in the United States. That’s a pretty easy analysis that the Commonwealth Fund just put out a few months ago. But beyond that, we still do not know what works best to slow the spread of Covid-19 in terms of non-pharmaceutical interventions. For example, test and trace, or isolation, or quarantine, or indoor mask mandates, or closing venues. And this is very surprising to me because that means we still can’t answer important questions like you’re asking, like, their effectiveness or even more importantly, the trade offs. We can see in the scientific literature that prolonged shelter in places are linked to, for example, harmful alcohol use. But how does that compare to uncontrolled viral transmission? We don’t know, and these analyses are incredibly complicated to do accurately, but I think they’re equally important because we need these answers to be armed with better knowledge to do better next time. And unfortunately, these difficult questions don’t win a lot of political points, and I think, one of the reasons why we’re not finding answers right now. [MUSIC PLAYING]

david wallace-wells

Can I ask you just in particular like, what you think about, for instance, the effect of school closures on spread or the effect of masking on spread? I mean, do you think that we can talk about that in meaningful detail, or do you think it’s still a kind of a black box that simply requires more study and more scrutiny?

katelyn jetelina

Well, we can tackle masking first. Everyone wants a one word answer to this question is, do masks work? But there’s a whole lot more nuance. These three words strung together begs several loaded questions. What does work mean? What kind of mask? During what period of transmission? What disease? What social context? So it’s a really complicated question. So when I think about masks, I really divide it into three buckets. One is, can masks physically stop droplets and aerosols coming in or out? This is a physics question. And the answer is yes. We’ve seen many lab studies with SARS-CoV-2 that show that the number of particles inhaled by someone is stopped by masks, and the number of particles emitted by a person in a lab is stopped by masks. The better the mask, for example, filter and fit, the better the stop of transmission. So we have that physics lab. That’s obvious. The second question is, do masks work on an individual level? So if masks work in the lab, they must prevent infections among individuals in the real world. But that’s not necessarily correct because tightly controlled environments are very different than the real world. And we’ve seen that some people don’t wear them correctly; they wear them at different frequencies. And then the third bucket is — and I think this is where you’re getting at with the huge policy question is, if masks work in a lab and sometimes on individuals, then if hundreds and thousands of people wear them perfectly and imperfectly at one time, do they reduce transmission during a pandemic? And this is a question we do not have a good answer to. Theoretically, masks will reduce the risk of transmission if they do so on an individual level. Because when a community masks, those small effects compound exponentially across the population, which would make a dent in cases. But how much masks reduced transmission in a population is not an answer we have. There’s been very few studies that have looked at this. And among the few studies, there’s a huge range, around 9 to 45 percent reduction in transmission with community masking. And this range means that these studies were done in different settings and different cultures. So many unanswered questions remain. So if you say, do masks work? I guess my answer would be yes, but how much they work during a pandemic is — and what that again, that trade off is, with social, moral, cultural factors during an emergency is something we need to understand a whole lot more.

david wallace-wells

Well, I was struck over the past couple of years by just how much backlash it also produced. I mean, my view throughout was that even if masks only reduced disease transmission by 10 %, which is an effect that’s meaningful but on the margin, I still think what’s the cost to me of putting on a mask when I go in a grocery store? What’s the cost to me of putting on a mask when I get on the subway? It just doesn’t feel like such a large imposition, even over a pretty extended period of time, even if it has some amount of real benefit to the broader population. And it just feels like that was not the way that many Americans thought about masks. In fact, I often hear people talking about the experience of the pandemic like they describe any period of time in which they were even encouraged to wear a mask as though it was like the equivalent of lockdown. And I view it as much more a tool to allow us to continue to operate somewhat normally with a few additional protections to protect the people around us. But the backlash just seems to me, at least, huge compared to the imposition. But maybe more importantly, we just don’t have a very good idea of how to balance that risk of backlash against the ultimate benefit. And maybe you could say the backlash was worth it if it reduced cases by 50 percent. But if you’re just at 10 percent and you’re introducing a policy or policy guidance that ends up eroding trust in public health authorities, and ultimately maybe diminishing vaccine uptake down the road, it seems like a trickier question to answer in any definitive way.

katelyn jetelina

Oh, it’s a super tricky question. I think what it comes down to is that masks were used as a symbol of tribalism. And so masks were politicized. So whether you wore a mask or you did not wear a mask showed exactly what tribe you were in. And that was a very dangerous thing to play with, making public health measures our tools, which we have very little of on a population level, a symbol of bipartisanship was dangerous. And I think it’s going to hurt us during the next pandemic and even during our respiratory flu seasons as well, because it does help on an individual level. And I wish it wasn’t made into that symbol.

david wallace-wells

Well, another thing that was polarized almost from the start, but certainly in the more recent years, was the kind of counterexample of Sweden. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how you saw that country’s approach, maybe how you understood it at the outset, and how, if your thinking has evolved about what they achieved and didn’t achieve, how it has evolved over time?

katelyn jetelina

It’s really challenging to compare across states, let alone countries because what works in one country doesn’t work in another, and vice versa. And I think we can learn lessons from each other, and we should, but they also must be adopted in our context. Like I said earlier, just letting a virus run rampant like Sweden did in the beginning in an immune naïve population was just not an option as Americans had.

david wallace-wells

Yeah, I mean, I think some measures of excess mortality had 10 times as many Swedes dying in the first year of the pandemic as Norwegians. So there are complications all around. I didn’t mean to suggest that Sweden was a model of an ideal approach when I’ve written about them recently. I’ve said, what’s striking is how average their pandemic outcomes were ultimately, but also in terms of what they actually did at the time. We talk about them as an example of everybody go their own way, kind of almost let it rip approach to the disease. But there was a lot of guidance offered, a lot of schools did in fact, close for a period of time, a lot of people did shelter in place for a period of time. It was just built in a somewhat less heavy-handed way. Although as I said earlier, I think we also, to some degree, overstate how heavy-handed the American policy response was. These lockdowns, what we call lockdowns lasted five weeks in the average Republican state, seven weeks in the average Democratic State. This is in a pandemic that lasted three years. But we have this memory of this unbelievably, extended, ongoing and brutal lockdown, which wasn’t really the way most Americans navigated the pandemic. And then we compare it and contrast it with countries like Sweden that we say had a much more hands-off approach. But in fact, at a practical level, people were behaving in the way that they were going to behave, responding to the threats of the pandemic in the way that they were going to respond to them. And the differences between the countries was not nearly as great as a lot of the political rhetoric tends to suggest.

katelyn jetelina

I completely agree with you. And I would consider the United States middle of the road too. I mean, if you look at the other end of New Zealand and Australia or even China with their very, very long policies, the landscape in which these unfold is really important. And like you said, we have to be very careful with revisionism, and what happened, and what we feel like happened. I will also say that Sweden didn’t also have a perfect response. Compared to the United States, they had less excess deaths, but compared to their neighbors, like Denmark, they did a much more terrible job if we judge their job on excess deaths. And even if they didn’t have policies, there was still individual level behavior changes because people just wanted to protect themselves as well in Sweden. So I will say it’s very difficult to compare against Sweden for a reasons I said earlier, just because we have different safety nets. We don’t have health insurance, and paid sick leave, and good hospital capacity like other countries do.

david wallace-wells

So let’s talk about in some more focus the partisan dynamics that we’ve been touching on throughout, but just to take them slightly more front and center. You know, Donald Trump was, for a lot of liberal Americans at least, the kind of gravitational center of Covid policy in 2020. And we almost wanted to believe that he was singularly responsible for the pandemic as a whole. And at the time, my thoughts sort of ran along those lines as well. I was frustrated over and over again, disappointed in his sort of indifference. But when I look at the pandemic overall, I see the U.S. performing, as I said earlier, a bit less well than its peers in 2020 and then a lot less well than its peers in 2021. And that second story has a lot more to do with vaccination and vaccination uptake than it does presumably with non-pharmaceutical interventions. But of course, Donald Trump plays an interesting and complicated role on vaccination too since he’s both one of the authors of the Operation Warp Speed, in some ways responsible for the rapid development and rollout of those vaccines, and also as someone who is a kind of inveterate down player of the risks of the pandemic, presumably someone who also dampened enthusiasm, at least among his supporters, for vaccination uptake when the vaccines eventually became available mostly under Joe Biden. So how do you think about Donald Trump in thinking about the longer story of the pandemic?

katelyn jetelina

So Operation Warp speed was a huge success there. There’s no question about that. And I was really happy about how that played out. So I want to say that positive. I think the one thing I was incredibly frustrated with particularly in the beginning of setting the stage of what SARS-CoV-2 is, introducing this threat to Americans, was just the lack of communication. And when I have started digging into why this was the case, why were we so reactive rather than proactive in framing this issue and warning Americans and again, framing it, it’s us against the virus, instead of us against each, a lot of other countries did that. I keep seeing how it comes down to putting a muzzle on the C.D.C., political interference with public health officials. And so that lack of communication went for months and months. For example, Covid-19 data, we didn’t even have data coming out of the C.D.C. Johns Hopkins had to step up and volunteer efforts, had to step up to actually understand what was going on. And putting a muzzle on public health officials and the experts in this context did irreparable damage, and a reason, I think, that a lot of trust was lost.

david wallace-wells

And you see opening up in really with the vaccine rollout these huge partisan divides, which again, were not so present in much of the policy response before then. But I think there’s also a way of looking at that vaccine rollout as a kind of a success story. And there’s a dark side too. There’s a downside. There’s a way in which we failed. But early on in the vaccine rollout, there was a lot of talk about the polio vaccine and how much outreach and energy was put behind getting that into kids arms in the ‘50s. But I went back and looked recently, and the Jonas Salk polio vaccine was introduced in 1955 and targeted toward the young. And by 1961, so five or six years later, it had only reached about half of Americans under the age of 60. And with these vaccines, within two years, we got to 80 percent of adults and 95 percent or even 99 percent of vulnerable seniors. So of course, the context is different. The pandemic, in this case, was raging in a much more profound way than polio had been 70 years ago. But I also think it’s striking that we got such a large percentage of the country to take vaccines against a disease they hadn’t heard of a year or two before the shots themselves had been developed over the course of just a few months. And it wasn’t perfect. We did less well than most of our peers in Europe, and we suffered a lot in 2021 as a result. But just as a kind of a baseline, where are we in public health history kind of a data point? It feels to me that not only do we sometimes underappreciate or under celebrate Operation Warp Speed, but we also don’t quite appreciate how significant it is that we got four out of five adults to take a vaccine. We got 19 out of 20 or more seniors to take a vaccine. Does that match how you see the rollout, or should I be taking a more sort of darker view of how much worse we did than our peers?

katelyn jetelina

No, I keep going back to those stats too, that 91 percent of Americans over 12 years old have one dose in their arm. That is an incredible feat. And that took a ton of on the ground work, engaging with stakeholders, answering questions. I think we could have done it quicker, and I think we could have gotten the full vaccine series to a whole lot more people. But I do think that is a huge success that is underplayed. And I wish that we would look at the successes as much as our failures.

david wallace-wells

Even with that rollout, we have this remarkable phenomenon in the U.S., which tells the story of the gap between our vaccination coverage and the coverage in other countries where we had this significant uptake, the overwhelming majority of the most vulnerable people getting shots pretty quickly. And yet because it happened at a time when we were seeing these new variants that also spread more rapidly, the ultimate impact on our national death tolls was not all that significant — you know, 2021 was a deadlier year than 2020 was. And I wonder if we made some mistakes there in communication. If we were so focused on talking about the risk to individuals given an infection and not enough about the risk of infection and the way that those two things combined, that we sometimes gave — especially people who are vaccinated, a little bit too much of a sense of their own invulnerability because at the national level. We got everybody vaccinated. Individuals were protected quite significantly, but not all the way to a 100 percent when you have the disease spreading five times as fast in a population that has one fifth the mortality risk that they had before, the net effect is kind of equal. Do you think that we could have done a better job of continuing to advise especially the vulnerable elderly, the vulnerable vaccinated elderly in the aftermath of mass vaccination?

katelyn jetelina

Absolutely. Again, one of the biggest lessons I learned was how important scientific communication is, and that includes discussion of uncertainty and a discussion of how our knowledge evolves. One key example that I just can’t get out of my head is telling people that once they’re vaccinated, they could take off their masks. And that was such a big mistake because we didn’t also communicate what we didn’t know, which was we didn’t know how this virus was going to continue to mutate. We didn’t know how well our vaccines would keep up. So just getting that one dose is just not enough. Just not wearing a mask or not thinking about ventilation or not testing, just having a vaccine strategy is going to let the virus leak through for a certain amount of population. And when you’re talking about 330 million Americans, that’s going to be a big chunk. And so yeah I, think that our proactive scientific communication around this was a big mistake. And we also can’t discount that, that was also happening at a time where with a very different information ecosystem, with a disinformation and anti-science rhetoric really getting pushed out, at the same time, sowing doubt. And we didn’t recognize that a top down approach is no longer adaptable to today’s times, that information is no longer dictated by authorities, but it’s networked by peers. And we need to adapt to that sort of system in public health.

david wallace-wells

Yeah, I mean, on the communication point, I guess, given what were saying earlier about masks, it doesn’t seem to me to be so foolish to say, you might feel a bit more comfortable taking off your mask once you’ve been vaccinated. The thing that’s really striking to me is how little communication around the age skew of these effects really was so that someone who is 80 didn’t understand what a different landscape they were facing than someone who was 60, than someone who was 40. And we heard a lot about how the old were more vulnerable. But I think even the people for whom that information was most relevant, which is to say the very elderly, weren’t given enough context for just how large that skew really was, where someone who is in their 80s might be 1,000 times more vulnerable to infection than someone who’s say, a teenager, and may even be a few times more vulnerable than someone who’s just 5 or 10 years younger. And that goes especially for the post-vaccination era in which someone who’s 80 reduced their risk significantly but was still the equivalent of someone who was unvaccinated and say, 60. And the guidance that we gave someone who was unvaccinated and 60 before the vaccinations was not, do whatever you want, go about your life, as though everything’s normal. It was, let’s take a lot of precautions. Now, someone who is 20 and vaccinated, the logic looks a lot different. You could probably feel comfortable saying, OK, mostly this risk has been reduced quite close to zero, and you should think about your life in quite different terms.

katelyn jetelina

You’re completely right that communicating risk accurately and without bias is absolutely crucial. And this is because contextualizing really small numbers and really large numbers is close to impossible for human brains. And that lack of risk communication is because it was multidimensional and very complicated to quantify and even more difficult to communicate. And I think this is especially true with infectious diseases because risk changes with time and varies across different people. And one thing we didn’t do well in public health was try and communicate this risk, particularly because this was a novel threat. A lot of humans, even today, don’t know where to place this in the repertoire of things trying to kill us. And so getting better at data-driven guides of personal risk would be incredibly helpful moving forward. [MUSIC PLAYING]

david wallace-wells

You know, Joe Biden comes into office in January, 2021. And since that point, something like 2/3 of all the Covid deaths that we’ve had in this country have taken place. This is a period of time in which he also had the tool of vaccines that Donald Trump didn’t have. He campaigned for the presidency, in part, by saying someone who presided over 200,000 American deaths should not continue to hold that office, and yet he’s been in office for 700,000 American deaths. The first year was presided over by a Covid-minimizing president. The second and third years in theory, at least, presided over by a president who purported to take the threat seriously and wanted to get a handle on it and put science back in the White House, and yet we ended up with this quite grim ugly outcome of the last two years. In fact, the U.S. experience of those 2021, in particular, was worse than its peers by a much larger margin than had been the case in 2020. And this is, to me, a kind of a sad, distressing, and somewhat disorienting story about the pandemic, which is to say, we remember a lot of that initial panic. We’re still fighting about it. We’re still arguing about it. We also remember it. And we’ve just done a much less job of marking time and marking the tragedy of the last two years, where we’ve taken our eye off of the actual toll of the disease and let it unfold in a much less center stage kind of way. And I wonder why you think that happened or how you think about that phenomenon?

katelyn jetelina

I think it happened because of four reasons. One is the pandemic fatigue. We just are sick of it, and we start normalizing it. Second, it shows also the failure of approaching an infectious disease in an individualistic way, that we essentially ignored in the United States that infectious disease violates the assumption of independence, that what your neighbor does around you in a bus or at work or at school directly impacts you. And this is very different than, for example, diabetes or cancer where if you get diabetes, the person next to you won’t necessarily get diabetes. And this individual level risk management perspective or framing that we went into in the United States in year two and year three is against everything that public health is. That public health doesn’t treat individuals. We treat populations. And losing that narrative thread was a disservice to Americans. I think also the third thing that really impacted our normalization of deaths was the integration of politics into public health. I know a lot of people in public health were quite excited when Biden took office, because we thought it was going to be a very different type of approach, but it ended up being pretty darn similar to the administration before. And I think that also hurt Americans as well. So I think it’s complicated. I think it is incredibly tragic. And it’s hard to visualize 1.1 million Americans dead. Like you said, I saved that New York Times front page article of 100,000. But how do you communicate 10 times that is very challenging to do, and we need to do that in order to show the true toll.

david wallace-wells

I would just add one point to the political item on your list, which I think is really a good one. And that is in 2020, liberals, because they were so outraged at Donald Trump’s handling of the disease, were also therefore, kind of keeping a close score. They were pointing to the deaths and being outraged about it. And while Republicans were minimizing or dismissing a lot of the impact, at least half the country was still focused on this as a grim, horrifying tragedy and an outrage. And that meant that the death totals just had a sort of a political and cultural currency. And when the control of the White House switched over, it just seemed like a lot of the partisan imperatives were not aligned for anyone to keep such a close track of the score. And as a result, we sort of looked past a lot of what was going on. And in fact, looked past a lot of, for instance, that pretty soon the majority of deaths were among the vaccinated and started modulating or calibrating our sense of the state of play much more by the resuming normalcy of our own lives than by the mortality statistics, however large they may be. I wanted to ask now just what you cited earlier as the sort of — I don’t know if you exactly want to call it like the original sin, but it’s definitely like still the hottest, most argued over subject when it comes to pandemic response. And that’s school closures. Can you tell me what you thought about school policy, say, beginning in the spring of 2020, and to the extent that your thinking has changed over time? Explain a little bit about how that might have happened.

katelyn jetelina

Yeah, I have so many thoughts on this. To me, how we should think about the costs of school closures, there’s really only tough and tougher policy decisions during an emergency. I want to start with that. I do not envy decision makers in times of emergency because many decisions are trust jumps, whether we like it or not. And I think schools is a great example. So in Texas, we opened schools in fall of 2020. And I will say, I was not happy about it at the time. But I distinctly remember AAP’s strong recommendation to get kids in schools, because the reason I was having a really hard time with this in early 2020 is because in policy, we typically weigh benefits with risks. But what if we don’t know the risks at the time, right? It’s hard to remember how little we knew back then. Our children truly less risk than adults because this typically isn’t how viruses work. Do we throw immune naïve teachers into an environment without vaccines? Are schools supraspinatus for community? What will be the impact on multigenerational homes? Do masks work on a population level? And it also wasn’t clear what schools were actually doing if they were opening. And many school closures were, in part, harmful I would say, because low-income children didn’t have access to laptops or high speed internet, which local and state and even federal governments could have addressed, but they really didn’t. So looking back, I am glad we opened schools in fall of 2020. I was not happy about it, but I struggle because I don’t know what the answer would be for next time. Because the lessons learned from Covid-19 may not apply in the future, because again, like I said, this virus is really odd. Typically, viruses impact children and older adults the most because of their immune system. But that wasn’t the case here. And in the future, it may be. And so this risk benefit ratio of closing schools may change. And I think we really need to keep that in mind.

david wallace-wells

I guess my feeling was that it seemed perfectly reasonable in the spring — even as we knew a bit about the age skew, it seemed perfectly reasonable that if we were going into a quite aggressive Covid mitigation phase, a sort of a flatten the curve at all costs phase — it seemed perfectly reasonable to me that schools would close. I did wish that we did more over the spring and the summer to make more schools able to open in September than we’re ultimately able to. And I found myself frustrated over the course of that year that many places in many parts of the country were having a really hard time doing that, even as schools elsewhere in the world managed to open without — it seems really significant spillover effects on their populations. But I also thought that the costs of our continued lockdown have been somewhat overstated. And I wondered what you thought about the pandemic learning loss discussion. Because to me, we’ve had setbacks, all the measures — which are imperfect measures — but all the measures so that students suffered as a result of being out of school, although the correlations are not super clear at every level. In general, I think we can say that the country did worse during the pandemic years than in previous years. But they also — those losses seem relatively small to me given the scale of the rhetoric that we often hear, that this is a generational setback, and it may ultimately impose a larger cost on the country than the pandemic as a whole did. We’re talking about students performing on most of these national standardized tests at about the level they did some time around the year 2000. In some cases, they went back to their performance levels in 1998. In some cases, in 2003. And to my mind, if you had taken a poll of all the countries parents in the spring of 2020, and said, we’re going to be going through a really bumpy road. There’s going to be a lot of death in this country. There’s going to be a lot of struggle to limit disease spread, and there’s going to be a lot of political battle around all of those interventions. It’s going to be quite messy ugly time on almost any measure or metric that you use. And as a result of all of that disruption, your child will have the school experience that he or she might have had 20 years ago. I think that just about every parent would have been pretty happy taking that deal. And now, we’re looking at that same data and saying, this is not just a horrible loss. And it’s not just a policy problem that we should be endeavoring to ameliorate. But it is, in fact, somehow like the signal crime of the whole pandemic that we’ve put so much on the nation’s children and burdened them with so much in ways that were unnecessary and ultimately just dramatically harmful. And I just have a hard time seeing it that way. I wonder what your thoughts are.

katelyn jetelina

I have mixed feelings about this because I do see the harms. And as a mom, you don’t mess with my kids, right? I think the other challenge that’s also unfolding simultaneously with this is the correlation versus causation debate, particularly around not just the testing scores that you mentioned, but also mental health among kids right now. And I think a lot of people are linking lockdowns and no school to a rise in mental health without a broader context that actually we have had a rise in mental health even before the pandemic. A new study just came out that suicides did not increase during stay at home orders or schools closed. And so —

david wallace-wells

And in fact, there was an uptick when the schools reopened, right?

katelyn jetelina

Yeah, and there’s an uptick when the schools reopen. And so again, I think we’re getting really stuck into this debate of a false dichotomy, that you are either pro schools closing or anti-schools closing while in reality, I think we’re more on a spectrum. And it hits very close to home, because these are our kids, and we want them to be OK. I think kids are incredibly resilient, and they will be OK. They are just growing up in a very different time than we all grew up. And to us, that is unfamiliar and scary.

david wallace-wells

I don’t want to undersell the disruption of school closures and indeed, the pandemic as a whole on children. I think it was, in many ways, devastating for many kids. And the educational setbacks are real especially — we had made a lot of progress over the last 20 years. It just seems to me to be something that we might think — we might consider as part of the bundle of difficulty that we all struggled through over the last three years rather than something that should be set apart as an exceptional failure on the part of the country.

katelyn jetelina

I agree with you. I think the lesson really learned, though, is what you mentioned was that opening schools during our next pandemic because we’re going to have another pandemic should be a priority. And opening them in a safe way with 21st century tools, not these 19th century tools to fight a 21st century virus. And that is something I did not see happen play out in Texas, for example, where I was that we needed to prioritize — yeah opening, schools, but opening them safely. So we get the benefits of not super spreader events, but also the benefits of the safety and having food, and all the benefits structured learning has. And I hope that, that can be at the forefront of our mind going forward, even before the debate about opening businesses and venues and all of that, which if I remember correctly, which is all jumbled now took precedent over opening school safely.

david wallace-wells

Yeah, I mean, I think what you’re bringing us to is a useful perspective on which to close the conversation, which is that on all of these particular subjects, what we’re really talking about are trade offs. But we’re talking about those trade offs at a cultural level, at a political level in needlessly binary terms and not thinking smartly enough about exactly how to balance the different sets of interests. And if someone feels like, for instance, schools were closed too long, it seems like the default position they returned to is that schools should never have closed at all. And that just feels perhaps that ultimately in a different pandemic might be the right choice. It just seems like a hard thing to judge leaders for in this pandemic as we were sprinting through an incredibly panicked phase as a country. But I wanted to ask you about that bigger picture perspective, which is just to say, if these are all trade offs, and if one of the things that we should have learned over the course of this pandemic is how much each decision is a balancing act, a political balancing act, a social balancing act to some degree, like an emotional balancing act, are we in any better of a place in thinking through those trade offs than we were three years ago? Is it possible that we could respond to a next pandemic in a better way than we did this one?

katelyn jetelina

We’re in a worse position in some senses and a better position in others. How we respond to the next pandemic or the next novel threat is up to us right now. Yes, there’s going to be a new threat. It’s going to be probably very different than SARS-CoV-2 and how it looks and how it spreads. But that doesn’t mean all the lessons that we learned over the past three and a half years are not applicable, and that they won’t help. I go back to other countries that prepared after SARS and how well they did with SARS-CoV-2. And we have very smart modelers out there. We have very smart technology. And I think we just have to get smarter at working with each other. And one of the ways, I think, we do that is we need a Covid-19 commission, just like we had with 9-11, that really digs down into what we got right, but what we got wrong, and more importantly, why, and having a very honest conversation about this to move forward. And that’s just something I haven’t seen done, which has been disappointing.

david wallace-wells

It’s almost hard for me to imagine how that would play out in our current political environment. I mean, it just seems to me we’re sort of doomed to be living with an impoverished history here, that we’re so captive on almost all sides of the spectrum from almost all perspectives. We’re so captive to not just partisanship, but certain kinds of wishful thinking and coping mechanisms that we’re just not seeing what we went through clearly enough to learn from it, yes, but also just reckon with it and see clearly that we went through a world historical trauma. We have suffered enormously, especially those who died and those who were sick, but even those of us whose lives were just disrupted in more quotidian ways. We’re still quite discombobulated by that experience. And it feels, to me, really quite strange that we’re sort of walking like zombies out of that experience into a future without actually processing or seeing clearly what we went through. And I guess I’d like to think that a Covid-19 commission could give us the basis of a real factual history. But I don’t know. It seems so hard to imagine it unfolding at least in the context of Congress in this country. Probably for me, it would have to come from somewhere else, or some other civil society organization.

katelyn jetelina

I think you’re exactly right. Because it was so politically charged that the past three and a half years that I don’t know if it belongs in Congress. It may belong at a middle of the road foundation. I think I have less doom and gloom than you have. It takes time to process trauma. And at least, us in the public health world, and I’m sure also with reporters, we just haven’t had that time to self-reflect and to process. I haven’t, and it’s going to take time to heal and to understand and to try to hear the other side, and try to hear what we got wrong and how we can do better in the future.

david wallace-wells

Well, we always end the show with book recommendations. So Katelyn, what are three books that you’d recommend on Covid or about anything else?

katelyn jetelina

Yeah, I’ll give one Covid, but I’m like, sick of reading about Covid. [LAUGHS] So this summer, I’ve started —

david wallace-wells

You’re part of the problem, Katelyn. [LAUGHS]

katelyn jetelina

[LAUGHS] I am, but I’ve started digging into more fun books. But the one Covid one, if I were to recommend it to anyone, it’s called “Lessons from the Covid War: An Investigative Report.” I thought this book was absolutely spot on on the lessons we learned throughout the pandemic. It was written by the 9/11 commission director, and it has a lot of input from a lot of scientists around the United States. And I really enjoyed that book. The other books I’m reading right now beyond Covid is “Open” by Andre Agassi. It’s about a tennis player, and I never really cared about tennis before, but he is such a good storyteller. I’ve just been hooked this summer reading his story. So highly recommend that autobiography. And the other one that I just started is “Lessons in Chemistry,” which is pretty hilarious and light. And so I’ve appreciated just being able to escape in those two worlds.

david wallace-wells

Katelyn Jetelina, thanks so much for coming on the show.

The I.R.A. is sort of the Holy Roman Empire of legislation — as in being neither holy, nor Roman, nor an empire. That is, it isn’t actually about reducing inflation; it’s mainly a climate bill, using tax credits and subsidies to encourage the transition to a low-emission economy.

And it’s a big deal. Along with the CHIPS Act — Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors — the federal government is suddenly engaged in large-scale industrial policy, promoting particular sectors as opposed to the economy as a whole.

Incidentally, I wish Congress would pass the ETAA — End Tacky Acronyms Act. But never mind.

Anyway, the new turn to industrial policy has faced a lot of backlash from policy pundits, much of which boils down to, “Oh no, it’s the return of the Atari Democrats!” So it’s important to be clear that that’s not what any of this is about.

Here’s the story: Back in the 1980s, when Japan’s economic growth still inspired both admiration and alarm, some U.S. observers attributed the country’s success to government promotion of key industries. And there were members of Congress who wanted America to promote what they saw as cutting-edge companies, including video game producers."

The GATT/W.T.O. system doesn’t mandate any particular level of tariffs. It does, however, forbid countries from imposing new tariffs or other restrictions on international trade — in effect, it locks in the results of past trade agreements — except under certain specified conditions. One of these conditions, laid out in Article XXI, says that a nation may take action “which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests.”

If that sounds open-ended, that’s because it is. And Trump clearly abused the privilege, claiming that we needed tariffs on steel and aluminum to protect us from the menacing threat of … imports from Canada.

As it happens, the tariffs on Canadian metals are gone, as are most of the similar tariffs on Europe (although the agreement there stops short of full free trade). But the tariffs on China are still in place. More important, the Biden administration has declared that the W.T.O. has no jurisdiction in the matter: It’s up to America to determine whether its trade actions are necessary for national security, and an international organization has no right to second-guess that judgment.

Wait, what? According to the right, Biden and company are globalists, soft on China and unwilling to stand up for America. Why have they gotten so tough?"

More than 3,500 of those are considered invasive because they are harmful to their new ecosystems.

In the past week, as our town of South Lake Tahoe has absorbed rain from two more atmospheric rivers after 54 snow days this season, a gas station awning gave way, and gas pumps caught on fire. A house exploded because a propane tank’s pressure regulator vents were buried under snow. An apartment building collapsed, displacing its residents, and one family narrowly escaped a falling ceiling. Their little dog was crushed.

In the summer and fall, we breathe hazardous smoke and watch the fire maps, fretting that our homes will be devoured by flames; now we refresh weather apps on our phones, cringing at the precipitation forecasts and picturing our houses destroyed by ice. I used to count on winter as the season I could stop worrying and relax. But this winter, that’s impossible. The storms are coming in more frequently, and in some cases warmer and wetter than in the past, leading to catastrophic flooding, wet-snow avalanches and brutally heavy loads on our roofs.

The succession of storms this year is especially worrisome because they’re inundating a landscape that’s already compromised. Wildfire scars on the mountains mean the possibility of avalanches and landslides is far higher and, with them, road closures, evacuations and shelter-in-place orders."

In other words, our extremes are becoming more extreme.

For a recent issue of The New York Times Magazine, Christopher Cox tackled the question of how extreme weather could threaten California’s dams, an essential piece of the state’s complicated water storage and distribution system.

California is home to the tallest dam in America, located 60 miles north of Sacramento in Oroville. A failure of that dam would be catastrophic; in one particularly alarming scenario, it would send a wave more than 185 feet tall sweeping into the valley below, inundating several towns. When the St. Francis Dam in northern Los Angeles County failed in 1928, the disaster was one of the deadliest in state history.

But in a state threatened so regularly by Mother Nature, the risk of flooding from a dam failure doesn’t tend to get much attention. And that’s despite the fact that just six years ago, as Christopher reported, the Oroville Dam nearly failed."

And most Americans — 57 percent — disapprove of his handling of climate change, according to the poll. Surveys show young voters, who turned out in force during the 2020 election, are particularly concerned about global warming."

Next year it could be as small as two. Sixty recruitment emails had yielded one response: “I’m good.”

The overlooked truth is that student journalism is the rare opportunity students have to find and share their voice. Public schools are a microcosm of the America we see today — nowhere else do all groups of American society come together under a single roof and purpose. Nowhere else do we have such a perfect opportunity to tell untold stories. At its heart, the loss of student journalism means a loss of storytellers, a loss of perspective and a loss of seeing America for what it really is. Across the country student journalism is suffering. Today, 73 percent of New York City high schools don’t have school newspapers. That needs to change.

Let’s face the facts — Gen Z is less inclined to read in the first place. At the moment, less than 20 percent of teens report reading a book, magazine or newspaper for daily pleasure, while more than 80 percent report using social media every day. But Gen Z cares about the news; from climate change to school shootings we have proven time and time again that we are listening. So why the apathy toward student journalism?

A part of the problem is that suppressive legislation and restrictive school action targets student newspapers and minimizes the idea that student journalism is the student voice. In August of last year, a Nebraska student newspaper was shut down after publishing two columns on L.G.B.T.Q. issues. This year my own newspaper told the stories of the students affected by the passage of Senate File 496 by our Iowa State Senate, which, if approved, would require teachers to inform parents of any change in student pronouns. From crafting features to covering walkouts, our newsroom of eight battled injustice.

Yet it is social media, not student journalism, that Gen Z sees today as the opportunity to share their voice. The problem is, no one can tell a story in 60 seconds — at least not a full one."

But when pondering Europe’s longer-term future, there was plenty of fretting over President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act. The concern was voiced loudly in the ski town of Davos, Switzerland, that the law’s provision for $369 billion toward low-emissions energy and green technology would draw vast sums of investment and jobs away from Europe, cementing fears of deindustrialization on the continent.

Simmering for months, the complaint punctuated speeches and informal discussions from the main conference center to the back meeting rooms. The Europeans fear that companies will choose to build battery factories and electric vehicle assembly plants and other major projects in the United States to benefit from the tax credits and other incentives in the law that encourage local manufacturing. That could mean that production in Europe would be diverted to the United States, or businesses could simply pick the United States over Europe for future projects.

The new law, for example, provides buyers of electric vehicles a federal tax credit of up $7,500 — but only if those vehicles are made in North America."

In 1979, for instance, Americans consumed about 10.8 kilowatts per person. In 2019 we consumed about 9.2 kilowatts a person. To a conservationist, this looks like progress, though not nearly enough, as a glance at CO2 emissions will confirm. To Hall, it was a civilizational catastrophe.

His titular flying car stands in for all that we were promised in the mid-20th century but don’t yet have: flying cars, of course, but also lunar bases, nuclear rockets, atomic batteries, nanotechnology, undersea cities, affordable supersonic air travel and so on. Hall harvests these predictions and many more from midcentury sci-fi writers and prognosticators and sorts them according to their cost in energy. What he finds is that the marvels we did manage — the internet, smartphones, teleconferencing, Wikipedia, flat-screen televisions, streaming video and audio content, mRNA vaccines, rapidly advancing artificial intelligence, to name just a few — largely required relatively little energy and the marvels we missed would require masses of it.

But they are possible. We’ve flown plenty of flying car prototypes over the decades. The water crises of the future could be solved by mass desalination. Supersonic air travel is a solved technological problem. Lunar bases lie well within the boundaries of possibility. The path that Richard Feynman, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, outlined for nanotechnology — build machines that are capable of building smaller machines that are capable of building smaller machines that are capable of, well, you get it — still seems plausible. What we need is energy — much, much more of it. But Hall thinks we’ve become an “ergophobic” society, which he defines as a society gripped by “the almost inexplicable belief that there is something wrong with using energy.”

Here, Hall’s account drips with contempt for anyone who does not dive out of the way of today’s industrialists. He reaches back to old H.G. Wells stories to find the right metaphor for where our civilization went sideways, finding it in the feckless Eloi, a post-human race that collapsed into the comforts of abundance. The true conflict, he says, is not between the haves and the have-nots but between the doers and the do-nots. “The do-nots favor stagnation and are happy turning our civilization into a collective couch potato,” he writes. And in his view, the do-nots are winning.

“Where Is My Flying Car?” is a work of what I’d call reactionary futurism. It loves the progress technology can bring; it can’t stand the soft, flabby humans who stand in the future’s way. There is nothing inexplicable about why country after country sought energy conservation or why it remains an aim. A partial list would include poisoned rivers and streams, smog-choked cities, the jagged edge of climate change and ongoing mass extinction and the geopolitical costs of being hooked on oil from Saudi Arabia and gas from Russia."

The government “must conduct its relations impartially,” the motion read, “and not allow our independent and sovereign nation to be sucked into a game it does not want and to be used inappropriately by competing nations to exert dominance in our region.”

Mr. Kilman, the new prime minister, has already indicated that the accord with Australia, which calls on the nations to establish “efficient and effective security cooperation” and which has not yet been ratified by Vanuatu’s Parliament, may be abandoned or substantially changed.

“At this point in time, I am not sure whether it is in the best interests of Vanuatu or not,” he told reporters on Tuesday. “If it is not all good, and there needs to be some changes, then we speak with Australia to see what we can do together to make it something workable.”

Mr. Kilman, who is now taking his fifth turn as the country’s prime minister, is widely described as being more open to Chinese cooperation than his predecessor. In 2012, he made headlines after he expelled all Australian police officers in retaliation for what he described as “disrespectful” treatment during a visit to Australia. Three years later, after his return to the prime ministerial role, he met with Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, and pledged closer ties between the two countries."

It could amount to the most consequential diplomatic push of Mr. Biden’s presidency. He is betting that high-level dialogue can itself act as a ballast in a relationship that has been in a dangerous free fall for years. “I think there is a way to resolve, to establish a working relationship with China that benefits them and us,” Mr. Biden said in a CNN interview broadcast on Sunday, as Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen was ending her visit to Beijing.

Ms. Yellen met for hours with China’s premier, Li Qiang, and with a vice premier and top economic aide to Mr. Xi who was relatively unknown to U.S. officials — a sign that these exchanges might help establish important one-on-one channels. Since May, the C.I.A. director and the secretary of state have also traveled to Beijing, and the special climate envoy and the commerce secretary are following soon.

Mr. Biden and his aides say forging these personal ties could be necessary for defusing crises between the world’s two main superpowers. But the recent visits have also thrown into sharp relief the worsening structural problems in the relationship, ones that some analysts say could lead to armed conflict if mismanaged."

The night before a critical summit, in a sudden reversal, Turkey agreed to accept Sweden’s application for membership of NATO. The shift came just hours after Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said the E.U. should first advance his country’s bid to join the bloc before he would clear the path for Sweden.

NATO’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said that Erdogan would take the country’s bid to his Parliament for ratification as soon as possible. In return, Sweden and Turkey would work bilaterally against terrorism, Sweden would help reinvigorate Turkey’s application to enter the E.U., and NATO would establish a new “special coordinator for counterterrorism,” he said.

The decision followed intense pressure, particularly from President Biden, who called Erdogan on Sunday. A statement by Biden afterward was widely interpreted as an indication that the U.S. would sell Turkey the fighter jets it had demanded. Analysts said the Turkish leader had likely decided that his political brinkmanship would not reap further gains.

Summit: Leaders of member nations will meet today in Lithuania, as they prepare for what could be a long war to repel Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, of which NATO is a critical supplier of arms and training."

“The ski bum mentality is always, ‘Never pay retail,’” she said. “That changes with age, money and access, of course, but most people here still live by it.”

While ski swaps are a time-honored tradition in many mountain communities, online dealers of used alpine gear — including boots, jackets, skis and snowboards — are growing, expanding the resale practice to a wider virtual audience, enticing newcomers to try snow sports at bargain prices and promoting recycling in an era of climate-changed snow totals.

I remember talking about the lyrics in history class.”

According to Mr. Wentz, instead of a straight cover of the song, the band wanted to amend the lyrics to reflect the 34 years that had passed since its release.

“I listen to Billy Joel’s and so many of the things in it are either massive moments or just kind of shoulder shrugs within history now,” he wrote. “It’s interesting to see what he referenced from the ’50s and ’60s and what he didn’t. And in some ways it’s just etchings inside of a cave — documentation that we existed and these things happened, both triumphant and terrible. We made this song for ourselves and then we hoped our fans would have fun with it.”

Brady Gerber is a rock music critic who contributes to New York and Pitchfork. As a fan of the original, he is quite fond of Fall Out Boy’s take.

“I think every generation gets their own ‘We Didn’t Start the Fire,’” Mr. Gerber said. “I still think the melody is really catchy and fun. And I remember that the initial reaction to Billy Joel’s original version wasn’t really great. I think a lot of people actually hated the song at the time. So it’s funny, because I’m also seeing a lot of people criticizing the song thinking it’s ridiculous, but it’s also just a ridiculous song to begin with.”"

About a mile east, the Arab Image Foundation also suffered terrible damage, including to storage spaces where photography collections were kept. There, Cultural Emergency Response helped repair windows, secure storage spaces, and ensure that the foundation and its collections had survived.

“Usually people think about heritage as just being historical buildings or collections,” Ms. Letschert explained. “Heritage is part of a wider ecosystem of culture.”

When an earthquake hit Turkey and Syria in February, killing more than 50,000 people, the organization intervened, supporting teams on the ground to document the damage and the threats to buildings, sites, collections and cultural spaces, and figuring out “what we can do, what the priorities are and who we can work with,” Ms. Letschert said. She added that the organization had raised about $290,000 for the rescue effort and was processing applications from partner organizations that are wanting to help.

Today, there is less for Cultural Emergency Response to do in the Middle East because so many other cultural preservation bodies are involved in rescuing the area’s cultural sites, Ms. Letschert said. The organization’s priority is to “go where others are not going and try to serve areas and communities that are often overlooked.”

One area that has required urgent attention is what Ms. Letschert calls “natural violence,” the increasingly frequent and severe spells of extreme weather triggered by climate change. In Guatemala, for example, heavy rains and storms are endangering key Maya heritage sites, particularly in more remote areas."

At Exxon Mobil’s annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, activist investors and big shareholders, including Legal & General Investment Management, will take on the company with a series of proxy measures aiming to push it to cut emissions and speed its decarbonization efforts.

Climate investors aren’t expecting a triumphant repeat of what happened two years ago, when Engine No. 1, a San Francisco-based activist hedge fund, stunned the corporate world by landing three of its eco-conscious nominees on Exxon’s board.

Climate activists and others told DealBook that Engine No. 1’s efforts have achieved negligible results, Vivienne Walt writes. Here’s what they say:

“Exxon has continued to invest aggressively in expanding its oil and gas production,” said Mark Kramer, senior lecturer at Harvard Business School, who wrote a case study last year on Engine No. 1.

Engine No. 1 “has not made a discernible difference in the way Exxon is addressing climate change,” said Danielle Fugere, president and chief counsel of As You Sow, an investor advocacy group in Berkeley, Calif., that leads shareholder campaigns and has submitted resolutions for Wednesday’s meeting.

Mark van Baal, founder of the activist shareholder group Follow This, was more blunt. The hedge fund, he said, was “the biggest disappointment in the fight against climate change.”

Engine No. 1 rejected that assessment. In an email to DealBook, it highlighted a string of changes at Exxon, including the introduction of net-zero targets for its Permian Basin operations in Texas and New Mexico, early-stage carbon-capture and hydrogen projects, and investments in lithium mining. “None of those initiatives were in the company’s plans before Engine No. 1’s engagement,” a spokesman said.

But critics say that green investments are still a tiny percentage of Exxon’s spending, and that the company remains committed to fossil fuels. They also wonder if the green-energy push has more to do with Inflation Reduction Act subsidies and tax incentives than a genuine transition."

What’s Up? (Feb. 19-25)

A Precipitous Fall

Carlos Watson, the founder of Ozy Media, a digital media start-up that attracted funding from high-profile investors, was arrested by the F.B.I. on Thursday and charged with fraud and aggravated identity theft more than a year after the company announced it was shutting down. In court filings, prosecutors said Mr. Watson had been “engaged in a scheme to defraud Ozy’s potential investors, potential acquirers, lenders and potential lenders” by misrepresenting its audience numbers and financial results. In September 2021, The New York Times wrote about an instance in which a top official at Ozy appeared to have posed as a YouTube executive on a call with Goldman Sachs bankers, assuring them that Ozy’s videos performed well on the platform, when Ozy was trying to raise $40 million. Mr. Watson later identified Samir Rao, the company’s former chief operating officer, as the impersonator. Mr. Rao and Suzee Han, Ozy’s former chief of staff, previously pleaded guilty to related charges.

Change at the World Bank

The Biden administration tapped Ajay Banga, a former head of Mastercard, to be the next president of the World Bank, a pick aimed at reshaping the organization’s priorities around climate change. The current president, David Malpass, who was picked by President Donald J. Trump, recently announced that he would step down by the end of June. He had come under fire for his views on the issue after he sidestepped an interview question about whether he accepted the scientific consensus linking fossil fuels and global warming. “I’m not a scientist,” he said during the exchange, which took place in September at a New York Times event. While former Vice President Al Gore, known for his climate work, praised the nomination of Mr. Banga, Mr. Biden’s choice drew criticism from some activists who had hoped for someone with a stronger climate background.

The Fed’s Resolve

While investors on Wall Street have been more bullish recently about the outlook for interest rates, minutes from the Federal Reserve’s last meeting showed that officials felt they had more work to do to slow down the economy and bring inflation under control. According to the notes, “all participants” believed it was necessary to continue raising rates, and many thought that easing the central bank’s monetary policy now would risk halting the progress it had made in moderating inflation. While prices have begun to climb more slowly, data released since the Fed’s Jan. 31-Feb. 1 meeting have included worrisome signs of inflation’s staying power. According to a fresh reading on Friday from the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge — the measure on which it bases its 2 percent inflation target — price increases unexpectedly picked up in January after slowing in recent months.

What’s Next? (Feb. 26-March 4)

Student Loan Cancellation

Supreme Court justices will hear arguments on Tuesday on whether President Biden’s executive action to cancel billions of dollars in student debt is constitutional. Mr. Biden announced the policy in August, saying he would wipe out up to $20,000 per borrower who met certain criteria. While celebrated by the millions of borrowers who would be eligible for the program and by progressive Democrats who had long been pushing for such a measure, Mr. Biden’s plan faced swift backlash from political opponents and led to several lawsuits accusing the president of overstepping his authority and depriving states of future tax revenue. Justices put the case on an unusually fast track after the Justice Department filed an emergency application asking the Supreme Court to lift an injunction put in place by a lower court that blocked the policy from going into effect."

The Trump-free spell, it seemed, was broken.

Since his rise eight years ago, Mr. Trump has sucked the oxygen out of Republican gatherings, from the halls of Congress to the fairgrounds of Iowa. The manufactured environment of the debate seemed to remind Republicans what it was like to breathe, politically speaking, in Trumpless rooms.

On abortion, all the candidates declared themselves “pro-life.” But they disagreed on the specifics of that pledge in a post-Roe world. Former Vice President Mike Pence supported a federal ban. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida indicated that states should be allowed to set their own restrictions, despite signing a six-week ban in his home state. And Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina, urged Republicans to “stop demonizing” the issue, saying that the party lacked the votes to pass any kind of federal restriction."

Russian news reports estimate that Russia’s natural gas exports by pipeline could fall as much as 50 percent in volume this year from last year. The drop points to the blow to Russia’s vital gas exports industry since the country invaded Ukraine.

Once Europe’s main supplier of natural gas, Russia has been subjected to heavy sanctions from the West since the invasion in February 2022. Europe’s main strategy for reducing dependence on Russian energy — increasing imports of liquefied natural gas from countries like the U.S., coupled with slashing demand — has worked surprisingly well.

While Russia has been able to hold its own in the oil market despite embargoes, it is much more difficult to find new customers for gas because it is still mostly transported through fixed pipelines. Russia is likely to see some gain in gas sales to China and Turkey, but evidence is piling up that its natural gas export industry may be steadily disintegrating."

The radiation she got from her visit — about two chest X-rays’ worth — was worth the education she received on the tour, she told her 8.6 million Instagram followers. She then spoke admiringly of France, which, she said, “recycles their waste, increasing the efficiency of their system and reducing the overall amount of radioactive waste to deal with.”

Progressive lawmakers, along with environmental groups like the Sierra Club and Natural Resources Defense Council, have historically been against nuclear power — often focusing on the danger, longevity and storage requirements of the radioactive waste. During the 2020 presidential campaign, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said, “It doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to me to add more dangerous waste to this country and to the world when we don’t know how to get rid of what we have right now.” Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts echoed these concerns and pledged not to build any new nuclear plants if elected president.

So it’s no surprise that many Americans believe nuclear waste poses an enormous and terrifying threat. But after talking to engineers, radiation specialists and waste managers, I’ve come to see this misunderstanding is holding us back from embracing a powerful, clean energy source we need to tackle climate change. We must stop seeing nuclear waste as a dangerous problem and instead recognize it as a safe byproduct of carbon-free power.

Why is nuclear so important for reducing carbon emissions? The countries that have cleaned up their electricity production the fastest have generally done so with hydroelectric power, nuclear, or a combination of the two. The distinct advantage of nuclear is that it requires little land and can reliably produce lots of power regardless of weather, time of day or season. Unlike wind and solar, it can substitute directly for fossil fuels without backup or storage. The International Energy Agency believes it’s so crucial that global nuclear capacity must double by 2050 to reach net-zero emissions targets."

American girls are in crisis — on that much we can all agree. In a 2021 study of young women’s mental health, a vast number of respondents between ages 12 and 19 answered that they had felt “persistently sad or hopeless”; rates of sexual assault and violence in the same population are alarmingly high. As caregivers, many of us are looking for ways to shore up our children’s well-being, self-esteem and happiness. And although it is not the aim of a historical survey to be prescriptive, heartening inspiration can be found in “Young and Restless,” Mattie Kahn’s thoroughgoing examination of the role of young women and girls in America’s uprisings.

Her subjects have agitated on behalf of labor and voting rights, racial dignity and equality, sexual and reproductive freedom, freedom of speech and against climate change. The solutions she illustrates include objecting, resisting — and, yes, acting up, rather than sinking into sadness and accepting the unacceptable. By taking direct action in the service of shared values, in alliance with beloved communities for a better future, girls throughout American history have discovered a sense of personal agency, often during eras when their opportunities were sharply circumscribed. Sometimes they even changed history.

Kahn, whose stated aim is to write girls back into the historical record, also considers her subjects’ lives before and after their time in the trenches. Many of the young women who took on activist roles — especially those who lived before the mid-20th century — faced intense blowback, even as they inspired others to their causes. The book also examines the place of childhood itself as a battleground on which America’s culture wars have historically been fought."

There’s Mabel Ping-Hua Lee, who at 17 led 17,000 people up New York City’s Fifth Avenue on horseback in the 1912 march for women’s suffrage, while her mother “rode in a car at the march along with a delegation of Chinese women who could not march because their feet had been bound.” “America’s Joan of Arc,” Anna Elizabeth Dickenson, gained fame as an abolitionist orator in her teens and would become the first woman to address the House of Representatives.

After World War II came a generation of youthful reproductive rights activists. We meet Heather Tobis (later Booth), who, at 19, founded the legendary abortion referral service Jane out of her dorm room. Clyde Marie Perry, 17, and Emma Jean Wilson, 14, integrated their Grenada, Miss., schools in 1966 and then successfully sued to stop expulsions of pregnant students like themselves.

Some of the activists were forgotten because later laws, like Title IX, overrode the significance of their achievements: like Faye Ordway, 18, who was expelled for pregnancy in 1971 and took the school board of her Massachusetts town to court, winning for herself and other pregnant minors the right to an education; and Alice de Rivera, the 13-year-old “crusader in miniskirts” who fought for the right to take the entrance exam to Stuyvesant High School in New York, which in 1969 had never admitted a woman.

Others have seen their stories more recently resurrected and achieved some measure of recognition. Claudette Colvin was arrested at 15, in 1955, for refusing to give up her Montgomery, Ala., bus seat to a white passenger, nine months before Rosa Parks — the leader of Colvin’s local N.A.A.C.P. Youth Council chapter — did the same. “She didn’t want to be soothed. She wanted change,” Kahn writes of the Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, one of the most famous young voice of our own era.

“I felt that I belonged to the world, that there was something for me to do in it, though I had not yet found out what,” wrote Lucy Larcom in her memoir of her time in the Lowell mills. “Something to do; it might be very little, but still it would be my own work.” Today, in the book’s words, stories of remarkable girls “abound.” But, as Kahn deftly shows, that’s been the story of these revolutionaries from the start."

The organization, based in Oakland, is the largest private employer in the state, operating 36 hospitals and more than 500 medical office buildings in California. It provides coverage to roughly half of all Californians with private health insurance.

So it’s an especially big deal for the state that Kaiser employees have begun what labor leaders are calling the biggest health care strike in recent U.S. history. The three-day action includes more than 75,000 workers in eight states and the District of Columbia, with more than 60,000 of those workers in California.

The strike, which includes laboratory workers, pharmacy technicians, phlebotomists and housekeepers, could cause delays for patients who are trying to get medical appointments, lab results or prescriptions.

Doctors and many nurses are not involved in the strike, but Kaiser officials warned that even so, some nonurgent procedures might be postponed, some clinic hours might be reduced and phone waiting times could be lengthy. Some locations have also closed temporarily or are operating with reduced hours. Kaiser has said that it is keeping all of its hospitals and emergency departments open."

Mr. Biden noted that Mr. Putin had shown no interest yet in ending his invasion, but said that if that changed, “I’ll be happy to sit down with Putin to see what he has in mind.”

Evidently determined to present a united front during a White House news conference that at times resembled a love fest, Mr. Macron said that France would increase its military support for Ukraine and “will never urge Ukrainians to make a compromise that will not be acceptable for them.”

In effect, the two leaders met each other halfway, with Mr. Biden showing more openness to a negotiated settlement and Mr. Macron more unequivocal support for the Ukrainian cause. If partially choreographed, the meeting of minds appeared to exceed expectations on both sides."

Snowfall has been lacking around much of New York, with many locations seeing dismal accumulations. Rochester recorded less than nine inches of snow in January, its lowest total for the month since 1946.

And at mountains around New York, skiers are finding fewer open trails this season and a lot of machine-made snow.

At least 400 wildfires burning across Canada have triggered air pollution warnings across North America. The smoke hovered over major cities in Canada and the northern U.S., blotting out the sun and bringing home the realities of climate change for people who have rarely experienced the effects of forest fires firsthand.

In the U.S., warnings were in effect across a wide portion of the Northeast and Midwest. Philadelphia was under a “code red,” meaning sensitive groups could be at risk. In New York City, the air quality was the worst since the Environmental Protection Agency began measurements in 1999. Experts warned that the air in Toronto and elsewhere was likely to worsen in the coming days. Here’s a map of the smoke.

“I left a window open last night and the top of my laptop, the desk and the window sill all had ash on them,” my colleague Ian Austen told us from Toronto. “I could’ve written my name in it.”

Even though it’s not officially summer yet in the Northern Hemisphere, it’s already a season of extremes. Puerto Rico is under a severe heat alert. The oceans have rapidly heated up. The events show how unprepared the world’s richest continent is for the hazards of the not-too-distant future."

In December, shortly after ChatGPT’s release, someone in management — Mr. Pichai swears it wasn’t him — declared a “code red,” instructing employees to shift time and resources toward A.I. projects. The company also established a fast-track review process to get A.I. projects out more quickly. And Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Google’s co-founders, who took a hands-off approach for years, rolled up their sleeves to help. The company plans to release a raft of new A.I. products this year and plug the technology into many of its existing ones. (This week, it began testing a new Gmail feature that allows users to compose A.I.-generated emails.)

On Thursday, Mr. Pichai expressed both optimism and worry about the state of the A.I. race.

He gave a blunt assessment of Bard, the ChatGPT competitor that Google released last week to tepid reviews: “I feel like we took a souped-up Civic and kind of put it in a race with more powerful cars.” (He also broke some news: Bard, which currently runs on a version of an A.I. language model called LaMDA, will soon be upgraded to a more powerful model, known as PaLM.)

He reacted to a recent open letter, signed by nearly 2,000 technology leaders and researchers, that urged companies to pause development of powerful A.I. systems for at least six months to prevent “profound risks to society.” Mr. Pichai doesn’t agree with all of the letter’s details — and he wouldn’t commit to slowing down Google’s A.I. efforts — but he said that the letter’s cautionary message was “worth being out there.”

And he talked about the “whiplash” he often feels when it comes to A.I. these days, as some people urge companies like Google to move faster on A.I., release more products and take bigger risks, while others urge them to slow down and be more cautious.

“You will see us be bold and ship things,” he said, “but we are going to be very responsible in how we do it.”"

But sell it has. Since its release in 2020, Mr. Saito’s book “Capital in the Anthropocene” has sold more than 500,000 copies, exceeding his wildest imaginings.

The United States needs 47,300 gigawatt-miles of new power lines by 2035, which would expand the current grid by 57 percent, the Energy Department reported in February. A 2021 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine arrived at a similar figure. To hit that target, the United States needs to double the pace of power line construction.

The current power grid was constructed over more than a century. Building what amounts to a new power grid on a similar scale in a small fraction of that time is a daunting challenge. It will require tens of billions of dollars in financing, vast quantities of steel and aluminum and thousands of specialized workers. But building is the easy part. What makes the target virtually impossible to hit is the byzantine approval process that typically includes separate reviews by every municipality and state through which a power line will pass, as well as a host of federal agencies.

In 2005, for instance, the largest power company in Arizona proposed to build a transmission line to carry electricity to its customers from a new wind farm in Wyoming. Last month, after 18 years of legal battles and hearings and revisions, the TransWest Express project was finally approved. It still won’t be completed until 2028 at the earliest, though."

California has long cycled through spells of deluge and drought, in part because of natural climate variability. But research suggests that a warmer climate has supercharged the “whiplash” between these extremes.

Second, even an extremely wet winter isn’t a magic bullet for the long-term water concerns in the state, which have been exacerbated by years of extreme aridity, rising temperatures and unsustainable water use.

California’s groundwater aquifers have huge potential for storing water; they can hold eight to 12 times as much as all of the state’s major reservoirs combined. But, they have been badly depleted by decades of heavy pumping, especially in the agriculture-heavy Central Valley. Data suggests that groundwater supplies in the region decline precipitously during dry periods, recovering only modestly during wet ones.

When it comes to replenishing those aquifers, the state has had trouble capturing water from downpours and redirecting it to fields and sandy basins where it can seep underground, experts say. That means we still have a long way to go in restoring our groundwater supplies.

Heavy influxes of rain and snow during the winter can also have destructive repercussions later in the year. The state’s record-level snowpack could mean more flooding in the spring as the snow melts, especially if much of the soil is already saturated with water and can’t absorb much more of it."

President Emmanuel Macron pushed through contentious legislation to raise France’s retirement age — without a full vote in parliament. The decision inflamed tensions and set the stage for a no-confidence vote against his government.

The move, which allows the retirement age to be raised to 64 from 62, drew calls for more protests after two months of mass demonstrations and strikes. In parliament, opposition lawmakers sang the national anthem and banged on their desks. On the streets, protesters pledged to continue the fight.

Macron used a constitutional measure to enact the bill without putting it to a vote in the National Assembly, the lower and more powerful house of Parliament. The upper house, the Senate, approved the bill. Macron’s party and its allies hold only a slim majority in the National Assembly and did not have enough votes to pass the bill.

The decision to avoid a vote is legal — but will be regarded by Macron’s opponents as anti-democratic. A no-confidence vote in the National Assembly is expected in the coming days, most likely on Monday, but it’s unlikely to succeed. If it did pass, it would bring down his prime minister and the cabinet, and the bill would be rejected."

Fences keep livestock in and predators out, and both were imperative for the settlers drawn to the Great Plains by the government’s promises of free land. But on the Plains in the mid-19th century, newcomers found that timber was scarce, stone walls were impractical and living fences, usually thorny hedges of Osage orange, took years to grow.

Entrepreneurs raced to create an alternative, and in 1874, an Illinois farmer named Joseph Glidden filed a patent for two wires twisted together and armed with metal barbs. By 1880, manufacturers were making roughly a half-million miles of it every year, promising not only security but also a sense of ownership: As John Steinbeck’s Tom Joad says of his father, fences “give him a feelin’ that 40 was 40.” Since then, barbed wire has become a fundamental part of the landscape of the American West.

Mike Wilson, a rancher in northern Washington State, uses it to keep his herds safe, as his father and grandfather did. But in 2021, when Mr. Wilson and his wife, Joy, leased about 9,000 acres of rocky, high-elevation grazing land from the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, they built no physical fences at all. Instead they joined a pilot program for a technology designed to fence in their cattle virtually rather than physically. It starts with two solar-powered base stations, about the size of an upright piano, topped with a 20-foot-tall radio antenna.

The base stations communicate with GPS-enabled collars worn by 145 of their grazing cows, creating a system that the Wilsons can control from a laptop — even while sitting at their kitchen table some 35 miles away. If a cow approaches one of the invisible fence lines, her collar emits a series of warning beeps. If she tries to cross it, the collar releases a low-voltage shock."

A day after the first military strike to hit civilian areas in Moscow, Kremlin officials jumped on the refusal of Ukraine’s allies to condemn the attack as proof that Russia’s real war was with the West.

None of Ukraine’s allies went so far as to endorse the drone attack, but Britain’s foreign secretary said that Kyiv had “the right to project force beyond its borders.” The U.S. response also stopped short of criticizing the drone strike, which Ukrainian officials have said they were not “directly involved” in.

Dmitri Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia’s national security council and a former president, said Britain “de facto is leading an undeclared war against Russia” by providing Ukraine with military support. He argued that now any British official “can be considered as a legitimate military target.”

Context: Russia has repeatedly hit civilian areas of Ukraine during the war, though it has denied targeting nonmilitary sites. In recent weeks it has turned up the barrage of missiles and attack drones aimed at Kyiv, the capital. Thousands of Ukrainian civilians, including children, have been killed in Russian airstrikes and artillery bombardments, U.N. officials say."

Populations of some of the large marine mammals are just starting to recover after the kind of predation described in the novel “Moby-Dick,” while others face ongoing peril to their existence. But it turns out that whaling’s effects on where whales live go back much deeper into human history.

A new analysis of ancient whale bones, published Wednesday in the journal Royal Society Open Science, suggests that medieval European hunting may have played a role in some whales disappearing from northeast Atlantic waters long before Captain Ahab, Ishmael and the Pequod sought their great white whale.

As early as 8,000 years ago, humans carved their attempts to capture whales into South Korean cliffs. More recently, medieval texts described the whaling preferences of Europeans. For instance, an Old Norse text from around 1250 A.D. cautions that “there are certain varieties that are fierce and savage toward men and are constantly seeking to destroy them at every chance,” but other, more docile species of whales “are constantly being caught and driven to land by the hundreds, and where many are caught, they provide much food for men.”

Youri van den Hurk, a zooarchaeologist at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and an author of the study, wanted to back up the information in these texts with physical, biological evidence. So he and his colleagues examined 719 pieces of whale bones collected at archaeological sites from Norway to Portugal."

All were affected as storm drains backed up and the basements were flooded with up to 25 feet of water “at an unprecedented rate” during the storm on Sept. 29, the statement said.

No animals were harmed or had to be moved, but the flooding caused “millions of dollars of damage,” said Craig Piper, the vice president of city zoos for the Wildlife Conservation Society, which runs the Prospect Park Zoo, along with the Bronx, Queens and Central Park zoos and the New York Aquarium. “As we move from triage to restoration of the facilities, we will continue to assess when we will reopen to the public.” The zoo’s extended closure was previously reported by Gothamist.

The water has been pumped out of the basements and the zoo is now drawing its power from generators; it will use temporary boilers for heat as needed, the statement said. Photos inside zoo buildings showed cleanup and restoration equipment being stored next to animal exhibits."

Do we dare to hope? This was the question addressed to the 11th Athens Democracy Forum, against a backdrop of war in Europe, unchecked climate change, galloping inflation and the A.I. revolution with its specter of “robots with glaring red eyes,” as Nick Clegg, the president of global affairs for Meta, put it.

Mr. Clegg dismissed those sinister visions — A.I. can slice and dice vast amounts of data, he pointed out, and is adept at pattern recognition but does not even know the meaning of the words it uses. Fear has always accompanied the arrival of new technologies, but the worst is far from inevitable.

The Greek economy has surged from the desperate state it was in a decade ago. The weather was overcast and cool, with no hint of the climate extremes Greece has experienced of late. The war in Ukraine drags on and takes a terrible toll, but the front lines have scarcely moved in a year. Perhaps attendees of the forum could be forgiven for feeling intimations of imminent global cataclysm are overblown.

Still, there was no consensus on hope. Democracy has taken a beating in recent years with the rise of autocratic states and attacks around the world on a free press and independent judiciaries. Democratic societies have suffered from self-satisfied blindness to their eternal fragility and from acceptance of forms of injustice — especially growing inequality — that undermine consensus. Even the claim of democracy to the moral high ground is now questioned, a theme that was consistently aired in Athens."

As consumer patterns have changed since the start of the pandemic, food companies have experienced significant demand. The war in Ukraine and extreme weather, such as droughts and floods, also disrupted supply chains, causing companies to get ingredients and goods from different suppliers.

At PepsiCo, which began setting targets to reduce emissions in 2015, emissions in its supply chain are up 7 percent from its baseline, according to its 2022 climate report. Chipotle, which set a goal of halving its emissions by 2030, reported a 26 percent surge in supply chain and other emissions in its 2022 report.

“This has got to be about performance, not promises,” said Barry Parkin, the chief procurement and sustainability officer at the privately held candy and pet food giant Mars, one of the large companies that reported a decline in emissions. “We’ve had five years of companies making promises and being celebrated for the quality of their promises and not their performance.”

The global food system, which accounts for a third of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, is under pressure from consumers and investors to create tangible plans to reduce that output.

Evidence is mounting that Russia’s natural gas export industry has fallen apart since the country invaded Ukraine. New estimates suggest that Russia’s pipeline exports could drop by half this year compared with last year.

The problems are not limited to gas delivered by pipeline. The E.U. is also threatening to curtail imports of liquefied natural gas from Russia, which were the Russian industry’s only bright spot last year. And last year was an especially bad year.

Russia will most likely see gains in gas sales to China and Turkey, but China is just a fraction of the market that Europe used to be. Russia has fared surprisingly well despite Western embargoes but has had to sell at a discount. Looking ahead, Russia will also struggle to find new buyers: Most of its fuel moves through pipelines, which are geographically fixed, unlike liquefied natural gas, which can be transported like oil on ships.

Alternative sources: Europe has worked to reduce its dependence on Russian energy by cutting demand and finding alternatives. Norway is now its largest natural gas supplier. Europe has also come to rely on liquefied natural gas from the U.S."

Ford’s River Rouge plant, then the world’s largest factory, ultimately inspired facilities by Renault, Volkswagen, Toyota and the Russian automaker Gaz. It also gave rise to the nightmarish wartime economies of World War II, when tanks, planes and toxic chemicals rolled off assembly lines worldwide.

Those engineers weren’t in Detroit just out of curiosity. They knew they had to catch up to American methods. As one Weimar conservative said, Germany had to “study the means and mechanisms of the Americans” or become “America’s prey.”

Now, America is in its own game of economic catch-up — in the booming area of clean energy. As of this year, China is the world’s largest car exporter — thanks to a surging electric vehicle industry — and it commands at least 74 percent market share in each step of the solar panel supply chain. China learned to master the solar, battery and electric vehicle industries through the 2010s, while the United States was debating whether to pass clean-energy policy — and even whether climate change existed at all. With the Inflation Reduction Act, the United States now has an opportunity to become more competitive, and nothing gets lawmakers from across the political spectrum pumped up faster than the prospect of crushing China.

But the United States cannot build a competitive renewable or electric vehicle industry from scratch. The history of innovation — and of the modern world, frankly — shows that American engineers will progress in these industries only when they can work with their Chinese counterparts."

Both nuclear powers, they share a 2,100-mile border, and lay claim to territories controlled by the other. China has been increasing its clout in Nepal and Bhutan, which have long been Indian spheres of influence. For decades, Beijing and New Delhi maintained a cold peace, but the growing muscular nationalism in Xi Jinping’s China and Narendra Modi’s India eventually led to confrontations on the disputed border in 2020 in which scores of Indian and Chinese soldiers were killed.

More recently, tensions rose on Dec. 9 after Indian and Chinese forces clashed on the mountainous border near the northeastern Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, which China calls South Tibet. Relations between China and India have been further soured after joint military exercises last month by the United States and India near the India-China border. The Biden administration has also stepped up efforts to deepen its cooperation with the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, the informal security alliance of India, Australia, Japan and the United States that seeks to counter China’s rise, a grouping that Beijing views as hostile.

The shared challenge of China has pushed America and India closer. For the past two decades, Republican and Democratic administrations have made India an essential partner in the American strategy to contain China. The Biden administration’s National Defense Strategy report calls for enhancing India’s ability to deter China’s aggression “and ensure free and open access to the Indian Ocean region.” American encouragement of India’s rise has rare bipartisan support, which makes the absence of a U.S. ambassador in India even more surprising.

There are significant economic reasons for greater American engagement with India, which recently surpassed Britain as the world’s fifth largest economy. While India remains poor in per capita terms (it has roughly $2,200 in G.D.P. per person), it is one of the fastest growing major economies and a vital market for trade and investment.

India is a major supplier of pharmaceuticals, including vaccines to the world. In 2021, the U.S. direct investment in India was around $45 billion. As concern mounts over China’s outsize role in global supply chains, American companies have begun to seek manufacturing hubs outside that country. J. P. Morgan estimates that by 2025, Apple may make roughly 25 percent of its iPhones in India. The U.S. Embassy will need to provide support to American companies trying to enter India."

At least 39 people died. The world took notice. Mexican authorities launched a criminal investigation.

But that event gave strange new life-forms the opportunity to evolve, including a small sea-dwelling reptile that filter-fed much as bowheads and other baleen whales do today. The discovery was reported on Monday in the journal BMC Ecology and Evolution.

The reptile in question, Hupehsuchus nanchangensis, arrived on the scene a few million years after the Great Dying. Unlike the massive sea monsters that eventually evolved, it was about three feet long, including its tail. And unlike many of its relatives, Hupehsuchus had no teeth in its skinny snout.

In the decades since it was first discovered in 1972 in Hubei Province in southern China, scientists have puzzled over how Hupehsuchus might have been able to snag its meals. Cheng Long, a paleontologist at the Wuhan Center, China Geological Survey, has suspected for years that Hupehsuchus might have been a filter feeder, gulping mouthfuls of tiny zooplankton and straining out the seawater. However, soft tissues for filtering meals, comparable to the bristles that make up modern whales’ baleen, have not been found. Additionally, Hupehsuchus fossils tend to be preserved in flattened slabs. The angles and quality of preservation of the specimens’ skulls have made it difficult to identify similarities to the skulls of modern filter-feeding whales."

The intelligence portrays a battered Russian military that is struggling in its war in Ukraine and a military apparatus that is deeply compromised. The leaked material, from late February and early March, also shows daily real-time warnings to U.S. intelligence agencies on the timing of Moscow’s strikes — and even specific targets. Here’s what we know.

The documents show that the U.S. has been able to pass on crucial information to Ukraine, which the reports reveal is in dire straits. But the leak has the potential to do real damage to Ukraine’s war effort. Exposing which Russian agencies the U.S. knows the most about could give Moscow the opportunity to cut off the sources of information.

The leak has also complicated relations with allied countries and raised doubts about the U.S.’s ability to keep secrets. Publicizing eavesdropping on allies always hampers relations with key partners — like South Korea, whose help is needed to supply Ukraine with weaponry — and could curb intelligence sharing."

I’m Ezra Klein. This is “The Ezra Klein Show.”

roge karma

Hey, everyone. As you’ll notice, there’s a different voice behind the microphone today. For those of you who don’t know me, my name is Rogé, and I am the senior editor for “The Ezra Klein Show.” Ezra is out this week for a well-deserved vacation, so he asked me to step in and host an episode in his place. We’ve been doing a lot of shows recently on the current economic situation, but I wanted to make some space at the beginning of this year for a conversation that takes a step back and really tries to understand the deeper foundations of the economy we have. As background, one of the most basic rules of economics is that output is a product of capital and labor. Labor is the one we’re often more familiar with. It’s people and the work they do. But if you’re interested in wealth creation, then capital is really where the action is. Capital can be a whole range of things — a piece of land, a machine or a factory, a share of a company. It’s the stuff you need to produce any kind of economic value. And for that reason, economists generally agree that capital is the foundation of a society’s wealth. And that’s what brings me to today’s guest. Katharina Pistor is a professor of comparative law and the director of the Center on Global Legal Transformation at Columbia University. And her most recent book, which is called “The Code of Capital,” completely reimagines how we think about this base layer of our economy. Pistor’s argument is that capital doesn’t just exist out in the world for us to use. It’s something that we actively construct through the tools of law. And so for Pistor, economic value isn’t just captured by markets. It’s actively created by the legal system. And that’s where things get really interesting because it means that our current economy is built on top of what Pistor calls a feudal calculus. She shows how the same legal tools developed hundreds of years ago in England to protect the rights of landlords over commoners have been applied to more and more kinds of assets over time, to the point where they now undergird our entire economic system in ways that are often invisible to most of us, even as they shape so much of our lives. So we begin this conversation where Pistor begins — with land. But we end up covering the law’s role in everything from corporations to the financial system to climate change and more. One warning before we begin. This conversation can get a bit heady at times, and that’s not an accident. The systems we’re talking about here are often intentionally designed to be complex and opaque. But stick with it. I got a lot out of this conversation, and I think you will, too. Katharina Pistor, welcome to “The Ezra Klein Show.”

katharina pistor

Thank you very much for having me.

roge karma

So your book begins with a pretty fundamental redefinition of what economists refer to as capital. I think that’s the best place to start. What is capital, in your view? And how does it differ from the classic economist definition?

katharina pistor

Yeah. So classically, we define capital as one of the two factors of production. We have capital, and we have labor. And both combine to produce some goods that are then sold on market. So that’s the simple story. And I’m basically stepping back a little bit and say, well, how can some actors control stuff and decide what goes onto the production process? So they must own something, so that’s where property rights come in. So you already have, basically, a legal precondition, a right to something, that has to define capital. Now, the second question is, what distinguishes capital from other stuff? There’s a lot of stuff around. That can be land. That can be plows. That can be cars. That can be a machine. So what is capital here? Is it just any object out there? And I’m basically arguing that capital is an asset that has certain types of qualities or attributes. And these attributes allow the holders of these assets to generate wealth over time or to protect wealth that they have already produced in the past. And I offer four attributes of capital, which I then also link to specific types of legal institutions that help create capital assets. And the four attributes are priority, which means that if there are competing claims to the same stuff, some have better rights than others. And so the law ranks rights and claims to certain types of assets. So having priority gives you a head start over everybody else. The second is durability. Durability is a legal technique to protect assets against too many different claimants. You don’t want to have too many creditors trying to get at your stuff. So if you can use the law to separate some of your stuff out so that your personal creditors can’t get it, or your tax creditors can’t get it, then you might have a better chance at incubating wealth over time than if you didn’t have that opportunity. So priority, durability. The third is convertibility, and convertibility is really the way in which financial assets attain something like durability. It’s not just that you can trade financial assets or assign them, but that you have an option to convert them into something safer when things get a little rough. So ideally, you want to have an option to convert your privately-issued, privately-made assets into state money in times of crisis because state money is safer. And then you hold on to that. And once the crisis subsides, you can again invest in the future. So convertibility allows you, in fact, to lock in past gains by converting them into something boring, but safe. And then you go back into the more profitable assets once the crisis is over. And then last but not least, that’s really where the state really comes in, is universality. That’s the fourth attribute, which says that all these legal techniques that we use to create priority, convertibility and durability, all these claims will be enforced by the state against the world. The key is really that it’s not only that you have a contractual claim with somebody else in a bilateral relationship, but that you can count on the state helping you to protect these rights against anybody who may not have been at the table when we cut the deal and may not even know that I have better title. But if I pull out the document that says I have better title, I get my priority right.

roge karma

So we’re going to explore that answer and more full throughout this conversation because there’s so much complexity built within it. But let’s talk through, to ground this a little bit, an example of how that process happens, how an ordinary thing is turned into capital. And I want to start with the most basic, which is, how does the law turn a piece of land into capital?

katharina pistor

Yes, so land and property rights are very often conflated. Everybody thinks that when you talk about land that, yes, of course, somebody owns it. But just go back a little bit in history and think about all the open fields that had not been allocated to specific owners. That has been true in Europe and many other parts of the world and of course also in North America, right? Before the settlers came, this was open space. Many people used it. Animals used it, and of course, Indigenous people used the land. But land is just basically a piece of dirt. You can make use of it, but it’s just out there. And plants grow, and animals use it. And you can maybe harvest some fruit and produce from it, et cetera. Now, when we want to monetize the land, then we need something else. We need to allocate the right to use the land and to exclude others from that land so that the owner can reap the benefits from his or her own investments in the land. So the enclosure movement in England, which started already in the 16th century, if not earlier, and took about 200 years to exclude the commoners as a matter of right from the land. Many still were out there and plowing the land and doing their work, but they didn’t own the land anymore. It just gave title to the landlords. Prior to the enclosure movement, there was no clear titling system. In fact, England established a register for land to really look up the titles only in the 1920s. But in the 16th and 17th centuries, courts mostly decided in disputes between landlords and commoners that the landlords had the better rights, that they had priority. So once you allocate priority, somebody can say it’s mine. It’s not yours. I can exclude you. I will not allow you to graze your cattle. I will use this now to grow cash crops for the cities. Or I want to graze, actually, sheep, so I can take the wool and bring it into the textile factories. And I get the returns, and I will not share them with you. So turning land into capital requires a process of legal titling, of recognizing priority rights to the land and vesting these rights with some agent and then the state saying, and I will back that. If you now go onto the land, it’s trespassing, and you will be prosecuted.

roge karma

So my initial response to hearing that is isn’t land inherently valuable? I mean, as you were saying, property rights are a fairly recent invention. But land has been providing food and shelter and resources for humanity for the entirety of our history. And so I think the question is, what does the law actually add here? And I think it gets to the word you just used, which is “monetization.” So can you talk about how the law enables someone to monetize land? Like when we say they have these priority rights, they have this ability to use the land to create economic value, what exactly are we saying?

katharina pistor

So many objects have intrinsic value. We might also value them because we’re burying our ancestors there. That’s also another function of land. So land has a lot of value for many people. But for capitalism, the key is always money, making money out of the assets that you have. And so the legal coding is about ensuring that some can make money off it, and excluding others from getting their share of that money, right? So what the law really does, it allows some, as I said, to exercise priority rights over the land. And then the next step, of course, is, well, actually, now we can even get more money by, for example, either selling the land — I can alienate it now. So as long as we have commons, nobody alienates the land. That’s not what you do. You just all share the use of the land, and you have to make sure that you have some rules in place so that nobody overuses the land. But these mechanisms existed and still exist in many communities today. But if you want to really make profit from the land, you have to be able to sell it. You have to be able to mortgage it. So that’s not selling the land outright, but giving somebody else a right to take the land away from you if you can’t pay back the loan that you got. A mortgage allows you to get more cash in your hands right now, and say, am I going to take this and go into commerce and make money by trading internationally or domestically, or I’m building a factory with that money, and I offer the land as a mortgage. You can’t do this unless you have title to the land, and whoever, the creditor that gives you the money, can make sure that they can put their hands on that land or on your house if you are unable to pay your loan.

roge karma

So if you talk to any economist, there are a host of factors that they argue are really fundamental to wealth creation and distribution. So on the wealth creation side, if you look at an agricultural economy versus an industrialized economy versus a service-based economy, those are all very different for a lot of reasons that have very little to do with law, right? It has more to do with technology, with labor force, skills and education. And you can also say that that’s true on the distribution side, right? Thomas Piketty in his most recent book makes a very convincing argument that the so-called great compression of wealth in Western democracies during the 20th century was a product of the rise of progressive taxation and the welfare state. So in this broader story of wealth creation, of wealth redistribution, where does this process of coding capital fit in? How does it relate to these other factors, and what about it is distinct?

katharina pistor

The real distinction is between whether we are talking about redistribution at the back end or the creation of wealth at the front end. And I’m interested in the front end. I want to show first how wealth is being created, and then also think about whether the typical policy advice, like taxation, is actually an effective tool to deal with the wealth creation at the front end. So economists, because they believe that ultimately it’s the markets and better skills and better know-how and better resource management is what produces wealth, they are less concerned with predistribution. And I’m basically saying the creation of wealth itself is already a process by which some harness the legal system, which is actually not a private good but a social resource, to produce their private wealth. So what they creating already has basically the D.N.A. of a social structure built into that. And I really like to think about the coding of capital as the code being something akin to the D.N.A., the genetic code, or akin to a software code. That’s really how the stuff is made. The law is the source from which capital is cut. If you understand this, then you have to say, OK, at the back end, we want to do some redistribution. I’m all for redistribution also, especially given the amount of inequality we have today. But unless we think about the creation of wealth and how inequality is being created — through law, in my argument — we will never get ahead of the game. We might do some redistribution now, as we’ve done in the golden age of the 1960s, ‘70s, when the state actually did tax. And then taxation will be pushed back again, and inequality will come back. And we haven’t still figured out how to really deal with the inequality at the front end. So I’m basically saying, let’s just start looking at how wealth is created, and then we can decide what policy tools do we want to use to minimize inequality or at least keep some check on it and whether redistribution is the best means to achieve that.

roge karma

I think that’s a really helpful distinction. So let’s talk about what that structure, that D.N.A., actually looks like. We’ve already spoken a bit about land and property rights, but give me a sense of the range of legal structures we’re talking about here and how those structures help create wealth.

katharina pistor

So I basically call the means by which we turn simple assets into capital assets modules. So I talked already about the attributes that law confers on assets, but the way it’s done, we need some legal institutions. We basically need property rights. We need collateral on mortgages. We need some contract law. On top of that, we very often also use the common law trust or corporate law and, to some extent, other areas of the law, such as bankruptcy, can be used as well. But what is really interesting, when you look at the creation of capital from, starting with land, all the way today to the most complex financial assets, when you look at the legal D.N.A., it’s all the same stuff. So you said before, agricultural economies are different from service economies are different from industrial economies, postindustrial economies, et cetera. Yes, that’s true. That’s the outer appearance of these systems. But when you look at the making of the D.N.A., the structures that create wealth, it’s always the same stuff. It’s property rights, priority — that’s the attribute that you confer with it. It’s the use of corporate law, trust law, to create durability for some assets that you separate out from others. And you create, basically, a separate legal vessel that many people cannot penetrate to say these assets can incubate over time. So they create wealth, right? So that’s a durability. Or you give some an option to convert their assets into safe money when the sailing gets rough. And on the back end of it, the state says whatever you do, however you code capital with the legal toolset that you have, I will lend you the coercive powers of the state. And you can go to court and enforce your claims, and we can call in the bailiffs and the police if necessary to enforce these claims. Without that enforcement capacity, you wouldn’t be able to have large-scale markets. Why should I take any empty promise from a person I’ve never met at the other end of the world, working in a different time zone that he or she will actually live up to the commitments, to the promise to pay in the future? I want to have enforceable rights. Otherwise, I’m not trading. And so these are the things that we never make explicit when we talk about the system that we have, is how we create these commitment devices that economists like to talk about, but they don’t look into the legal structures that really create them. And what I’m trying to do is to dissect. I’m just always thinking like it’s an institutional autopsy. I’m going inside these assets and looking at the legal structures. I’m trying to bring them to the fore for people to understand how this stuff is really made.

So I want to talk about one of the stories that you mentioned there and that you trace throughout the book, which is you argue that these same basic mechanisms that were first used to turn land into capital have over time been applied to more and more kinds of assets, oftentimes increasingly abstract assets and that that process has really given us the economy we have today. And we’re going to dig into some of the specific pieces of that. But can you just walk me through that story at a high level?

katharina pistor

Yes. So we started off with land because land actually was the most important source of wealth in the industrialized countries until the very end of the 19th century, sometimes even bleeding into the 20th century. So it all started with land. But even as land was turned into capital assets, as property rights were created, and it was mortgaged to raise credit, et cetera, already other assets were being turned into capital. For example, intellectual property rights. So with intellectual property rights, I think it should be self-evident that even the stuff itself, the asset itself, is actually a creature of the law. There is no intellectual property right unless we say we recognize a certain invention as patentable. And then you have to patent it. Otherwise, you can’t tell others you can’t use this. I was first, and I now have a monopoly for the next 20 years or so to use this invention. So intellectual property rights have to be created. Patents, copyrights, trademarks are legal inventions. Financial assets as well are intangible. They are creatures of the law. Every financial asset is an I.O.U. An enforceable I.O.U., if it shall have value. So it’s a contract. And then we dress it up with collateral, and we turn what used to be a contractual claim for future payment, we treat it as if it was an asset, as if it was a property right. And with these additional attributes, we’re creating something that is actually valuable in monetary terms — that you can sell for a lot of money, and you can reap the profits. I’m not really telling a story that is just a sequential story. First came land, and then came this, and then came that. I think there are a lot of parallels. You can go back to Venice in the 15th century, and you have the first statute that protects patents. So you get this relatively early on. Or Queen Elizabeth allocating monopoly rights to the inventors of certain new machines. So you get that in parallel to the enclosure movement of land. But the technique, once it was discovered that this is what you can do. You can take a law and you give people priority rights over everybody else. You allow them to separate assets. You create the first trading companies. Then people mimic this, and they use it for different assets. Capitalism is all about expansion, finding new resources. And the resources don’t have to be in nature. The beauty of the law is actually you can just make it up. And then you can make a lot more of this. And I think we shouldn’t be surprised that financial capitalism that caps the centuries-old evolution of capitalism — because you just make that through contracts, through legal techniques. And you have new capital assets that you try to market. There must be a demand for it, but without the attributes, there wouldn’t be a demand for it at all. And then you have another source for wealth creation.

roge karma

Yeah, and this really gets to a paradox or a contradiction that I think really exists throughout your work, which is this idea that the law is both really this sort of miracle, right? It’s allowed us, to your point, to, through these legal fictions, scale up society from the level of smaller tribes — these big, complex economies. But at the same time, these legal fictions are one, when it comes to the enclosure movement and the ethnic cleansing of Native Americans, are built on some really horrific injustices and also are responsible for a lot of the inequality we have today. So I just want to flag that I think that is a paradox that we’re going to come back to throughout this conversation. And I want to start with some specific examples of this. You mentioned I.P. law. You mentioned financial assets, and we’re going to get into those. But I actually want to begin with corporations. So tell me about limited liability. What is it, first of all? And what purpose did it originally serve? And maybe you can even start with the way that law creates corporations in the first place because that’s not always intuitive to people.

katharina pistor

Yeah. Just like with land, I said before, you can think of land as a piece of dirt, but it becomes a capital asset only once you add property rights. So for me, you always have to distinguish between the simple thing, the stuff that we can look at or think about, and then the legal coding. And the same is true with a firm. You can just run a little mom and pop shop, a little start-up with a couple of friends. And you don’t even have to go anywhere and register it. You just have your little firm. The law might treat you in a certain way if you do something for profit, but that’s another story. If, however, you want to create a separate legal entity that owns its own assets and contracts in its own name and can sue and be sued in its own name, then you need to be more. You can’t just invent this. It has to be recognized by the law, which means you have to at least register it. So when you think of a corporation, you have to think of a couple of things. First, you create a separate legal person. We call them legal persons. They are treated very often like natural persons, but they’re creatures of the law. They can’t exist outside the law. They are legal fictions, as you call it. But I think it’s just not that fictitious. We have lots of corporations that dominate our lives, so you really have to take them very seriously. But it’s an important fiction to say it’s separate from you. It’s separate from the founders. It’s separate from the owners. It’s separate from the management. Indeed, today, corporations typically have an infinite life span. They live much longer than any of us, any of their managers, any of their employees, any of their financial investors. That sort of gives them staying power. That’s durability, in my classification. So limited liability was the technique that was invented. And of course, investors wanted it. The state says, actually, if you comply with some basic ground rules, you can set up a corporation that is separate from you and gives you, as a default provision, limited liability, which means that if the company goes belly up, nobody can get to your personal assets. So you can say this is risk diversification. It also allows you to broaden access to capital because small households and small savers would never put their money into company if the creditors of the company could put their hands on their own personal assets. That’s too risky for them. So if you want to have many people just blindly putting their money into corporate sector, you have to give them limited liability. And by doing so, you’re basically giving the investors, the shareholders, a license to externalize the risk because they can invest in the company no matter what it does to others, but they can’t lose ever more than the money they put into the company. You can lose your money that you use to buy your share, but nobody can go after your own personal assets. And that sort of changes the game, of course, for firms and investments and risk taking in capitalist economies.

roge karma

I think something that really stands out from that answer is that when these mechanisms, like limited liability, are created — and you can say a similar thing about the corporate form itself — it sort of makes sense. Limited liability, as you’re talking about, incentivizes, at least in some cases or maybe at least originally, a healthy level of risk taking. Imagine how daunting it would be to start a business or be an early investor in one if you knew that if the business failed, you would lose your house. You could lose your car, your retirement savings. I mean, it’s hard to imagine a lot of people would want to do that unless you have this sort of legal tool. And so you can understand why it would actually be really important to get economies off the ground. But an argument you make in the book is that in recent decades, especially, limited liability has sort of morphed into a mechanism through which already wealthy shareholders can shift their losses on to other actors. So can you talk to me, and maybe you can talk through some specific examples of how limited liability is often used in that way, to sort of shift losses onto others?

katharina pistor

Yeah. So I think in general, this is already what this device is all about, right? I don’t have to face the losses, so somebody else has to. What this means, in fact, is that if the company goes belly-up, there will always be losers. The workers will lose their job, and especially the creditors who might have also put money into the company, they don’t get anything if the company has no assets left. Very often in a corporate bankruptcy, creditors get a couple of cents on the dollar that they had put into the company. And they can’t go back to the shareholders. It’s a redistribution of risk, in a way. You’re shifting it to the creditors just by the invention of limited liability. But then you can also start to become more adventurous, right? Especially once most legal systems allowed corporations to procreate. A corporation can create another corporation. So I’m a parent company. I just set a couple of subsidiaries or daughter companies. In the US, it was highly disputed throughout the 19th century. And only towards the end of the 19th century, did states allow, in their corporate laws, corporations to create other corporations. Once you do this, we say, well, this is great. I can now — I’m the parent company. I raise money on capital markets. That’s debt finance for me. But now I have cash on hand with which I can capitalize another entity, a limited liability company. I keep 100 percent of the stock. This company now has some assets. And then they use the assets to borrow against by raising, again, capital on markets. And the beauty is if this subsidiary goes under, well, I have a legal shield between me and the subsidiary because the subsidiary is another independent legal person. And the creditors of that independent legal person can come back and try to get my assets. The example that I used in the book to make this visible is Lehman Brothers. The beauty of a bankruptcy — and of course, Lehman went under in 2008. The beauty of a bankruptcy is that all of a sudden, we can look inside, right? We get all the documentation from the bankruptcy receiver, all the details that might have been difficult to assemble while the company was still in motion. We get this once you have it on the autopsy table in your dissection room. And if you look at Lehman, when it failed, it had hundreds, if not thousands, of different legal entities. For sure, that could be documented, over 200 separate legal entities, 60 of them alone in Delaware, where the parent company was incorporated as well. 30 or so in the UK. Another 34 in the Cayman Islands. Some in France, Germany, Japan. So hundreds of these subsidiaries. And so you have to ask yourself, why do they use that? And it’s not because they have to create separate subsidiaries in different jurisdictions. They want to. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have 60 in a single jurisdiction. And I think the logic behind that is that they use the technique I just described. They’re basically saying, we can probably raise more debt finance as a group if we separate it out between different entities and play a couple of additional tricks. So one thing they did, and that is a risky exercise, but they did it, and maybe also it’s one of the reasons why the company failed. They said, OK, we create a parent company. Then we have all these other family members, these children that we create, the subsidiaries. They all go out and raise funds for their specific investment project, for their specific new financial asset or activity that they want to conduct. Meanwhile, the shareholders of the parent companies, the ultimate investors at the top of the entire group, they’re getting every penny of profit that the group generates. They’re getting this paid out in either in the form of dividends, or they just engage in repurchase programs of shares. So companies have done this for a long time, financial intermediaries even for longer, that they repurchase their own stock, which is a way to give their shareholders their money back. And then the shareholders can decide whether they want to rebuy shares in this company, or go somewhere else. The shareholders at the top, they, of course, benefit from limited liability. They get all the cash that comes in. They will not be exposed to any losses if anything fails. And now you get the change in the market conditions in the housing markets and global financial markets. And all of a sudden, one subsidiary starts to get a little wobbly, and another get a little wobbly. And creditors of these subsidiaries are saying, OK, where do I get my money? That subsidiary will not pay, so let me go to the parent. What are the assets the parent has? Well, its shares on the subsidiaries. And so you see, at the end of the day, you have a house of cards which created enormous amounts of profits for shareholders. Over time, they took out millions, if not billions of dollars. But when push came to shove, when you look to bankruptcy, not all that much was left at the end of the day. But looking at the structure, I think you can also see why not that much had been left at the end of the day.

roge karma

I find this example to be just infuriating. To put some numbers to this, you point out in the book that in the time period from when the housing market began its downturn in 2006 until its collapse in 2008, Lehman Brothers paid $631 million to its shareholders. And that was the low end. Wells Fargo paid $10 billion. JPMorgan, $11 billion. Citigroup, close to $16 billion. And when you think about the incentive system at work here, it’s just shocking, right? All of this money is being paid out at the same time that the economy is beginning to fall apart in a serious way. And so at the same time these banks most need to be building up a financial cushion to absorb potential losses, they are doing the opposite. And I think that’s such an important point for understanding why 2008 got as bad as it did. You hear all the time in the context of that crisis about the banks being, quote, unquote, too big to fail, as if it was some inevitability. But it seems like one reason they were so overleveraged in the first place is because of this bizarre incentive system you just described. And so I guess my question is, when the financial crisis did hit, what actually happened to that money? And who ended up paying the bill at the end of the day when many of those banks either plummeted or outright collapsed?

katharina pistor

I mean, the money that you just mentioned was, of course, paid out to the shareholders, which are investors. These can be pension funds. These can be other institutional investors, and maybe also some private investors. But this is a whole range of investors. They, of course, cashed the money. They probably reinvested it into other ventures. So that money is basically being circulated in the economy. Now the problem is if the entire market starts wobbling, policymakers face a stark choice. Many economists and some more libertarian politicians also were saying at the time, let the market just crash. They need to learn their lesson, and we’ll just have to go through this. And the market will allocate the losses where it falls. That’s, of course, a proposition that risks tanking the entire financial system, which is the nervous system of our entire economy. So if the financial system collapses, you won’t be able to pay your employers the next day. Most people won’t have access to their own savings easily. There might be runs not only on asset markets, as we have seen. There might also be more runs on banks. There were a couple of major bank runs in the UK and other countries, even if they were not physical bank runs in this country, where they were runs on assets. Now, if policymakers say, we’ll just allow for a self-correction of markets, this risks basically a major collapse of the financial system and the economic system on a scale that we’ve seen last here in the Great Depression in the United States, or in other countries, like in my own home country, in Germany, it was one of the causes for fascism to rise. So it’s also a politically risky proposition to allow the economy to tank. And so what do you do if you don’t want to allow it to tank? You have to try to stabilize the economy, and so you’re throwing money at the system. What money? Now, state money. As I said before, state money is safe because the state stands behind it and basically promises the future productivity of the country to say we stand behind that money. We issue it, and we give it. We give liquidity boosts to the core institutions and the system without which the system, as it currently stands, cannot operate. So they tend to rescue the system at the top, at the apex or the core of the system, because that’s where the real risk is that it might collapse. They’re basically throwing money at the same institutions that created the risk in the first place, that caused the financial collapse. But they almost don’t have a choice. One can debate, of course, whether they could have saved the homeowners, and then indirectly, through them, the banks. But what they did, they just threw the money at the banks, and at other critical institutions, such as A.I.G. Many people will remember the A.I.G. bailout that followed after Lehman Brothers collapsed. And in this way, I think it becomes visible how central the state is for maintaining the kind of financial system we have today because without that backstopping function, it would have very likely collapsed. [MUSIC PLAYING]

roge karma

I want to talk about a related example here, which is the way that the same legal tools that were originally used to turn land into capital that we’ve been talking about creating legal persons in the form of corporations, how those same tools have been used more recently to turn debt itself into capital. Can you sort of walk me through how that happened?

katharina pistor

Yeah. I mean, a debt claim is when you start with just a simple premise by the data to the creditor to make a payment in the future. So for the creditor, it could just be a relationship of trust. I give you some money. You promise me to pay back, and that’s it. But for the creditor, again, to make money with this, the promise of the debtor has to be tradable because then they can cash it in now. They can sell it, and so they can have their own liquidity to invest again in other things. And the entire business of banking is based on the idea that we can give credit and basically create debt for some and make money on that. And so our entire financial system is a system that has created legal devices to basically dislodge financial relations from the basic interpersonal trust relation to give them the legal backing so that lots of people take promises and start doing other things with them. So on the basis of that promised money, you make your own investments. It’s a house of cards, if you want, but it works as long as most people believe that most people will eventually pay back their loans. And as long as that is true, the financial system remains stable. Once this is no longer true, then it becomes a very risky proposition.

roge karma

So let’s walk through an example here, the mortgage-backed security. You call the mortgage-backed security, quote, “the quintessential legal steroid,” end quote. So first of all, what is a mortgage-backed security, at a high level, and how does the law construct them?

katharina pistor

So a mortgage — start with this. Before we securitize it, a mortgage is basically the offering of an additional asset to back the promise to repay. So I buy a house. I don’t have enough cash on hand to pay the price. I need a loan. The bank gives me a loan, or a broker organizes a loan for me if I offer the house as collateral, as I give them a mortgage, right? So that’s the simple story. Now in the past, until the 1970s, early 1970s, in this country and many other countries as well, most banks would basically lend to local homeowners, and then they would sit on these mortgages for up to 30 years and hoping that the homeowner will actually pay month by month the money that is owed, which is basically the principal plus interest. And if he doesn’t pay, then we go and evict and seize the house. That’s the mechanism. Now, the idea was born, and that was actually a political idea. That were sort of private law creations prior to that, but it was a decision by Congress to say in the late 1960s, why don’t we allow the big mortgage companies — Fannie Mae, in particular, which was the government-owned company first, later privatized by the government-sponsored company. Why don’t we allow them to start securitizing mortgages because it allows us to broaden the creditor base, and it will bring down the cost of credit. and so more people can buy houses, which is a great idea, right? So you’re basically saying, OK, the private banks, the private brokers originate mortgages as before. They give a loan. They take a collateral in return. And then they do this over and over and over again. They take an entire package of loans backed by mortgages, and they sell the whole stuff to Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae, one of the government-sponsored or government-owned entities. And then they securitize it. So they just pack it up. And what do they do, is they throw it behind the veil of a trust, which is basically creating a separate legal asset pool, and then sell interest in this asset pool to investors. So now these investors don’t own a specific mortgage or the cash flow that comes from the loan backed by a mortgage, but they own a cross section of the entire pool. And in the beginning, this is what it was, was basically a cross section of the entire pool in a particular trust structure that had all these securitized mortgages in them. So the securitization basically means you are flipping a claim to future pay into a financial asset that you can trade. So you’re selling these interests in the pool to different investors, who can also resell them if they want. So they can always diversify their portfolio or reconfigure it as they please, and so many more investors will join the market. That was the original model, and I think it was a very good model. Now then, this model, of course, morphed as well because at some point, the government also felt that maybe the private sector can take over securitization. So you started having collaborative securitization projects, and eventually the private sector took over. But then they also took the system for a ride. They basically said, this is ingenious, right? You basically take promises to future pay any kind of receivables, you package them up behind a trust structure, and you can just — a trust you can just easily create. It doesn’t even — the governance structure just needs a trustee to make some decisions on behalf of the beneficiaries, which are the investors. And you can thereby always get cheaper credit because so many more investors will jump at that because it’s just a portion of the risk that they take. And so they will give you money, and you can just blow up the entire system. And so if you look at the modules of the code of capital that I mentioned before, you need property rights. You need trust. You need corporate law. You need collateral law. You need contract law. You have all of that built up into these systems. A mortgage is, of course, based on property rights and collateral law. For securitization, you need trust because you separate the mortgages and the loans of a certain pool of homeowners into one vehicle, and then you sell interest into that vehicle to all kinds of different investors. And then on top of that, the legislature also created both tax incentives and priority rules in bankruptcy that made it even more attractive for investors to go into these kind of securitized loans rather than into direct loans that didn’t have similar benefits. So you’re basically creating a legal structure that makes it apparently less risky to be in these kind of assets, rather than anything else. The problem is if you overdo it, if everybody just then starts humming out more and more securitized mortgages. The question is, what is the quality of the houses? What is the quality of the borrowers? Can they actually really pay back? And as you know, many books have been written about this, about the mortgage crisis. The brokers that originated the loans were no longer looking at whether people had actually a job, were able to pay their loans. But didn’t matter because you just generate the fees. You create these new structures. There are investors who want to buy it. It’s all fine. Until it’s no longer fine because people realize that actually, the cash flow is not coming. And then everybody’s starting to say, OK, where are my rights? What rights do I have? Can I actually seize the house? Can I get cash flow from this house to put it back into the structures and pay it to the investors? And if investors are feeling, actually, this is no longer working, they’re going to sell. Let’s exit. And if too many exit, you just drive down the price of these assets.

roge karma

And so in a way, would it be fair to say that part of what these legal coding devices, like the mortgage-backed security or at least how it’s used today, part of what these devices are doing, it’s not necessarily guaranteeing convertibility, it’s giving the illusion of convertibility. It’s creating sort of what you can think of as a liquidity illusion. These legal structures, the mortgage-backed securities, the C.D.O.s that were built out of them, it seems like what you’re describing is that they promise a level of stability, a level of convertibility, an ability to cash out that they can’t ultimately keep — that at the end of the day, there’s no guarantee you can cash out, but these structures are dressed up to make it seem like if you can. And because these assets appear way safer than they are, that causes more money to enter the system than it can handle, and you get a bubble. Is that a fair way of describing it?

katharina pistor

Yes, that’s exactly right. I fully agree.

roge karma

And so I think this brings us to one of the central arguments of the book, which is we can sit here and rehash the 2008 financial crisis all day. But what I think you’re offering here is actually a much broader theory of financial crises, a almost legal theory of financial crises. Could you just talk me through your theory of how and why financial crises happen?

katharina pistor

Yes, and I actually did publish a paper, which is called “A Legal Theory of Finance,” which was in response to the global financial crisis of 2008, because I had the very strong feeling during the crisis and afterwards is that nobody really had a good theory on offer of how the financial system works, why it crashed. And I don’t think anybody can predict when it will crash, but just at having a coherent explanation for both — how it expands and why it’s so frequently crashed or becomes highly unstable. My feeling was that neither modern finance theory nor many sociological accounts could really give us a full picture. And the legal theory of finance was really a product of a collaborative research project with sociologists and political scientists and economists and some lawyers as well. And the lessons that I got from this research project where we looked into different types of financial markets in the decade running up to the global financial crisis and said, let’s just dissect what happened. Let’s look at existing theories and see what they explain and when the explanation collapses and then let’s try to learn from that. That’s how I basically tried to — what I learned, myself, in the end, how important the role of law is. And when I look at the financial system, I’m basically saying, it’s deeply legally structured, which others have said as well. It’s just maybe a little bit more fine-tuned in the way that I say it. So you can’t have scaled, highly scaled financial system without the law. You can have local promises among people who know each other. We know of, in the Middle Ages, you had trade in the Mediterranean, but it was held together by a group of ethnically homogeneous middlemen. And the scope of the financial market was limited by that network. If you didn’t have clan members of these middlemen somewhere in a port at the edge of the Mediterranean, you wouldn’t trade there because you had to rely on these middlemen. Now, the beauty of the law, when you basically create authority of the law backed by state power, you can actually create a global financial system, as long as you create the contractual and property rights devices such that claims will be enforceable not only in a single court of law, maybe actually in multiple courts of law. But you create this additional backstopping mechanism. So to have national markets, especially financial markets, to have global financial markets, you need the law to scale it. The problem is that once you have created all these credible commitments, and they’re credible because they’re, in principle, legally enforceable, you dress them up with collateral. You say, I have a really, really good asset and nothing can happen because it’s not only the promise. It’s also the asset that backs it. But at the end of the day, if everybody tries to enforce their rights at the same time, then the system necessarily collapses because it always creates more promises than it can keep. That’s the very idea of credit. I’m saying you get this in the future, once I get my return. I’m making a promise on the future, hoping that the future will turn out better than the present currently is. Even if everything else just stays the same, we’re trying to enforce all the rights at the same time. The system must collapse. That’s the very source of the system is promises that are, in part, empty. And when you get changes in circumstances, such as changes in housing markets, changes in the volatility of financial markets and the stability of financial intermediaries, then everybody will start looking a little closer. And so the law and finance paradox basically says you need law to build financial markets, but the law will also destroy financial markets because if you actually enforce all these commitments, you will self-destroy the system because there is not enough — there are not enough assets to back all the promises that you made. Now at this point, you have to step out of the legal system to avoid the crisis. And that’s basically, you go offline. If you want, you offer support to the financial system, whereas there’s actually no legal claim — there’s no right to have this liquidity. It’s at the discretion of the central bank or the treasury or other policy, institutions, to say we actually put liquidity where no liquidity was owed into the system to stabilize the system as such. And now you have the question, actually, can we go back to the status quo ante? Can we go back to the beginning? Actually, law is such a great credible commitment device because now you know that actually, if you enforce all legal commitments, then we need actually a backstopping mechanism. Without it, it doesn’t work. And I think we have reached a stage in financial market development where most sophisticated players know, of course, that the system is inherently volatile and will collapse if all promises were enforced at the same time. You just go for another ride. You’re trying to safeguard your claims a little bit better than what your competitors might be able to do. In the last instance, you just have to pray that the Fed will step in if things go wrong.

roge karma

And that really connects something for me about your work because another way of telling the story of increased financial risk-taking over the past few decades is that it was precipitated not by law, but by the Fed’s conditioning of markets. So in 2008, there was a belief that the banks were too big to fail, that if everything collapsed, the Fed would have to bail them out. And partly as a result, it did. But what you’re saying is that part of the reason the system was too big to fail in the first place, that the Fed had to step in and condition markets in this way, was because of the way that law has constructed a system that is overleveraged, that invites more risk-taking, that is this house of cards that could easily collapse on itself. I’m just wondering if that’s correct, and how you think about how those — if that’s how you think about how those two stories interact.

katharina pistor

Yes, I think there is clearly an interaction because I think the more the market understands that the Fed will have to step in, the greater the risks will be that the markets will take. But blaming the Fed or any central bank for that, I think puts the cart before the horse, because you have to think about first how the risk in the system is being built up. I think, again, it’s like we talked about earlier about what is predistribution and redistribution? Where does this all come from? And I want to first understand the sources of the instability, the inherent instability of finance, and then think about what is the role of a central bank in the system? And what I would argue is that we’ve actually used the legal tools not only to make sophisticated banking or make banking more sophisticated over the last couple of decades. Remember that an entire shadow banking system was created in that period, which even today rivals the regulated banking system. So when credit markets first demonstrated that they can destabilize the entire financial system, countries — England, the United States, many other countries — started to regulate banks. And they thought, OK, now we regulate banks. Now the system is safe. And of course, competitive markets will try to find avenues where they can do the same stuff that banks do in ways that they will not face the cost of regulation. So they engage in regulatory and legal arbitrage, and shadow banking is that system. And the system of mortgage-backed securities that I described earlier is part of the shadow banking system. You have to add a couple of additional elements to it. So you have these assets, mortgage-backed securities or other securitized assets. You have intermediaries that originate them. You have intermediaries that manage them. You have some investors who buy them, like our pension funds. You have money market funds that offer liquidity to them in good times. So we have an entire ecology of new institutions that’s come out, and they do functionally exactly what banks do, but they were not regulated as banks. Now, as long as you allow this to morph, and I think Congress can be blamed to some extent. Also, the Fed and the regulators can be blamed to allow the system to morph and to scale up. When then a financial crisis appears, as it must at some point because you’re making promises on a future with the expectation that the future will always look better than the present. And that is just not going to happen. So at some point, the system will start to unravel, and then the question is yeah, can we allow it to crash? If it is too big, the political, social, economic cost of allowing it to crash can be enormous and are unpredictable. It’s at this moment that I think it’s very hard to argue that the Fed or other central banks that had the capacity to try to rescue the system shouldn’t have done that. It’s the build-up of the system, the inability to control — the unwillingness to control the build-up because we’re saying, oh, that’s the market. Everything the markets are doing is just fine. That, I think, prevents us from trying to monitor what’s going on and maybe intervening earlier, before the build-up is too big for not intervening.

roge karma

I think one of the possibly frightening questions that raises is whether we’re in one of those build-ups or one of those crashes right now. A lot of economists and economic historians have been talking about the way that we’re living through this moment of particular financial fragility. We’ve had a couple of them on the show. People can listen to our episodes with Adam Tooze and Mohamed El-Erian. The point that they’ve been making is that our financial system has been built on top of an assumption of low interest rates, of cheap debt financing, of quantitative easing for a while now. And now that that’s being taken away, it’s going to create breakages in the system. It’s going to reveal some of these cracks in the system, as we saw with the U.K. gilt markets a few months ago. So I’m just wondering, as someone who has studied these systems closely, do you think we’re in one of those pre-2008 moments right now? And are there any parts of the economy or financial markets that you’re particularly worried about?

katharina pistor

I do think that we are in a moment where things become relatively volatile, dangerous and to some extent unpredictable. I think the one thing that one could predict is that it’s crisis-prone. And the reason is I think the build-up of leverage in the system, which I think has been sort of controlled with the banks, at least the official story. Although recent news reports have suggested that banks have reached similar leverage levels that they had last before the 2008 crisis, so that’s not a good sign. On top of that, we’ve seen many of the practices for creating the mortgage-backed securities markets, for creating shadow banking, we have seen many of these practices also morph to the nonfinancial sector. So we’re using similar techniques to find debt finance for large corporations that are in trouble. And you’re just building exactly the same kind of mechanisms that I described earlier for Lehman Brothers so that many of the ordinary corporations in this country are also levered up. They might not be as systemically volatile as financial intermediaries, but it’s important to keep this in mind because they might be affected, just as the car companies had been in 2008. There might be more other nonfinancial companies that might be affected. So I think building up of leverage in the economy is always a sign of potential trouble in the future, especially when you can’t locate it very easily. And when many different entities are involved in the production of credit might be exposed to the risks that will unfold, then it’s basically a question of time. I don’t think you can predict exactly when it’s going to happen, necessarily not where exactly it’s going to happen. You can pinpoint some of the most volatile sectors. And mostly I think it will always be a relatively small entity on the periphery of the system that is cut off all of a sudden from refinancing, and then the risk will spread because more and more will then look a little closer at what’s going to happen. And the system then builds typically from the periphery to the core. So I think we are in a moment that we have to watch closely, and I think the central banks right now are in a bind because on the one hand, they’re trying to control inflation and trying to raise interest rates. On the other hand, by raising interest rates, they will have an effect on the financial system that has been built around low interest rates, as you suggest, that is largely unpredictable.

So far, we’ve mainly been discussing the way these legal coding devices have been applied to different assets over time. But another trend you track in the book is the way that, as our economy has globalized, corporations have increasingly been able to functionally choose which country’s domestic law that they want to follow. And for me, one of the most unsettling but also revealing examples of what incentives begin to take shape when this happens is the Rascals program operating out of Lehman Brothers. So can you talk about what Rascals was and the purpose that it served?

katharina pistor

Yes. This is one of the little anecdotes that I like to tell because it gives you, I think, so much insight in how the system really operates and also maybe the mind-set of the people who are doing it. So Rascal stands for Regulation Administration of Safe Custody and Local Settlement. If you think about this, it doesn’t really translate easily into the acronym Rascal. So let me step back a little bit. Lehman Brothers, as I said before, it’s an American investment bank. It has hundreds of subsidiaries. One of its most important subsidiaries was one of the entities working out of London, which did most of the trading in securities for the entire group. At some point, the European Union came in and decided that it had to make financial markets a little bit more stable by requiring all intermediaries, not just banks, but also investment banks like Lehman, to hold sufficient capital, equity capital, against lending, against basically being exposed to borrowers who might not be able to pay back in time. So that put the Lehman Brothers’ business model at risk because it became more expensive to do their job. Because they couldn’t now borrow or always basically raise debt finance on markets and then don’t use this for their trading and lending, et cetera, activities, but they always had to keep some back, if you wish. They had to make sure that there was enough equity backing of their activities. And so they thought, how can we lower the regulatory costs of these new measures? They can’t just wiggle out of this unless they want to get out of London, which of course they don’t want to because London is the hub where they want to be. So what did they do? They set up an entity in a jurisdiction that was not governed by the E.U. rules, Switzerland. Now they didn’t have to move to Zurich. They could just set up in London, in the same office, run by the same people, a separate legal entity that was governed by Swiss law. And Switzerland, of course, has access to E.U. markets, but it’s not regulated by the same regulatory principles. Now the key was to make sure that legally speaking, the exposure, the risk exposure that their E.U. regulation was trying to get, it would always rest with the Swiss entity, not with the London one. Because that way, you could basically get around the requirement to hold additional capital against this exposure. And so they set up this repurchase program. So repos is just a device to say, I sell you something, and you sell it back to me tomorrow at a higher price. So what they did, they set up an automated system that these repo transactions would never close. So you open a leg. You get the payment back. Immediately, you open another leg, and you shift the asset back to the Swiss entity so that the appearance was created that non-stop, the Swiss entity would have the exposure, not the London entity. And so you wouldn’t have to take the capital charges at the London entity. It was an automated system. The big irony was that after Lehman had filed for bankruptcy, and all the other Lehman entities also filed for bankruptcy, nobody had bothered to switch off the system. So it was still running until some employee, without asking, just switched it off. And then there were 50 million where there was a legal dispute. Who gets it? Who gets that money? Does it belong to the London entity, or to the Swiss entity? And of course, now both are in bankruptcy so that the creditors of these entities want to claw back the money wherever they can find it so they get anything back from the money they put into these entities. And so they fought. The receivers in bankruptcy fought over who should get this money. In the end, the London entity won for reasons I don’t find entirely persuasive, but that’s what the chancellor in England decided.

roge karma

This example is just so maddening, because earlier, when we were talking about these dynamics of financial crises, we were talking about what you would ideally want is for the state to step in with some form of regulation to be able to prevent these kinds of dynamics from building up in the system to the first place. And in many ways, that’s what the E.U. did, or at least tried to do. They tried to create these capital requirements. And instead of following them, Lehman was able to just completely circumvent them and keep going almost as if normal. And so I guess the question is, one, how is this legal? And two, if this is legal, if this is something that companies can just do, then what does that imply for the possibility of regulation in a globalized world?

katharina pistor

Yeah, I think these are really important questions. So is it legal? Well, that’s, of course, the artwork that lawyers have to provide. They have to make sure it’s legal. Otherwise, it doesn’t work, right? One of the lawyers I very often invite to coteach a class with me is sort of a leading partner in the city, and she describes to my students always that you have to think about the regulatory regime as the scaffolding. And in order to create a new asset that works, you have to find a gap within the scaffolding. Because if you hit one of the scaffolds, it’s void. You can’t enforce it. It doesn’t do any good for you. So you have to design something that is at least formally legal. And if it is challenged sometimes in the future, maybe somebody will say, well, it violates the purpose of the law. But that’s just down the line. We don’t even know whether anybody will ever be challenged. So I think what is important to understand here is we have actually two legal systems folded into one. We have a system of private law, which is designed to give private parties a lot of autonomy and flexibility to design their own legal arrangements, to take a contract and refashion it, to create a corporation and do things with it that help them advance their specific interests. It’s a highly malleable system, but it has the blanket guarantee that if you do this roughly within the parameters set by the law, and there are few mandatory rules in private law. It’s all dispositive. People can do a lot of stuff with that. It will be backed by the state. And then you have the regulatory system that comes in from time to time and says, actually maybe they’ve gone a little far. We have to put some stopgaps in here. And again, in a competitive system, people start thinking about, well, how can I get around that? Because I can be more competitive if I don’t have to basically face the cost of this new regulation. So they will hire lawyers, and they will try to get around it. And the more complex it becomes, the more complex the solutions have to be. And so this is also why lawyers actually make quite a bit of money to try to get around these rules. There was an entire team working on this, and the chancellor himself presiding over the case we just discussed was kind of perplexed that you would have a top investment bank and top lawyers basically creating something that is a scam. It’s not real. It’s just to try to get around the regulations. I’m saying this as a law professor. These are many of my former students who are doing this or students I will produce in the future, which, of course, creates also a bit of a dilemma for me because I’m part of a system that I’m criticizing. Let me just be frank about that. But they have the incentive structures in these firms to do this. The point I would make is that in a highly complex system, in a system that is deeply regulated by law, especially finance is also deeply regulated, much of the competition today is not about something outside the law. It’s the law itself. It’s basically using the law to get a head start over others by reducing regulatory costs, by creating somewhat stronger attributes for capital. So it’s basically playing with the rules of the game rather than just playing the game. That’s what the system has become. To some extent, it’s unpreventable because all the rules are necessarily incomplete. They are all somewhat open-ended, subject to interpretation. And if you start there, and you carve out a niche for your own client to make a head start over others, and everybody else follows, you can imagine how many different and also interesting, sometimes ingenious sort of devices you can create. But it makes it very hard for a regulator to regulate because, of course, regulation, too, is incomplete. And regulations are always partial. And if you can refashion something so that it looks a little different than what the regulator seemed to have regulated, you’re getting out. You’re wiggling out of the regulatory framework. And then lastly, as you suggest, globalization means that, well, I just, if necessary, shift my accounts from London to New York, right? If New York has easier rules, I’m not going to stay in London, or vice versa. to the extent that I can pick and choose my rules by simply re-incorporating elsewhere or shifting my accounts to a different jurisdiction, the less likely it is for any state to actually regulate effectively because it’s always a partial regulation and there’s always another option.

roge karma

I want to just hold on this point because I think it’s so important. And I want to go back to the actual quote from the judge who presided over the Rascals case because I think it’s extremely revealing. So the quote from this judge is, quote, it is at least at first sight counterintuitive to think that one of the largest and most sophisticated investment banking institutions in the world, staffed by some of the foremost experts in the business and advised by the most eminent law firms, should have spent more than a decade solemnly entering into countless thousands of mutual transactions which were either completely unnecessary, completely ineffective, or both. The suspension of disbelief called for by the parties’ primary cases has not been easy. Now first of all, I just think that is probably one of the best lines — paragraphs in a legal ruling ever. But I also think it’s a perfect encapsulation of what’s at stake here with what you’re talking about because in a capitalist system, this kind of thing isn’t supposed to happen. The entire social contract that underwrites capitalism, going back to Adam Smith and “The Wealth of Nations” is that the pursuit of individual interests should produce some kind of social benefit — that by trying to make yourself richer, you will ultimately make everyone else richer. And we may have to tolerate some inequality here and there, but ultimately we’ll all be better off. And I think Rascals and this process you’re describing, because Rascals is not the only version of this. This kind of regulatory and legal arbitrage is happening all the time. It completely undermines the social contract. And even beyond just arbitrage, this is something that we can, I think, apply to everything we’ve been talking about here. Shareholders using limited liability to squeeze as much profit out of a company as they can. Banks creating financial products that end up crashing the global economy. Earlier, you mentioned IP law, and we didn’t get to talk about it as much. But there, it’s companies using patents to sort of destroy competition over things like D.N.A. sequences that can hardly be considered innovations. And in all of these cases, it’s these actors pursuing their own interests at the expense of everyone else. And I think that just brings us to one of the most radical implications of your book, which is it really feels like we’ve built a legal structure in a way that we’ve seemingly broken or at least damaged the core mechanism by which capitalism is supposed to deliver for society. I’m just wondering how you think about that because that seems like a pretty profound change or implication, at least.

katharina pistor

So I agree with your analysis. Basically, what I always say, you use a social resource. The legal system, it works only because most people actually believe in the authority of the law. It’s also a system that allows you to scale relations, and the more you can use it in ways to create your own private wealth, the more, of course, also the interests are in using it exactly for this purpose and for not any other purpose for which it has been created. I also agree that actually, this has been turbocharged over time. And I think the regulatory competition amongst countries opening, basically, your borders for capital flows and recognizing the laws from different jurisdictions has given those who hold capital and their lawyers really a menu of options to pick and choose the law by which they wish to be governed. If everyone could just pick and choose the rules by which she wishes to be governed, we couldn’t have anything like a social contract. There wouldn’t be a social contract. We just pick and choose what we like best and then we make our money on that. And forget what everybody else has or may not have. And it’s certainly true that it has become worse. I would actually, however, argue that it has been at the very core of capitalism. That is what capitalism is all about. And you know, I think Adam Smith, when he talks about the invisible hand in his famous book, he has an entire section where he explains how the invisible hand works. Why is it that merchants who venture abroad will still nonetheless share something with their fellow citizens at home? Because inevitably, in Smith’s thought, the merchant will have to come home to repack, but also because at home, he knows his institutions. So you always come home because that’s where he knows the institutions. And I would say these are, of course, also the legal institutions. And by coming home and sharing some of the goods and his experience, et cetera, he will share with his fellow citizens. Now, we have created, through a host of different rules and regulations and choice of law rules, a global system where nobody has to come back home. You can stay in the Cayman Island and still, actually, you operate here in the U.S. That’s where you make the money. But legally, you might be in the Cayman Islands, or legally, you might be in London. So you pick and choose the laws that govern you, but without making a commitment, really, to the people with whom you share everything else around you. And of course, legal creatures are a separate story here, as well. So I think there is something that is innate to using the law in this way in capitalism. And I think there have been periods when states have been able to cabin the excesses of capitalism for a while. But when you look closer, even after major catastrophes, such as the Great Depression in the 1930s, World War II, and then the attempt after World War II to create a better global system and to stabilize domestic systems, again, through rules and regulations, it didn’t take all that long to unravel the safeguards. I mean, it starts already globally in the ‘50s and ‘60s to try to get around capital controls. Once the U.S. gets off the gold standard and capital controls are beginning to be removed, you know that’s when things become wild again. And we’re seeing the use of these mechanisms to create these competitive examples. And then within two decades later, we’re close to another major financial meltdown, which is prevented only by the central bank stepping in a major way. So there’s, I think, an inherent dynamic here, which we have to come to terms with, and I think legal arbitrage is at the very core. I don’t think that 400 years ago, people used it to the same extent, but I think the basic idea was there. And institutions like the trusts were born in the 12th century, the predecessor, to evade taxes. There’s always been, at the heart, was playing with the rules, getting away with something, and still pretending that actually what you do is legal. It’s having the — eating the cake and having it, too, right? You can basically reallocate property rights from the commoners to the landlords without being accused of theft because you can say it’s legal. And so I think it’s not that capitalism has been derailed, and we can just go back to its safer core. I think it’s an inherent mechanism of capitalism itself.

roge karma

I think that brings us, though, to what I’ve come to think about as quite possibly the core tension of your book and maybe one of the core tensions of capitalism itself, which is the way that this legal coding of capital is simultaneously a miracle and a curse. Because if you’re right that this cuts to the core of capitalism, well, capitalism has provided a lot of social wealth, a lot of material progress, a very sharp rise in living standards. And these coding mechanisms that we’ve talked about, these legal modules that we’ve talked about, have been really important to that, right? Property rights. One of the few things economists agree on is that property rights are central to economic growth. Limited liability incentivizes entrepreneurship, right? Patents help spur innovation. These debt instruments, at least in theory, expand access to credit that allows businesses to make more productive investments in the economy, that expands credit to people so that they can afford houses. And so I think there’s an argument to be made that maybe we’re being too negative on the system, that so many of the fruits of modernity, so much of the wealth that we’ve gained in the past few hundred years can at least be in part attributed to the ways we’ve used law to turn these ordinary assets into wealth-generating capital, that it’s this miracle of our modern world that we’ve been able to create legal fictions that then allow us to generate wealth in this way. And so I’m wondering how you wrestle with this tension. Because on the other hand, I think you’re right. I think, at least at the very least now — and to me, it does feel like there has been a shift because these mechanisms clearly helped enable a lot of wealth generation and creation in previous eras. And now it really does feel like they’re being used as tools of extraction, that they’re contributing more and more often to financial crisis, that they’re leading to these unprecedented levels of inequality. And so I’m just wondering how you navigate and grapple with that tension — that on the one hand, these legal devices can be considered miracles, and on the other hand, they could be considered these really pernicious extractive mechanisms that have harmed our system and a lot of people in it.

katharina pistor

Yeah, no. I think there is this tension. And I also have to say, I do believe in the law. I also believe in the ability to engage in relatively decentralized exchange transactions. So if there’s one message I want to really get across, and I think you just mentioned it, if it is the law, if it is the social resource that creates all this wealth, maybe we can also find a better way of doing this, right? If it’s not just the skills of the most sophisticated people, and we can’t compete with them. They’re just outcompeting us. That’s one thing. If we’re saying, actually, guys, what you’re doing is you’re using something that belongs to us, and that we could also reconfigure in different ways, then we might be producing also social goods in different types of ways. And maybe not by giving them some opportunity to skim off the cream as we’re creating these social goods. So let’s go back to housing. In the late 1960s, the United States decided that the housing crisis will be solved by giving everybody access to credit in a private credit system. That’s a decision to be made. There might be other ways in which we can create housing. There are also other ways in which we can govern the credit system, right? So each of the choices that we make, I think we have to be much more conscious about the extent to which we’re using a social resource for some to then actually get an extra top-off, like with banking. In theory today, with new crypto technologies, you could cut out the middlemen, the banks. You could give all people a wallet at the central bank and have a safe payment system. We can still discuss how to allocate credit, but we could have a safe payment system. And nobody’s going there because the idea that the banks are central to our payment system is so deeply ingrained in the thinking also of the central bankers that we won’t make these kind of choices. What I’m trying to say is actually we have many more choices. And also, I think, looking back is there have always been a lot of losers on the way. Yes, if you look at global statistics and history, et cetera, only with the take-off of capitalism have countries become really wealthy also at a national level. There’s not only more private wealth. There’s also about national wealth. But we can also see, and that’s part of Piketty’s work and his team’s work, is that within these countries, wealth gaps always increase within capitalism as well. If the law is a social resource, could we basically reduce the cost for the losers? Could we make this a more equitable system? I don’t want to say necessarily the answer is no. I think my hope is still that we could. I would also add to that, we must, because climate change might be really the binding constraint that we’re facing, in terms of living with a system that is always expanding, always trying to shift risks to others. We might be able to get away with this a lot within social system, but nature doesn’t care about our ideas. Nature is just reacting its own way, and not in a good way these days.

roge karma

I think that’s a good place to talk about what possible solutions may exist. We spoke earlier about the difficulty of regulation, of taming this very decentralized legal system. But are there solutions that you can imagine that you think can be employed that would maybe retain some of the parts of the system that have brought so much wealth and prosperity and helped us scale society in this way, while also trying to weed out or at least reduce the power of some of these more negative elements? Are there solutions out there that you think are satisfactory? And are there any states trying them?

katharina pistor

So there are probably lots of different solutions. And I think many states are trying to use typically regulatory law, administrative law some kind of caps to cabin the system. And sometimes also quite successfully, I would say. I think some of the consumer protection law in the E.U. or labor protection is probably more advanced than what we have in this country. But my goal in my own work is really to do this, again, internally to the capitalist system, to try to understand the logic of the system and maybe to recode it in a much more fundamental way. So not only to create new constraints outside because my prediction is that it will wiggle around this again, but sort of to rethink the predistribution or the creation of wealth, the use of law to create capital from the outset. So I’m trying to develop some really basic principles, each of which would have to be translated into institutional realization, and that is hard work that I haven’t completed myself yet. But I just want to share with you the direction of my thinking. So it starts with a basic premise that all power should be accountable. All power, not only public power, also private power. And to the extent that these legal modules are being used to create private power, we have to think about how to hold private power accountable. Most people turn to the market to do the accountability, but the market typically plays to some of these constituencies, not to others, and very often uses rather blunt mechanisms like withholding capital altogether from either states or entities, which harms the workers, but not necessarily maybe the management or the government that has done the mismanagement. So we have to think about accountability mechanisms for private parties. We typically rely on the fact that while they have property right, they got consent through contracts. So it’s ex-ante control, so we don’t need exposed accountability. But I think in political systems, we don’t vote only once and say forever they can now wield power over us, but we vote repeatedly, and we have other mechanisms of control as well. So we need more checks and balances in the economy. So that’s just one. The other one is I would simply say there shouldn’t be any rights without obligations. So if you insist on limited liability and on plowing all the profits back and not being responsible for the company that goes under under your hands— and I’m talking about the investors now, of course — then this might have an impact on how we treat you and your rights as a shareholder to begin with. So this would be another one. No rights without responsibility. Just to recap, so we’re saying no power without accountability. No rights without responsibilities. And then I would add to that only humans are rights holders. We have conferred many of the individual rights that some say would come from natural law. I do not believe in that, but of individual rights, human rights. We have used many of these mechanisms to say, well, corporations are rights holders, too. I still would say corporations can own assets, but they should not necessarily get the same kind of constitutional protection for ownership that individuals do, or only their shareholders behind that in a pro-rata fashion, which would change the argument quite radically. I don’t see why a Supreme Court in this country can argue that corporations shall have religious right or freedom of speech. They can’t speak. They’re legal creatures. They’re not entities they act only through humans and on behalf of the humans in the end, and I think we should be more clear on that. And then last but not least, I would say, and you will not have access to the coercive means that the state has on offer unless you abide by principles one through three. So the logic is basically, actually, I have nothing against markets. I have nothing against exchange. I have nothing against making autonomous decision. I do not want to have central planning. But I think if we want to be true to some of these mechanisms, if we want to go back to the logic that Adam Smith associated with markets, that’s a very, very different market from the kind of monster we have created over the last couple of centuries.

roge karma

I think that’s such a powerful framework. And I’m interested in trying one other idea on you because one thing I began wondering while reading your book is that if really any asset, real or imagined, can be coded as capital, then what would it mean to use that power to make the world better? You mentioned the climate crisis earlier, and the idea that kept coming to my head about this was from Kim Stanley Robinson’s book “The Ministry for The Future,” which takes place sort of in the near future as societies come to grips with climate change. And one of the things that central banks come up with in that future is these things called carbon coins, which are basically currencies that are used to pay companies and individuals and countries for emissions reductions. And reading your book, I started wondering if maybe that isn’t as wild of an idea as it sounds when you first hear it, right? All capital is, is the promise of future returns coded in law. So it doesn’t seem so crazy to me that if we wanted to, we could use these same techniques we’ve been talking about in this conversation to transform a different kind of future returns, the returns generated by a healthy climate, into law. So I’m wondering what you think of that idea, and then more broadly about this possibility of trying to use the coding techniques that have, in so many ways, been used for sort of the powerful and in ways that sort of degrade our system, and take those techniques and use them in ways that could actually make the world better.

katharina pistor

No, I think this is my hope as well. I mean, why am I writing books like this? Because I think I want to do a diagnosis that we can turn into something different as well. So if it is — and I’m convinced that it is — if it is the social resource that in the hands of some becomes something that is highly monetizable and profitable, we could also do other things with it. The grain of salt I want to throw into this, this will not be as profitable for some as the past has been. And I don’t think it should be. But I think that’s also the power struggle that we have to go through because some will claim and they will claim this as theirs. They have had their property rights, including the corporations. They have entrenched interest in the system operating the way it is and delivering the returns that they want. And I think any kind of recoding will take away a little bit of the punch bowl for making the amounts of money that are being made. There are still returns. We want to have a competitive system. But we also want to have other values being vindicated with the social resource. And survival of most people in humane conditions on this planet seems to be a worthwhile task. But it’s not something that you can easily monetize, so we want to direct our social resource to something which is, I believe, is an urgent task, but we have to think very hard how to do this and also how to reconfigure some of the legal institutions that we have to make this possible. We talked a lot about limited liability, right? It was a great invention to broaden the capital base. Now we have enough capital floating around today. We don’t need so much liability maybe to get even more. But we do have an issue with investing in brown assets. Brown assets are basically assets of companies, shares, bonds, other financial assets in companies that pollute. And there are a number of investors out there who don’t believe the transition is coming and that it’s enormously profitable to invest in brown assets. And they would also argue it’s actually very difficult to price the future risk of brown assets. And I would basically argue we can make it easier for them to price the risk of brown assets by taking away limited liability. If you consciously and intentionally invest in something that we know is destroying the living conditions for humans — the planet will survive without us. That’s not the issue. The question is whether we will survive on this planet. If you knowingly destroy the conditions for us to survive on this planet in order to make short-term profit, I’m not sure why we should give you a limited liability. And if investors realize, they might also find the skills to ensure that they price in the cost of the losses that they will have to take themselves as well in the future. So I think there are a number of institutional ways that this really has to go if we want to be serious about this. And then the question is how to fight the political struggle to get there.

I just have one last question before we get to books because you mentioned earlier that it’s a lot of your students who are the ones who end up engaging in the kind of problematic legal manipulation that we’ve been discussing here. But it also seems like it’s those same students who are going to be needed to implement the kind of solutions we’ve been discussing to push the system in the right direction, especially considering how decentralized the law is. So what is it that you say to these students and to law students more broadly who are about to graduate and be faced with this huge amount of responsibility in how they use their talents?

katharina pistor

For me, of course, I’m honest with my students. I tell them what I think. I also realized the bind that they are in. And I said before, I’m also part of the system. So they’re paying a lot of fees to come to Columbia Law School. It’s another part of a capitalist system, where we think yes, of course, people who make a lot of money in the future can also pay high fees for their legal education. And so they do. But when they graduate from institutions such as Columbia or Harvard or N.Y.U. or you name it, they come out with a lot of debt. And the easiest way for them to reduce their debt is to go with capital in the big Wall Street firms. So it is a kind of a cycle. I mean, what I’m trying to tell the students is exactly what you said before. This is a phenomenal social resource, and there are lots of different things we can do with it. And it starts, at least as long as we’re together at the law school, the process to think about alternatives. Typically, law is being taught mostly looking backwards, telling the students how the courts have decided or what legislation exists already, less so how to imagine a different future. They learn this in part when they practice law, but then they’ll learn it in a particular way, how to make the most money for their clients basically. And I would like to harness that potential and say, can we imagine how to use this enormous intellectual potential to do things differently? And I think it is there, and I do find also the aspiration amongst the students. I think this generation knows very well that they are living in volatile times, that their future is very uncertain. And they think very hard about where they want to go. There are entire law students organizations that have blacklisted law firms that are only defending brown asset issuers, because then we’re just not going to go there. So you see from the student body itself a search for alternatives. And I think that gives me ammunition to say, let’s just do this together.

roge karma

I think that’s a great place to end, and I hope many of those students are listening to you. So let’s go to the question we always end “The Ezra Klein Show” on, which is what are three books that have influenced you that you would recommend to the audience?

katharina pistor

So of course, I have to mention Piketty’s “Capital in the 21st Century.” Many of the data that he provided there were, for me, ammunition to think about the legal structures that might actually help explain the data underneath it. So that would be one. I would also, in terms especially the financial crisis that we talked about a lot, I would name Adam Tooze’s “Crashed,” which I think is a great book that also goes into some length into the legal structures of C.D.O.s and C.D.S.‘s. But it’s, of course, written by a global historian who really can paint the big brushes of the interdependencies of the financial system and the institutions. And then a book that came out after I wrote my book, but one by an author who I quote in the book at the very beginning when I define capitalists, is Jonathan Levy. And he published a book, I think it was last year, “Ages of American Capitalism,” where he goes through this history of American capitalism and combines institutional, legal, and cultural and economic history in a way that I found enormously inspiring.

At least 17 people were killed yesterday in a Russian strike on Kostyantynivka, a city in eastern Ukraine that is close to the front lines, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. The attack, one of the deadliest strikes in Ukraine in months, came hours after the U.S. secretary of state, Antony Blinken, arrived in Kyiv for an unannounced visit.

The attack hit an outdoor market around 2 p.m., a time when it is usually bustling with activity, Ukrainian officials said. A child was among those killed, according to the prime minister, and the interior minister said 32 people had been injured.

In Kyiv, Blinken announced more than $1 billion in new U.S. aid to Ukraine, including $665.5 million in military and other security assistance. He noted that much of the aid was intended not for the current fight but for long-term security and rebuilding Ukrainian society. In total, the U.S. has pledged more than $70 billion in financial, humanitarian and military assistance to Ukraine.

The visit from Blinken, who met with Zelensky, came as the Ukrainian counteroffensive in the southeast gained some traction after three months of grueling fighting. Ukrainian troops have broken through a main line of Russia’s defenses in one location, Ukraine’s Army has said, and are turning their attention to breaking through in another heavily defended patch of territory."

Flood insurance is a crucial piece of the complex puzzle that many home buyers need to secure before sealing a real estate deal. Without it, they cannot easily get a home loan. Regulators require lenders offering mortgages for homes in “special flood hazard areas” to ensure that flood insurance policies are in place for them. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled entities that back the bulk of U.S. mortgages, require it for homes in those areas, too.

But as climate change makes weather events more extreme and less predictable, and as growing cities leave less room for water to safely drain away, flood insurance is harder to get. As a backstop, Congress created the National Flood Insurance Program, which is run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Without the program, some homeowners could struggle to keep their houses insured. And any claims made by policyholders would be paid only until FEMA’s funds ran out.

Government officials are aware of the problem and are trying to soften its effects. Federal regulators, along with Fannie and Freddie, will suspend their flood insurance requirements if the government shuts down, the National Association of Realtors said on its website. That means banks and other mortgage lenders would have to decide whether to force home buyers to have it, according to the real estate trade group. For a short time, buyers and sellers could also help each other by transferring existing policies from seller to buyer to prevent a sale from falling through.

“The longer the shutdown, the more harm done,” Shannon McGahn, a lobbyist for the group, said in the article."

Beginning last spring, not long after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the fear of gas shortages spread across the continent, along with fears of what might follow. The coming winter crunch was compared to wartime, with energy experts less focused on whether it would bring rationing than how much. Others suggested that spectacular price spikes would mean suspensions of energy markets and that the continent as a whole would experience not a “cost of living crisis” but a crisis of “molecules” — in which there wasn’t enough energy to be had, no matter the price. A recession was simply taken for granted among the commentariat — almost like a badge of honor demonstrating the moral valor of standing up to Vladimir Putin.

Europe as a whole has indeed endured a lot through the cold months: dramatic spikes in energy prices, with wholesale prices for electricity and gas growing as much as 15-fold, often accompanied by similar spikes in government relief. Countries from Germany to Denmark and Italy spent more than 5 percent of G.D.P. to shield citizens from the crunch, enacting public conservation measures that darkened city streets and limited power use in other ways. In Britain, average bills were expected to grow by 80 percent before the government artificially lowered the average annual household energy bill to about $3,000. Across the continent, people turned their thermostats down and snuggled with hot water bottles at night. Industry was dialed back in places but also often found alternative power supplies.

All told, though, the worst has not come to pass. There were no blackouts, as experts were warning as recently as December. There was no significant mortality from the cold. Industrial production took some hits but didn’t disappear, and indeed, economic forecasters who were six months ago almost unanimously predicting a continentwide recession are now almost unanimously predicting ongoing, if limited, economic growth. There are still worries about whether next winter will prove as manageable as this one, but natural gas storage levels have remained high for months, and gas prices have now fallen back to where they were in September of 2021, several months before the invasion.

What is perhaps most remarkable is that the European Union has not just managed to avert a crisis but has actually “turbocharged the green transition,” as The Economist recently put it, potentially enough to knock a full decade off the continent’s decarbonization timeline."

They ask only to be allowed to help themselves in the face of failing emergency services and federal aid. But the entrenched vulnerabilities produced by colonialism are not so easily overcome. For example, some residents have been begging tourists to stay away as the community recovers. But others have said that as much as they would like the time to mourn, they simply can’t afford it — especially when all they have received from the government is $700. This is what happens when your economy hinges on the pleasure of others.

Maui residents who were already being pushed out by unaffordable housing prices and a lack of career opportunities beyond hospitality will now probably feel the same push to migrate that Puerto Ricans did after Hurricane Maria. It will only worsen if weeks of absent federal aid turn into months of bureaucratic labyrinths and endless red tape, as has happened so often. Here again I think about how after Hurricane Maria only 40 percent of FEMA applicants received any aid at all and a little over 1 percent received the maximum payout.

The challenge of repairing damaged homes without adequate support — as well as persistent power outages, deteriorating bridges and a failing health system — has made it increasingly difficult for Puerto Ricans to stay put. This has combined with the influx of digital nomads and federal tax-evading millionaires, along with a growing Airbnb market that has priced many people out of their own communities.

The State of Hawaii has said it will protect locals from land speculators. But if the bureaucracy of emergency management stalls out or fails, people who have temporary hotel vouchers or are overstaying their welcome on their cousins’ couches will be left with few options other than to sell.

We are facing nothing less than an existential crisis, and in that context the potential loss of a few amphibians in a few unprotected wetlands might not be the greatest source of grief in the world.

Those actions included phone calls that Trump made to pressure state officials to overturn the results, as well as the harassment of local election workers by Trump supporters, false claims of ballot fraud, a plan by Trump allies to create a slate of bogus electors and a data breach at an elections office in rural Coffee County, Ga.

But in my home, as in millions of others piped for gas cooking, getting an induction range would require extensive electrical work and the capping of my existing gas line. Induction stoves also tend to cost slightly more than comparable gas stoves (but new tax credits could change that). Also, you don’t have to entirely replace your stove to mitigate the health dangers of cooking with gas — upgrading and always turning on your ventilation hood, if you have one, is a very good idea.

It’s no surprise, then, that induction stoves have struggled to take off; according to a survey by Consumer Reports, only about 3 percent of American households have them.

“It can be pretty involved and expensive, and I’m not sure the payoff is there for a lot of people,” said Liam McCabe, a journalist at the energy-advising guide EnergySage who writes often about his own efforts to upgrade his home from gas to electricity. McCabe said the article he wrote for Consumer Reports on his switch from a gas stove to induction could have been headlined: “Do-Gooder Pays Through the Nose to Boil Water a Little Faster.”

McCabe also pointed out that if you want to make a significant dent in your home’s environmental impact, cooking isn’t the place to start. Heating and cooling is. On average, about half of the energy used by American households goes to space heating and air-conditioning; an additional 20 percent goes to heating water. Everything else — lighting, refrigeration, TVs, computers, clothes drying and cooking — accounts for less than 30 percent of the average household’s energy usage.

Instead of getting an induction stove, then, it might make a lot more sense for you to spend your money on a heat pump, an underappreciated and kind of magical electric device that can replace both a gas-powered furnace and an air-conditioner. But there may be an even simpler and cheaper thing to do first: Weather seal your house. Ed May, a partner at the environmental consulting practice bldgtyp, told me that a lot of the ways to improve your home’s environmental impact are just “really not that exciting at all,” including “lots and lots of insulation.”"

An analysis by The New York Times using satellite images identified about 1,900 structures that appear visibly damaged or destroyed by wildfires in Lahaina, a historic tourist town on the island of Maui in Hawaii.

Wind-fueled wildfires that tore through the island on Tuesday and Wednesday have claimed at least 89 lives, forced the evacuation of thousands and decimated Lahaina.

While the fires were largely contained by Thursday morning, firefighters have continued to battle flare-ups, and emergency workers are still searching for survivors amid smoky and ashy conditions.

Tourists flock to Hawaii in large part for its tropical landscape and lush forests, but the state has also become increasingly vulnerable to wildfires. The area burned annually by wildfires in Hawaii has quadrupled in recent decades.

Invasive grasses that are highly flammable have taken over native vegetation in some areas, and climate change has exacerbated dry and hot conditions that have allowed many wildfires to spread more quickly.

Worsening drought conditions in recent weeks most likely contributed to the latest blaze. Nearly 16 percent of Maui County was in a severe drought on Tuesday, an uptick from about 5 percent the week before, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Lahaina, where the damage from fires was most concentrated, is on the drier, leeward side of the island that tends to receive less rain."

High above the glittering blue waters of Monterey Bay, where surfers and seals bob in the waves, the small two-lane road hugs the surprisingly close edge of the cliffs. On a recent morning, a couple rode a two-seater bicycle along the roadway, soaking in the expansive views of the Pacific Ocean. A group wearing puffer jackets teetered on an impressive outcropping 40 feet above the water to snap a photo.

This 2.7-mile promenade attracts thousands of joggers, sightseers, cyclists and surfers each day. For many who live in Santa Cruz, the corridor feels like an essential part of the identity of the funky beach city, about 75 miles south of San Francisco and home to 62,000 people.

“It’s so much more than a road,” said Hilary Bryant, a former mayor of Santa Cruz. “Tourists come here and they go to West Cliff Drive — it’s like our front yard.”

But the recent high-profile winter storms in California hit the region particularly hard, splitting the Capitola Wharf in half and prompting mudslides that shut down two freeways. Along West Cliff Drive, 20-foot-tall waves dragged chunks of the roadway into the sea, closing parts of the road for at least another six months."

In an interview, Ms. Tompkins said she was as committed as ever to her conservation efforts, helping her find purpose seven years after a deadly kayaking accident upended her life.

In a way, her life as an environmentalist began when Ms. Tompkins was a teenager in Southern California, where she befriended Yvon Chouinard; her family’s beach house neighbored his. She started working in shipping at his climbing-equipment company, and, after college, she became one of the first six employees at a company he founded in 1973, Patagonia.

She had her fingerprints on many parts of the business, helping pick the typeface in the original logo, producing catalogs and heading imagery. Eventually, she rose to lead the company for years in the 1980s and 1990s.

Despite loving the work, she started to feel that something was missing.

“I was really kind of choking and sensing a kind of desperate need to figure out something else that would be as interesting and engaging as Patagonia,” she said, adding, “Sometimes your body hangs there, but your heart is gone, your mind.”"

He also named a reliable insider to chair the Conservative Party, after being forced to fire the previous chairman, Nadhim Zahawi, over his personal tax affairs.

But Mr. Sunak’s critics fell into predictable cavils about “rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.” The Conservative Party, they noted, remains mired behind the opposition Labour Party by double digits in polls.

The idea behind 15-minute cities is not a new one, and is familiar to anyone who has strolled around the historic villages of Europe or remembers bustling Main Streets in the United States before the postwar sprawl that arrived with the Interstate System.

More recently, developments that market themselves as places to live, work and play have helped breathe new life into America’s inner cities.

In the Western Pacific, the process is especially complex because countries and territories have their own systems for measuring, grading and naming tropical cyclones, which they call typhoons instead of hurricanes.

“In Asia it is a bit complicated,” said Clarence Fong, a meteorologist in Macau, a Chinese territory, who works for an intergovernmental committee under the World Meteorological Organization that coordinates typhoon warnings across the region.

Let us explain.

What cyclones have in common.

The scientific definition of a tropical cyclone is straightforward: It is a storm, typically with a diameter of around 200 to 500 kilometers (124 to 311 miles), that begins over a tropical ocean and generates violent winds, torrential rain, high waves and other bad weather. Less powerful storms are called tropical depressions or disturbances."

Judged by a close look at the opinions of recent terms, the Roberts court is closer to a 9-to-0 court than it is a 6-to-3 court.

In recent research, we isolated 87 statutory cases — cases that interpret laws rather than the Constitution itself — from the Supreme Court’s last three terms. We did not study the so-called shadow docket of unsigned and mostly unexplained orders. Instead, we carefully read a set of cases that one might predict would divide the justices because of their methodological and ideological commitments: They all involve not merely the application of case precedent but also the interpretation of text passed by a legislature. With so much ink spilled on a small number of constitutional cases and the presumption that conservative and liberal justices actually read laws differently, we wanted to take a careful look at what is actually the most common type of case.

What we discovered cuts against the view, held by many, that the court is irredeemably political. Of those 87 cases, 37 percent were decided unanimously. If you add to that consensual pile any case that has only one member of the court refusing to sign the majority opinion, you get nearly half of the cases (40 out of 87).

Judged by a close look at the opinions of recent terms, the Roberts court is closer to a 9-to-0 court than it is a 6-to-3 court.

In recent research, we isolated 87 statutory cases — cases that interpret laws rather than the Constitution itself — from the Supreme Court’s last three terms. We did not study the so-called shadow docket of unsigned and mostly unexplained orders. Instead, we carefully read a set of cases that one might predict would divide the justices because of their methodological and ideological commitments: They all involve not merely the application of case precedent but also the interpretation of text passed by a legislature. With so much ink spilled on a small number of constitutional cases and the presumption that conservative and liberal justices actually read laws differently, we wanted to take a careful look at what is actually the most common type of case.

What we discovered cuts against the view, held by many, that the court is irredeemably political. Of those 87 cases, 37 percent were decided unanimously. If you add to that consensual pile any case that has only one member of the court refusing to sign the majority opinion, you get nearly half of the cases (40 out of 87).

The other cases do not come out along predictably partisan lines, either: There were actually only 10 cases over three years that generated the ideological division you might expect given the court’s configuration. The subjects of a handful of the cases predictably triggered the partisan divide. For example, our study picked up the court’s unwillingness, 6 to 3, to let the Biden administration use interpretations of statutes to effectuate debt relief, mandate Covid vaccination broadly through the Occupational Health and Safety Act or use the Clean Air Act to address climate change as it wanted to."

Uncertain of the impact of new deterrent measures, migrants braved turbulent rivers, cut through concertina wire and scaled the steel border wall to reach the United States and turn themselves in to U.S. Border Patrol agents. On some days last week, apprehensions reached about 11,000, among the highest recorded.

Alejandro Mayorkas, Homeland Security secretary, said on Sunday that agents apprehended only 6,300 migrants on Friday and 4,200 on Saturday. The Biden administration’s new policy, combining the carrot of new legal pathways with the stick of more punitive measures for unlawful crossings, was working, Mr. Mayorkas said in television interviews.

Most migrants now must prove that they were first denied asylum in a country they passed through en route to the United States. And they could face criminal prosecution, prolonged detention and a five-year ban from re-entering."

I think a lot about the next generation and what we’ve been able to do to invest in first-generation college students and young adults. To give you one example: SJ Aspires — we’re using a digital platform to help guide first-generation students on the path to college, and we provide micro-scholarships to reduce financial barriers to college. We completely eliminated the digital divide for low-income students by providing free broadband to more than 150,000 residents. A program we launched called the Resilience Corps is helping hundreds of low-income young adults make their way into the work force through work that dramatically improves our communities’ resilience to climate change and the pandemic and other challenges we face"

The rangers told me that on the one hand, most visitors still ask the questions they always have: Does the bay freeze over in winter? Is that a seal or an eagle on that iceberg? Like generations of tourists before them, they have come to see the wild planet, not some sad memorial to its passing. A few ask how the glaciers are doing. They want to know why Alaska is warming so much faster than other places. A young family told me they had come now before it was too late.

On the other hand, one ranger told me, certain travelers really want to argue. They tell her that technology will fix the problem, or they explain why fixes proposed so far would be too expensive. Or, frequently, they declare that the park’s warming trend is a natural planetary thing.

A difficulty the National Park Service faces, trying to tell the story of today’s science, is that the park’s own brochure maps show lines and dates of a glacial retreat that do indeed make it look like a natural planetary thing. At Glacier Bay, the retreat — really more of a rout — began around 1750, when the glacial advance during a centuries-long period of cooler temperatures known as the Little Ice Age had reached its maximum extent. The entire bay was covered by a glacier more than 4,000 feet thick. The British Navy captain George Vancouver mapped the outer edge when he visited in 1794. By the time the naturalist John Muir arrived in 1879, the ice had already retreated 40 miles up the bay. The smokestacks of the Industrial Revolution had only just started spewing carbon into the atmosphere.

Today, cruise ships must travel 65 miles into the bay, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, to reach the last few majestic faces of ice. These ballyhooed encounters draw even nature-averse passengers onto their balconies, where they squint through their phones and listen for the famous “white thunder” of calving icebergs, as great towers of ice peel off the glacier’s face into the water. In a stable ice field system, each rumble and splash is exciting evidence of forward movement, of nature’s dynamic equilibrium. With the system now breaking down, each crashing iceberg felt like another loss.

Here’s how the park’s scientists had explained it to me: Tidewater glaciers like those at Glacier Bay, when healthy, advance slowly over centuries toward the sea, pushing before them a shield of rocky moraine scraped from the mountainsides. Eventually such a glacier extends into the ocean. The rock armor tumbles into the deep. Exposed to the forces of the sea, the ice face begins breaking apart, and the glacier retreats to the mountains, where it begins to gather new moraine for its next slow advance."

Residents, for example, need better advance notice of any public health emergency, and not simply on social media, which is how the Adams administration primarily interacted with the public for the first 24 hours of the crisis.

The mayor could have also issued a Code Red, usually used for heat emergencies, to deploy outreach workers to help coax homeless New Yorkers off the street and into shelters. He could have coordinated with the governor to use the subway system announcements to communicate about the smoke with residents. He could have even directed city vehicles like police cars to issue warnings from their loudspeakers.

The mayor could have worked quickly to distribute high-quality N95 masks — and critically, information — to New Yorkers, especially in the city’s most vulnerable communities. Gov. Kathy Hochul, by contrast, directed that masks be distributed in transit hubs and other state-owned facilities, which is a good start. The city’s Fire Department, which reports to the mayor, finally said on Twitter Thursday it would have masks available at certain locations. Good. The Department of Education said all students would shift to remote learning on Friday, rather than just the younger grades, which were already scheduled to have the day off for a “clerical day.”

The city’s enormous municipal government has the capacity to do more to help residents weather this ordeal. During summer heat waves, the city often opens cooling centers.

These insects flap more than 2,000 miles from their summer homes in Canada down to the mountains of central Mexico. Only about 30 percent survive the trip. Researchers have found a shared trait in the butterflies that make it: The edges of their wings tend to be slightly spottier.

“No one even knew what these spots were for in monarchs,” said Andy Davis, a biologist at the University of Georgia and an author of a study published on Wednesday in the journal PLOS ONE. He added, “All of a sudden, it seems like they’re really important.”

Monarch wings are mostly orange, but their edges are black, punctuated with tiny white spots. Dr. Davis was curious if those black edges contributed to monarchs’ migratory capabilities. Dark colors absorb more heat, and studies of seabirds have suggested that the temperature difference between dark and light feathers can change air flow patterns, enabling birds with blacktopped wings to “enhance their flight efficiency — basically increasing the lift and decreasing the drag,” said Mostafa Hassanalian, a mechanical engineer at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology.

He and Dr. Davis teamed up to see if the same held true in monarchs, with darker-winged butterflies having an aerodynamic advantage, making them more likely to survive the long migration than spottier peers."

Are you intrigued by them? Afraid of them? Disgusted by them? Indifferent to them?

Do you think the world would be better off without insects? What if you knew that, without them, the “earth’s terrestrial ecosystems would not survive”?

In “Are Butterflies Wildlife? Depends Where You Live,” Catrin Einhorn writes about the importance of bugs to our planet and the challenges of protecting them:

It’s tough being an insect. They get swatted, stomped and sprayed without a thought. Their mere presence can provoke irrational panic. Even everyday language disparages them: “Stop bugging me,” we say. To make matters worse for insects, they have also been sidelined legally in some states, with unintended but serious repercussions. The reason? According to many state statutes, insects are not considered wildlife. Bees, butterflies and beetles pollinate plants, enrich soils and provide a critical protein source for species up the food chain. The United States Forest Service puts it simply: “Without pollinators, the human race and all of earth’s terrestrial ecosystems would not survive.” Ecologically they are “the little things that run the world,” in the words of the biologist E.O. Wilson. But those little things are increasingly threatened. Scientists are reporting alarming declines in many species. Some insects appear especially vulnerable to climate change’s supercharged droughts and heat, which hit them hard in addition to chronic pressures like disappearing habitat, widespread pesticides and light pollution. At the same time, conservation officials in at least 12 states — Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Indiana, Nevada, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming — have their hands tied, legally speaking, when it comes to protecting insects. The creatures are simply left out of state conservation statutes, or their situation is ambiguous. “State agencies are really at the forefront of conservation for wildlife,” said Scott Black, executive director of the Xerces Society, a nonprofit group that advocates for insect conservation. “But in these states where they can’t work on insects, or in some cases any invertebrates, they don’t. So, you see things just languish.” The problem may stem in part from the intention of state agencies when they were created roughly a century ago: to protect wild species from getting hunted or fished to extinction. And, to be clear: Bugs are not totally unregulated. Agricultural departments control for invasive species or those that damage crops, but that typically entails killing them. Some do pollinator education, too. Sometimes, aquatic insects come under the purview of state wildlife agencies. Other times, help may come once insects are struggling enough to be on the road to federal protection under the Endangered Species Act. But often, there’s nobody in charge of conservation.

Students, read the entire article and then tell us:

Did this article change your mind about insects and the role they play in the ecosystem? Do bugs deserve more respect?

The article says that state agencies remain focused on protecting species that are hunted and fished. Should states do more to ensure that insects are also legally protected? Or are they doing enough?

Money is a major obstacle for conservation. With limited government budgets and so many other causes that need funding, how much of a priority should bugs be?

If you do support more insect conservation, what would you say to the farming and development industries that might be affected by stricter regulations? If you don’t support more conservation, what would you say to ecologists who think it’s necessary?

Would you be interested in learning more about insect conservation, perhaps by participating in a citizen science project or even becoming an ecologist yourself one day? If so, what do you find intriguing about this field? If not, why not?

On Oct. 24, 30 progressive members of Congress wrote President Biden a letter about Ukraine policy. The letter blamed Russia for the war. It endorsed military aid to Ukraine and long-term security guarantees to ensure it remains “free and independent.” And while it proposed “a proactive diplomatic push” to end the fighting, it also insisted that it “is not America’s place to pressure Ukraine’s government regarding sovereign decisions.”

Given that Mr. Biden has already said the war must end in a “negotiated settlement” and that his top advisers are already talking to their Russian counterparts, the missive largely encouraged him to continue what he’s already doing. Daniel Drezner, an international relations scholar at Tufts University, called it “a giant nothingburger.”

And yet its release sparked a ferocious backlash. An official from the centrist think tank Third Way claimed the letter’s proposals “dishonor” the Ukrainian people’s “courageous sacrifice by suggesting they give up everything they’ve been fighting for.” Representative Jake Auchincloss, Democrat of Massachusetts, called it “an olive branch to a war criminal.” Within a day of the letter’s publication, its authors retracted it.

They retracted it because a new Cold War atmosphere now pervades Washington. Politicians who suggest even modest compromises with America’s great power foes face censure from both sides of the aisle. During the last Cold War, fears of appearing soft on communism cowed progressive legislators into silence as the United States descended into war in Vietnam. After the attacks of Sept. 11, many Democrats acquiesced to the Bush administration’s invasion of Iraq because they feared being called soft on terrorism. When it comes to Russia and China, another climate of conformity is now taking hold. Unless challenged, it could eventually bring disaster as well."

Without her, it would not be spring.

Eastern phoebes are in the flycatcher family and consume not just flies, but also wasps, grasshoppers and even ticks — great news to those of us who can’t walk in the woods without getting bitten. Native to North America, they also eat small berries from our native plants such as Virginia creeper. Its call is like its name: an onomatopoeic “fee bee.”

I puzzled at first if the bird might be an eastern wood-pewee, another grayish white flycatcher with a short bill, but the giveaway was the way the eastern phoebe wags her tail when she flies off the nest and lands on the lilac bush by the stream.

Eastern phoebes have the distinction of being the first bird ever banded, in 1804 by John James Audubon himself. He, too, watched an eastern phoebe nest at his farm in Mill Grove, Pa., about 200 miles east of here as the flycatcher flies. One autumn day, the story goes, he tied silver threads onto the legs of five nestlings before they migrated south and reported that two of the marked birds returned the next spring."

Britain, which is facing strict fiscal constraints, won’t have a “subsidy bowl” like the United States, Mr. Hunt said last month. Regardless of the economic cost, British officials argue that they prefer a more free-market approach but are offering some subsidies on a case-by-case basis or through grants that companies can compete for.

The nomenclature was not entirely frivolous. Dr. Bonaldo, a researcher at the Paraense Emílio Goeldi Museum in Brazil, said in an interview that the spiders’ wide, fused heads and thoraxes, known as the cephalothorax, and long abdomen of the spiders “make them ideal candidates for names inspired by the Star Trek universe.”"

Park had attracted tourists since the 1920s, evolving into an unofficial community hub. Like the Silver Sands, it was wiped off the map. For now, the land it stood on sits empty, but this month, the nearly 10-acre Red Coconut property was sold for $52 million to Seagate Development Group, which has developed numerous communities of multimillion-dollar homes in Southwest Florida.

Developed in response to Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and put in place in 2002, building codes require, among other things, that structures within a mile of shorelines prone to high winds have impact-resistant windows and that those in flood zones be anchored on pilings or columns clearing the height of anticipated flooding and have ground-level breakaway walls (or no ground-level walls at all) to let water pass through during floods. In cases of rebuilding after storms, if repair costs amount to at least 50 percent of a property’s value, the owner is required to rebuild in adherence to the new codes. For most homes in Fort Myers Beach, this means that rebuilding what was there before Ian isn’t an option. For a hotel development like Margaritaville, the building codes helped it weather Ian with damage from which it could recover.

Building up to code is costly — far more so than building wood-frame beach bungalows. It also requires a tolerance for risk that often only money can buy; when insurance no longer covers full rebuilding costs, mainly those with deep pockets can build on the water. That means existing property owners like those of the Silver Sands, Red Coconut and countless private homes end up cutting their losses and selling. What will go up are apparently second homes and luxury resorts that can turn a profit in a few years before another hurricane hits. (A new hotel typically pays for itself in five to 15 years, obviating the need to think about 30 years down the line, when sea levels will have risen even further.) For well-funded developers, the risk and expense can be worth it, even if it means betting on a potentially doomed parcel of land.

They’re also banking on the infinite desirability of the beachfront, as are the state authorities responsible for the building codes that allow redevelopment after hurricanes and floods. But when the beaches have to be fortified against erosion and sea level rise, taxpayers and governments are stuck with the bill.

Instead, the state could cultivate solutions that benefit a wider set of people who want to live near the coast: temporary, movable structures for tourists and residents and other ways to motivate people to move away from the riskiest places, a strategy called managed retreat. The biggest obstacle to managed retreat remains local resistance. From the Florida Keys to the Outer Banks of North Carolina to New York City, homeowners have so far largely resisted efforts to encourage relocation even as the rising tides bear down on their areas."

Mr. Biden hosted a boisterous ceremony in the East Room of the White House while allies and aides conducted briefings, gave speeches, published newspaper articles, sent emails, went on television and distributed talking points to mark the first anniversary of the Inflation Reduction Act, the major climate and energy law that is one of the signature accomplishments of his presidency.

The fact that the anniversary came at the same time as a significant decrease in the inflation rate was more happy coincidence than anything else, say economists, who attribute it more to the Federal Reserve’s interest rate increases and other factors. The legislation did plenty of important things in terms of investing in clean energy, raising corporate taxes and curbing prescription drug prices. But it was not really about inflation. As even Mr. Biden implicitly conceded last week, the name of the bill was more about political branding than policy goals.

Nonetheless, the president and his staff decided a little festivity was in order. The legislation, after all, advanced plenty of cherished Democratic priorities and will be one of Mr. Biden’s major arguments for a second term in next year’s election."

Still, it is clear that the condition is significantly underdiagnosed, said Dr. Maya Jerath, an allergist and immunologist at Washington University in St. Louis, who has treated hundreds of patients with alpha-gal syndrome. “This is a story that every patient of mine tells me, that ‘I had to go to five physicians before they could tell me what it was,’” said Dr. Jerath, who was not involved in the new studies. “It’s nice to have numbers behind it, and it’s definitely a call to action.”

Alpha-gal syndrome, which was not formally identified until the 2000s, takes its name from galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose, a sugar present in beef, pork, lamb and the meat of most other mammals. (It is not present in humans or other apes.) Lone star ticks, which scientists believe are the primary culprits of the disease in the United States, can transmit the sugar to people through a bite. Some people’s immune systems may then label this foreign sugar a threat and overreact to its presence the next time they eat meat.

The symptoms, which often take hours to appear, are wide-ranging, and may include hives, nausea, diarrhea or anaphylactic shock. Even patients who have the syndrome may not feel sick every time they eat meat. “It’s consistently inconsistent,” Dr. Salzer said. “So this makes it a real challenge for health care providers.”

To diagnose the syndrome, clinicians can order a blood test to determine whether a patient has antibodies to alpha-gal. Until August 2021, a single commercial lab did nearly all of this antibody testing in the United States. In one of the new studies, researchers reviewed the results of the antibody tests performed at this lab from 2017 to 2022."

Walking through the Folly is a march through time. Some of its stories are older than humans — Homo sapiens are relative youngsters in the world’s timeline, having entered the evolutionary picture less than half a million years ago. Nearby, a teenage Osage orange bristled with spiky green flowers that will soon grow into what are often called monkey brains, the knobbly neon green balls that all animals loathe — the fruit tastes awful — and some say is kryptonite to cockroaches (it’s not).

Osage oranges evolved in tandem with the giant ground sloths that roamed the earth some 80 million years ago and considered its fruit a delicacy; the sloths died out about 10,000 years ago. The Osage orange’s curious back story means that the fruit is useless from an evolutionary standpoint, Mr. Marder said, “because the animals they were designed for, the animals that ate them and then pooped them out to spread their seeds are long gone.”

This particular cultivar is called the Cannonball because its fruit is two-thirds bigger than the regular Osage oranges, which means that it’s two-thirds more useless, he added. The anachronism delights him. It’s one of his favorite trees in the arboretum."

Gavin Newsom’s budget proposal — that puts $2 billion in previously planned spending for public transit infrastructure on the chopping block — and more than a little bit concerned that the Legislature will go along with it at a moment when local transit systems need more money, not less.

Newsom’s proposal could lead to service cuts that will be punishing for millions of commuters who depend on transit. They’ll also be terrible for the millions who don’t ride the bus or take the train — if transit riders feel like their only realistic alternative is to drive, the freeways are going to be very unpleasant. The cuts would also make it far more difficult for California to meet its ambitious goals to address climate change and the state’s housing woes — issues on which Newsom has tried to project national leadership."

I think his choice was the right one. Biden administration officials, who have been quick in conversation to tout their involvement in the I-95 rebuild, also look at the project with pride. But the key point here is that the process Shapiro used is abnormal. In effect, liberals have chosen to trust elected politicians less and trust regulatory and judicial processes more to ensure that government delivers what voters want and what justice demands. I think that may have made sense in a past era, but given the problems we face now, it is a mistake. Shapiro’s success rebuilding I-95 built political power for him, and it built political power for organized labor — but it could do that only because it put the success of the project first.

This gets to an omission in Dayen’s argument. In focusing on how power can be gained, he is ignoring the very real way in which it can be lost. Power is lost when projects fail — and it is lost by the very interest groups Dayen wants to defend.

If union labor and Democratic governance are seen by the public as reasons that needed infrastructure remains endlessly unfinished and relentlessly over budget, that will, eventually, lead the public to demand alternatives. The result will be the outsourcing of public services to private companies and the election of new politicians who will pass laws designed to limit the ability of labor to organize.

I’d like to see a stronger labor movement in America, which is one of many reasons I support sectoral bargaining and the mandated appointment of workers to corporate boards. Plenty of countries with stronger unions than America complete transit projects more rapidly and more affordably than we do. But one of the major challenges of pro-labor politics in the United States is the public perception that unions often slow construction rather than make it better, and that perception is rooted in real failures of real projects in places where liberals and unions hold real power. I don’t think that’s impossible to fix, but it is impossible to fix if liberals refuse to admit that it is true and refuse to make the policy changes necessary to prove that it’s untrue.

Reading Dayen put me in mind of a paper by Michael Gerrard, the founder of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia, “A Time for Triage.” In it, Gerrard argues that “rather than climate denial, the environmental community has trade-off denial. We don’t recognize that it’s too late to preserve everything we consider precious, and to linger in making decisions.” This is, I would suggest, a broader problem on the left."

MOAB, Utah — Blake Votilla stared up at the 120-foot spruce tree. He strapped braces with four-inch spurs to his shins and clipped two large red plastic sacks on his climbing harness. Reggaeton blasted from a portable speaker on his hip.

Then he embraced the tree with his gloved hands, sticky from sap, lifting his left leg up first, driving the spur into the cracks of the bark to hoist himself up.

Mr. Votilla, 30, was here in the Manti-La Sal National Forest, which covers stretches of Utah and Colorado and is known for its Engelmann spruce trees, as part of a federal program that hires contractors to climb the trees and collect their cones. The seeds from the cones are sent around the country and ultimately get planted to regrow forests that have been decimated by wildfire or deforestation. These efforts have become more urgent at a time when the rate and intensity of forest fires have increased and the country is attempting to meet ambitious climate goals."

The vaccine is incorporated into royal jelly, a sugar feed given to queen bees. Once they ingest it, the vaccine is then deposited in their ovaries, giving developing larvae immunity as they hatch.

Scientists long assumed that insects could not acquire immunity because they lacked antibodies, the proteins that help many animals’ immune systems recognize and fight bacteria and viruses. Once scientists understood that insects could indeed acquire immunity and pass it to their offspring, Dr. Freitak set about answering the question of how they did so. In 2015, she and two other researchers identified the specific protein that prompts an immune response in the offspring and realized they could cultivate immunity in a bee population with a single queen.

Their first goal was tackling American foulbrood, a bacterial disease that turns larvae dark brown and makes the hive give off a rotting smell. The disease ran rampant during the 1800s and the early 1900s in bee colonies in parts of the United States. While American foulbrood is not as destructive as varroa mites, the bacterium can easily wipe out colonies of 60,000 bees.

The introduction of a vaccine comes at a critical moment for honeybees, which are vital to the world’s food system but are also declining globally because of climate change, pesticides, habitat loss and disease.

Regulators are under pressure to act. A United Nations convention establishes waters beyond 12 nautical miles from a territorial coast as communal property, which means that profits from minerals discovered there should be shared to some extent. The I.S.A. is responsible for setting up the structure for profit-sharing and taxing of mining efforts, as well as the legal and ecological guidelines. Or it could ban large-scale commercial mining altogether — though it’s not clear there is a legal path for a pause.

Mining could damage ecosystems that scientists don’t yet understand, said Jessica Battle, an ocean policy expert at the World Wildlife Fund. A study published in the journal Nature on Tuesday, for example, argued that seabed mining could interfere with tuna migration patterns as climate change drives fish into new waters. Ms. Battle has been leading an effort to have businesses pledge not to finance seabed mining or source seafloor materials in their supply chains. More than 30 companies, including BMW, Google, Samsung, Volvo and Volkswagen, have signed on. Similarly, prominent banks in Britain, such as Lloyds and Standard Chartered, are refusing to do business with deep-sea mining entities. And seafood industry groups have demanded a moratorium.

Some also doubt the economic opportunity. Electric vehicles are expected to make up about 35 percent of cars sold globally by 2030, up from 14 percent in 2022, according to projections from the International Energy Agency. That growth will increase demand for metals like cobalt, copper and nickel that are used in batteries. But critics say that the expense and logistics of mining in the remote ocean — and transporting metals back to land — raise doubts about whether deep-sea mining can be profitable. Ms. Battle argued other solutions in the works — like alternative materials and programs for reusing and recycling batteries — could sufficiently satisfy demand for critical metals. “This industry could start without being needed,” she said of deep-sea mining.

But seabed mining supporters say that existing mining is worse for the environment, and deep-sea mining could help wrestle control of critical metals from China and Russia. Some also see it as an economic lifeline for small island nations that are suffering the worst effects of climate change."

On paper this is a humanitarian gesture, a recognition of the miseries of life under the Maduro dictatorship. In political practice it’s a flailing attempt to respond to a sudden rise in anti-immigration sentiment in blue cities, particularly New York, as the surge of migrants overwhelms social services and shelters.

I say flailing because the fundamental problem facing the Biden administration is on the southern border, where every attempt to get ahead of the extraordinary numbers trying to cross or claim asylum has been overwhelmed.

In Eagle Pass, Texas, The Wall Street Journal reports that in a week, an estimated 10,000 migrants have entered the city, whose entire population is less than 30,000. The subsequent movement of migrants to cities like New York, Chicago and Washington has been encouraged by red-state governors, but under any circumstances such crowds in Eagle Pass would eventually mean rising numbers in big cities. And policies that make it easier to work in those cities, like the Biden move, are likely to encourage more migration until the border is more stable and secure.

The liberal confusion over this situation, the spectacle of Democratic politicians like Eric Adams and Kathy Hochul sounding like Fox News hosts, is a foretaste of the difficult future facing liberals across the Western world."

Regardless of the weather, says Ian Walla, the general manager of the Lower Manhattan location of the Nordic microroaster La Cabra, “for the most part, coffee drinkers are all in on iced or all in on hot — it’s a lot more common for somebody to stick with a temperature.”

Kyle Glanville, a co-founder of Go Get Em Tiger, which has outposts across Los Angeles, attributes the rapid rise of cool drinks to the communal nature of coffee. “It’s such a social beverage that folks are influenced by what others around them are doing,” he says. And if you visit Abraço, an East Village cafe that feels like a good neighborhood bar, those around you will most likely be drinking cold brew. “It’s not seasonal anymore,” says the co-owner Liz Quijada. “The people who get cold brew all spring and summer get cold brew in winter.” For those who want to try something different — and maybe even a little frostier — Quijada recommends the frappé, an off-menu take on a Greek seaside classic. Espresso, simple syrup and ice are blended in a Vitamix, resulting in a texture so rich and creamy that it’s hard to believe the drink is dairy-free. The frappé might be native to the summer cafes of Paros and Crete, but it now has a second home: a wintry New York City. — Oliver Strand"

Our planet may be in better shape than you think,” the Times columnist Nicholas Kristof writes in a recent piece. He points out that human beings tend to focus on the bad news all around us instead of appreciating everything that’s good.

What is your reaction to that sentiment? Do you think we should be optimistic about our world? Why or why not?

In “Cheer Up! The World Is Better Off Than You Think,” Mr. Kristof writes:

Enough with the doom and gloom! Our planet may be in better shape than you think. Human beings have a cognitive bias toward bad news (keeping us alert and alive), and we journalists reflect that: We report on planes that crash, not planes that land. We highlight disasters, setbacks, threats and deaths, so 2022 has kept us busy. But a constant gush of despairing news can be paralyzing. So here’s my effort to remedy our cognitive biases. Until the pandemic, I wrote an annual column arguing that the previous year was the best in human history. I can’t do that this year. But I can suggest that broadly speaking, much is going right and this may still be the best time ever to be alive.

He highlights important progress in renewable energy, health technology and child mortality, and then concludes the essay with:

Max Roser of the indispensable website Our World in Data puts the situation exactly right: “The world is awful. The world is much better. The world can be much better. All three statements are true at the same time.” So all the bad news is real, and I cover it the other 364 days of the year. But it’s also important to acknowledge the gains that our brains (and we journalists) are often oblivious to — if only to remind ourselves that progress is possible when we put our shoulder to it. Onward!

Students, read the entire essay, then tell us:

How optimistic are you about the state of the world? What gives you hope about the times that we live in? Conversely, what makes you worried about our planet?

Mr. Kristof writes that “Human beings have a cognitive bias toward bad news.” Do you tend to focus on doom and gloom, such as disasters, setbacks, threats and deaths? If so, do you think this negatively affects your outlook on life? A plane’s safe landing is not news, Mr. Kristof notes, but a plane crash is. Do you think the news media — and all of us — should break from the bad news bias and focus more on good stories about the successes, improvements and progress in the world?

Despite challenges such as Covid, climate change and the war in Ukraine, Mr. Kristof writes, “much is going right and this may still be the best time ever to be alive.” What do you think of this claim? What examples from the essay do you find most heartening, and why? Does his essay live up to the title and cheer you up?

If you had to choose a time to be born and you didn’t know who you’d be or where in the world you’d live, what era would you choose?

Amid the crowd gathered at the World Economic Forum, Oliver Stone — an unexpected attendee — easily stands out. The filmmaker behind “Wall Street” and “Platoon” has a history of jabbing the political, business and social elite with projects that advance controversial ideas: Think about his films focused on Vladimir Putin, Edward Snowden, John F. Kennedy and more.

Mr. Stone came to Davos with another provocative movie, which advocates for an issue long whispered about here but rarely said aloud: nuclear power as a force for good. In “Nuclear Now!,” which premiered at the Venice Film Festival, he argues that nuclear has been unfairly maligned by oil companies and others to make the public fearful about its safety.

For Mr. Stone, nuclear is the only existing technology that could help meaningfully bring down carbon emissions from energy, and its danger has been drastically overstated, even in light of disasters like the failure of the Fukushima power plant in 2011.

The Davos crowd appeared eager to listen. The theater screening “Nuclear Now!” here was packed — to the point of attendees sitting on the floor. The film was financed in part by two Davos veterans: Roksana Ciurysek-Gedir, a financier, and Zachary Bogue, a venture capitalist and the husband of the former Yahoo C.E.O. Marissa Mayer."

And it’s not only abortion: The Supreme Court also took on the Clean Air Act of 1970 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. We helped win these fights once, turning out by the tens of millions to oppose the war in Vietnam or for the first Earth Day. And we can help win them again — we have the muscle memory of what organizing on a big scale feels like.

Hundreds of us from around the country converged on Nevada in the days before the midterm vote, because we determined — correctly, as it turned out — that it might be the place where control of the Senate would be decided. We may walk a tad slower door to door, but in this case slow and steady helped to win the race.

With the election past, Third Act is now digging into work on climate change — in particular targeting the big American banks (JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Bank of America) that are also the biggest lenders to the fossil fuel industry. On March 21 we’ll be cutting up bank credit cards and picketing bank branches across the country. We know that young people have been in the lead in this fight, because they’ll have to live with the world we’re creating. But as long as we’re still here, we’ll have to live with the knowledge of what we’re leaving behind, so we want to change it while we still can.

We recognize that this will require a sustained effort beyond the next election and the election after that. Numerous analysts and demographers do believe that coming demographic changes in the United States will generally favor Democrats. But complications abound. Partisan gerrymandering continues to favor Republicans, for instance, and at least five states that generally vote Democratic have each lost a seat from their congressional delegations.

But here’s the thing. Many of us are going to be here for quite a while. Ten thousand Americans turn 60 every day, and on average we’ll live an additional 23 years. The last of the baby boomers will be 65 or older in 2030. Youth voters, moreover, are youth voters for only about a decade. One guarantee for 2024: We’ll vote in huge numbers, as we always do. One possibility is that we’ll help turn back the clock a little, toward the world we actually built in our youth.

A Democratic congressman implied that the fall from grace of New York’s former governor Andrew Cuomo was karmic payback for his support for the new tolls, known as congestion pricing. Another accused the head of North America’s largest mass transit system of giving children cancer.

“I feel like the Ginsu knife commercial,” Mr. Murphy, a Democrat, quipped — referring to a 1980s “wait, there’s more!” ad for a kitchen tool with many uses — as he added that New Jersey would pay a bonus to any state resident who worked remotely for a New York company and successfully sued to recoup out-of-state income taxes.

The gloves are off in a long-simmering border war between New York and New Jersey.

Her latest story, which tells the story of Marcos Cux, a 15-year-old who was maimed last year in a chicken plant in rural Virginia run by Perdue, has just published in The Times Magazine.

The story exposes the human costs of this country’s broken immigration system. Over the past 15 years, entering the U.S. without legal permission has become easier, especially for children. A 2008 law, intended to protect children from harm on the Mexican side of the border, has meant that children can usually enter the country without documentation. As Hannah writes, “In the 15 years since, the carveout has become widely known in Central America, where it shapes the calculations of destitute families.”

Likewise, a 2015 ruling by a federal judge made it easier for children to enter the country with their families, as a recent New Yorker story by Dexter Filkins explained."

Security concerns remain paramount.

Still, analysts noted that any softening in approach remained limited to economic or business policies that did not involve China’s national security, which has become a defining feature of Chinese policy in recent years. And there are few signs that the top leader, Xi Jinping, has endorsed a broad policy shift toward the United States, a step that would be necessary for any change to take root.

On Saturday, China announced that it would hold joint naval and air force exercises with the Russian military in the Sea of Japan. And Mr. Xi himself gave a speech on July 6 urging the military to “break new ground” in war preparedness, warning that “China’s security situation is facing rising instability and uncertainty,” according to the official Xinhua news agency.

China has also taken steps this month that could undermine its reputation as a reliable link in global supply chains. It said it would limit exports of rare materials needed to make semiconductors, in a step widely seen as retaliation for American limits on the sale of advanced semiconductors to China."

First, a pregnant mare fell ill and died. Soon, more horses were sick, spiking fevers and expelling a foamy discharge from their snouts. Two middle-aged men — a stablehand and a horse trainer who had reportedly tried to hand-feed the dying mare — developed flulike symptoms, too. Although the stablehand recovered, the trainer ultimately died, as did more than a dozen horses.

Scientists eventually traced the outbreak to a virus carried by fruit bats, also known as flying foxes. The bats shed the pathogen, which was named the Hendra virus, in their feces and saliva, spreading it to horses, which can then pass it on to humans. In the years since, there have been dozens of additional outbreaks in horses, and several more cases in humans.

A new study, based on 25 years of data from Australia, suggests that environmental changes have been driving these spillovers by radically altering the ecology of black flying foxes. Deforestation, coupled with climate-linked food shortages, has driven the bats into human-dominated habitats like farms, where food is readily available but may be of poorer quality, scientists reported in Nature on Wednesday.

They are born at 21,000 feet, with seasonal melts from the Sajama ice cap in Bolivia, and they are born in the dark rock of Peru’s Apacheta cliff, as glacial seepage spraying white from its pores. They are born less than 100 miles from the Pacific Ocean; they are born in the middle of the South American continent, in Brazil’s high plains, savannas and sandstone ridges. Most are just tributaries of tributaries, headwaters for much larger rivers — the Caquetá, the Madre de Dios, the Iriri, the Tapajós — any of which, on its own, would already be among the largest rivers in the world. Where these tributaries empty, just south of the Equator, they form the aorta of the Amazon proper, more than 10 miles wide at its widest point. From the Amazon’s farthest source to its mouth in the Atlantic, water flows for 4,000 miles, almost as long as the Nile. Measured by the volume it releases into the ocean — the equivalent of a dozen Mississippis, one-fifth of all the fresh water that reaches the world’s seas — the Amazon is the largest river in the world.

The consensus used to be that ecosystems are merely a product of prevailing weather patterns. But in the 1970s, the Brazilian researcher Eneas Salati proved that the Amazon, with its roughly 400 billion trees, also creates its own weather. On an average day, a single large tree releases more than 100 gallons of water as vapor. This not only lowers the air temperature through evaporative cooling; as Salati discovered by tracking oxygen isotopes in rainwater samples, it also gives rise to “flying rivers” — rain clouds that recycle the forest’s own moisture five or six times, ultimately generating as much as 45 percent of its total precipitation. By creating the conditions for a continental swath of evergreens, this process is crucial to the Amazon’s role as a global “sink” for carbon.

Many scientists now fear, however, that this virtuous cycle is breaking down. Just in the past half-century, 17 percent of the Amazon — an area larger than Texas — has been converted to croplands or cattle pasture. Less forest means less recycled rain, less vapor to cool the air, less of a canopy to shield against sunlight. Under drier, hotter conditions, even the lushest of Amazonian trees will shed leaves to save water, inhibiting photosynthesis — a feedback loop that is only exacerbated by global warming. According to the Brazilian Earth system scientist Carlos Nobre, if deforestation reaches 20 to 25 percent of the original area, the flying rivers will weaken enough that a rainforest simply will not be able to survive in most of the Amazon Basin. Instead it will collapse into scrubby savanna, possibly in a matter of decades.

Much of the evidence for this theory — including Gatti’s air-​sample studies — emerged thanks to a groundbreaking initiative led by Nobre himself. When Nobre started trying to forecast the impact of deforestation back in 1988, he had to do it at the University of Maryland, because his home country lacked the computing power for serious climate modeling. Brazil was so strapped for resources that foreign researchers even dominated Amazon fieldwork. But Nobre spearheaded a program that, in the words of a Nature editorial, “revolutionized understanding of the Amazon rainforest and its role in the Earth system.” Established in 1999 and known as the Large-​Scale Biosphere-​Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia, or L.B.A., it united disciplines that usually did not collaborate, bringing together chemists like Gatti with biologists and meteorologists. While funding mostly came from the United States and Europe, Nobre insisted that South Americans play leading roles, thus giving rise to a whole new generation of Brazilian climate scientists.

Until recently, Nobre was working under the assumption that the Amazon would not become a net source of carbon for at least another few decades. But Gatti’s research is not the only sign that, as he put it to me over Skype, “we are on the eve of this tipping point.” The rain machine is slowing. Droughts used to come once every couple of decades, with a megadrought every century or two. But just since 1998 there have been five, two of them extreme. The effect is particularly acute in the eastern Amazon, which has already lost a staggering 30 percent of its forest. The dry season there used to be three months long; now it lasts more than four. During the driest months, rainfall has declined by as much as a third in four decades, while average temperatures have risen by as much as 3.1 degrees Celsius — triple the annual increase for the world as a whole in the fossil-fuel era. In some parts, jungles are already being colonized by grasses."

The campaign could also raise the heat on domestic automakers in the middle of contract negotiations with the newly aggressive United Automobile Workers union, which is focused on raising wages at electric vehicle suppliers like battery makers.

The war’s impact goes far beyond the region. It has driven up food and energy prices worldwide, contributing to the record 349 million people experiencing food insecurity and to famine-like conditions in East Africa. The conduct of the war has flouted the most basic international laws and conventions, posing a fundamental threat to the global order. As such, it offers a textbook example of the Age of Impunity.

Impunity is the exercise of power without accountability, which becomes, in starkest form, the commission of crimes without punishment. In Ukraine this goes beyond the original invasion. It has included repeated violations of international humanitarian law, which is supposed to establish clear protections for civilians, aid workers and civilian infrastructure in conflict zones every day. The danger is that few people will ever face consequences for these crimes.

The impunity in Ukraine is only one part of a broader global trend.

Califf, the F.D.A. commissioner, said in a statement. “The draft recommendations issued today should lead to providing consumers with clear labeling to give them the information they need to make informed nutrition and purchasing decisions on the products they buy for themselves and their families.”

The F.D.A.’s guidance had been eagerly anticipated by dairy producers and the expansive plant-based food sector, which have been at loggerheads over whether the word “milk” on products that are derived from nuts and grains confuses consumers. The debate, which was kicked off four decades ago by the introduction of soy-based beverages, has taken on greater urgency amid a seismic shift in dietary habits. Products like oat milk continue to enjoy robust growth, while milk consumption has been on a downward trajectory for decades. Americans on average drink nearly half as much milk as they did in 1970, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

The growing embrace of beverages made from cashews, quinoa or flaxseed has been fueled in part by health concerns; some people buy them because they are lactose intolerant. And an increasing number of Americans cite either the desire for a vegan diet or dairy production’s contribution to climate change through the manure and methane produced by cows. Animal rights activists have sought to portray dairy farming as inherently cruel, a claim that has been rejected by the industry. For some consumers, the turn toward plant-based products is simply a matter of taste.

Executives in the plant-based food sector had been anticipating a less favorable ruling, given the skepticism expressed by one of Dr. Califf’s recent predecessors, Dr. Scott Gottlieb. In 2018, he famously declared that “an almond doesn’t lactate” — comments that suggested the agency might seek a ban on the word “milk” for nondairy beverages.

Madeline Cohen, a regulatory lawyer with the Good Food Institute, which promotes plant-derived food products, said the F.D.A.’s guidance was a welcome acknowledgment that consumers were savvy enough to know that coconut milk was not produced by lactating animals. “We know that consumers are going out and purposely buying these products,” she said. “No one is purchasing them by accident.”"

Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of the Wagner private military company who led a brief mutiny against Russia’s military leadership in June, was listed as a passenger on a plane that crashed yesterday, killing all 10 people aboard, according to Russian aviation authorities.

His fate remains unclear. Several Russian news outlets reported, citing anonymous sources, that he was indeed on the plane that crashed. But Grey Zone, a Telegram account associated with Wagner, posted that it remained uncertain whether Prigozhin was dead or alive, and U.S. officials said they were unable to confirm his death. Dmitri Utkin, Wagner’s most prominent commander, was also on the passenger manifest.

Frustrated over the country’s military leadership, Prigozhin instigated a short rebellion two months ago with his Wagner forces that posed a threat to President Vladimir Putin. Despite his actions, he appeared to move about freely in the mutiny’s aftermath, even meeting with the president on June 29.

A falling out: After years of supporting Putin, Prigozhin began to openly criticize the Russian government. Here’s what changed and when."

For decades, few people were listening. But lately, that’s beginning to change. He and his colleague Rosemary Knight of Stanford University have convinced the state’s Department of Water Resources to undertake a three-year survey to find more of them.

The big hope is that an array of paleo valleys could be turned into giant storm drains to quickly absorb heavy rain. Storm water spread over the valleys would sink underground and then move into the surrounding clays and silts, for more than 12 miles on either side of the valley and for hundreds of feet in depth, according to one study. It would raise the diminished water table, which is important because a healthier underground water system can feed rivers from below and allow people to continue to pump water from wells. It can also make more water available to plants and soil, help to sustain the rain cycle and reduce fire risk.

There is enough unmanaged surface water from rain and snow statewide to resupply Central Valley aquifers, making more water available to farmers, urban dwellers and the environment. Even with climate change, the state will most likely have enough water for recharge in the future in part because of more extreme weather, according to a 2021 study.

To use paleo valleys to store these big rains, the land above them must be conserved for groundwater recharge. And that’s already a challenge: One paleo valley found outside of Sacramento has been slated for housing developments, which would cover it with impermeable concrete and asphalt. Such decisions are typically governed by city and county governments, but the state could incentivize areas with paleo valleys to protect the land above them.

Land use isn’t the only issue. The state’s major aqueducts that move water from north to south can also play a big role in helping floodwater reach the paleo valleys. The aqueducts are underused in winter when fewer growers need to irrigate their crops and could transport excess storm water to depleted aquifers. Pipes could be added to them to move the water to the paleo valleys."

What’s Up? (April 2-8)

Surging Oil Prices

An unexpected move by Saudi Arabia, Russia and other members of OPEC Plus to cut oil production by more than 1.2 million barrels a day, or more than 1 percent of the world’s supplies, sent oil prices soaring at the beginning of the week. Last Sunday night, when energy markets opened, both the American and global oil benchmark prices rose 7 percent. The decision caught everyone off guard because in the days leading up to the announcement, officials said they did not intend to make changes to their policies. There are a few possible factors behind the cuts: Both Russia and Saudi Arabia have been struggling to keep up with production, according to recent reports. And OPEC Plus could be responding to the darkening economic outlook, made dimmer by the failure of several banks. OPEC Plus’s changes to oil production may ultimately have limited effect. Still, oil prices have fallen far from where they were a year ago in the immediate wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Slower but Steady Job Growth

Employers added 236,000 jobs in March, about what analysts expected. Recent jobs figures had blown past forecasts, showing the Federal Reserve that the path to cooling the economy would be a winding one. That point came across in last week’s jobs report as well: Despite the steep drop-off from January and February, the March job numbers still show a healthy rate of growth. But it’s clear that the job market’s strength is ebbing. Job openings dropped sharply in February and initial claims for unemployment insurance jumped, according to data released on Tuesday. The March employment data was collected before the collapse of two midsize banks, which may further slow the economy.

Twitter’s Challenge to Substack

Last week, the newsletter platform Substack unveiled Substack Notes, a new feature bearing a striking resemblance to Twitter that allows users to share links, images and whatever is on their mind. In a swift rebuke, Elon Musk, Twitter’s chief executive, on Friday appeared to block all links to Substack. The move is part of Mr. Musk’s effort to shut out his competition by restricting the use of outside links on his platform. It is also another example of how the experience of being on Twitter can change day to day, or even hour to hour, even as many of the changes Mr. Musk has carried out since buying Twitter have been largely cosmetic. Mr. Musk’s changes to the platform’s algorithm, for example, have affected which posts users see in their feeds every day. And users with blue check marks — which in the past served as identity verification for politicians, celebrities and other public figures and organizations but can now be purchased by any user — are still waiting to see if their badges disappear en masse if they don’t pay up. Mr. Musk had said that would happen last week, but it has not yet occurred for most users.

What’s Next? (April 9-15)

Almost Time to File

As tax day rapidly draws nearer — have you filed yet, reader? — the Internal Revenue Service is in the process of transforming how Americans do their taxes. On Thursday, the agency unveiled an $80 billion plan that includes transforming itself into a “digital first” tax collector that would allow Americans to file directly to the federal government at no cost. That aspect of the proposed overhaul is among its most contentious, meeting resistance from the tax preparation industry as well as Republicans in Congress, many of whom oppose any efforts to bolster the I.R.S. The agency’s critics also take issue with its plans to crack down on wealthy tax evaders. The Biden administration wants to reduce the nation’s $7 trillion of uncollected tax revenue, and use the money to fund initiatives like combating climate change and curbing prescription drug prices."

Are you a fan of science fiction? Have you read any stories or novels by Octavia Butler?

Consider two quotes from the article about her childhood in the 1950s:

Butler’s mother walked her to the library, where they signed up for a card. That small slip of paper became her passport to travel widely.

And:

She read with thirst and purpose.

What do you think the Times writer, Lynell George, means by a “passport to travel widely”? What does it mean for someone to read with “thirst and purpose”? Do either of these quotes resonate with your own experiences with books and reading?

Before reading the featured article, take some time to reflect upon the role of reading and writing in your own life. Then, in writing or through discussion with a partner, respond to these prompts:

Do you love to read? Why or why not? Have you ever read with thirst or purpose? Are you thrilled to be transported to new worlds? See yourself reflecting on others’ stories? Imagine new possibilities for yourself and the world around you?

What is your favorite reading spot? Describe it. What makes it special? How does it feel to read there?

Do you enjoy writing? Why or why not? What have been your experiences writing, in and outside of school? Are they mostly positive? Supportive?

Do you ever make up stories? Have you ever kept a journal or writing notebook? If so, why?

Has anyone ever encouraged your writing? Have you ever aspired to be a writer when you grow up?

Then, share your reflection with a partner and discuss: What do you think it takes to be a writer?

Questions for Writing and Discussion

In the featured article, read the introduction and the first section, “The beginning, 1947 — 1959: The World That Made Her.” (You will have an opportunity to read the rest of the article later in this lesson.) Then answer the questions below:

1. Who was Octavia Estelle Butler? What picture of the acclaimed writer emerges from the essay? Give at least five adjectives that you think best describe her?

2. How would you describe Butler’s childhood? Provide at least three significant facts, events or details from her childhood. Which aspects of her childhood resonate most with your own experiences growing up?

3. What role did books and libraries play in Butler’s childhood and life? How does her relationship to reading compare with personal experiences that you described in the warm-up activity?

4. How did Butler’s childhood shape her path toward becoming a writer? How did long bus rides to the Los Angeles Central Library prove “perfect for writing”?"

Note: Multi-year events are assigned to the year with peak intensity.

The study provides an emerging picture of distortions in the total amount of water both above ground and also in aquifers deep beneath the Earth’s surface, where most of the freshwater that humans depend upon comes from.

It relies on data from NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment mission, known as Grace, which uses satellites that can detect changes in gravity to measure fluctuations in water where other satellites can’t see. That way, it can provide information about locations where there are otherwise no gauges or wells.

“For most of the world, we just don’t have data on how groundwater storage is changing,” Matthew Rodell, the deputy director of earth sciences at NASA Goddard, said. “Grace sort of breaks those boundaries and provides information everywhere.”

In a paper published Monday in the journal Nature Water, Dr. Rodell and Bailing Li, an assistant research scientist at the University of Maryland, analyzed the satellite data to measure water-cycle extremes. They uncovered 505 wet and 551 dry episodes between 2002 and 2021, then assigned each one an “intensity,” in order to rank them. The intensity rankings took into account the severity of an episode as well as its duration and the amount of land area affected.

One aspect of the Grace data is that it measures changes that persist over longer periods of time. In effect it tracks slower-moving disasters that unfold over months or years, not momentary flash floods during an otherwise normal season.

Dr. Rodell and Dr. Li initially set out to rank the worst droughts and periods of increased rainfall over the past 20 years of available satellite observations. When reviewing the results, however, they soon realized both types of events were more common — and were growing more severe — toward the end of the study period.

To see if global warming could be behind the changes, the researchers compared the correlation of monthly wet and dry intensities with global average temperatures and other known climate factors.

They found that global average temperatures had a more significant correlation than the other indicators, including El Niño, the occasional shift in Pacific Ocean water temperatures that can have significant effects on heat and precipitation. The finding strengthens the possibility that, as the world warms, we’ll see more frequent and stronger extremes.

A few regions stood out. The tropics are experiencing more intense wet spells, and continental regions are seeing a trend toward drought.

However, 20 years of observations is short in terms of climate time scales. Simply looking for correlations like this “is going to be limited in its ability to tease these things apart. It’s not trivial to do,” said John Fasullo, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, who wasn’t involved in the study.

There are other limitations to the Grace data. Global measurements are monthly and are published with a delay, making it impractical for tracking events as they unfold. The data also has an effective resolution about the size of the state of Illinois, which isn’t ideal for seeing changes on a more local level.

The analysis also excludes regions known to be undergoing long-term human impacts or persistent ice melt that were identified in a previous study led by Dr. Rodell. They include California’s Central Valley, where agricultural use has depleted aquifers, and Greenland, where the ice sheet has melted.

Groundwater changes, particularly at the extremes, remains a topic in need of further study, especially to analyze the influence of global warming. But for precipitation over shorter time periods, the relationship is more clear. “One of the robustly detected aspects of water cycle extremes is the increase of intense precipitation with climate change,” said Dr. Fasullo."

And with cities still reconfiguring themselves in the wake of the pandemic, the case for rethinking their purpose and potential could not be more urgent. We need to make urban areas more walkable, more fun and more livable, to be sure. But we should also make them greener. The city must be not just a place of wealth generation, culture and activity, but also a unique ecosystem that offers us protection against climate threats and a vital, visceral connection with wildlife.

Among the first to document the exuberance of urban ecosystems were casual observers and curious botanists in war-torn Europe in the 1940s. The rubble-strewn cities of World War II, to the astonishment of their inhabitants, very quickly brimmed with plant and animal life. The vegetation that emerged from the debris was totally unexpected, a cornucopia of exotic, often nonnative species that were adept at exploiting and thriving in the damage. Blitzed areas of London brimmed with pink swaths of rosebay willow herb — “bombweed,” as it was nicknamed. In central Münster, Germany, piles of rubble were veiled with spontaneously growing pussy willow, mountain maple, birches, yellow mulleins and wild strawberry.

These disaster-loving plants often evolved on coastal cliffs, arid mountainsides and other inhospitable places: pioneers of nature that reclaimed scarred territory and prepared the way for larger shrubs and woody species. They had come to the city accidentally over the centuries, concealed in shipping containers or as hitchhikers on the tires of vehicles and the soles of boots. And they had been there, biding their time, until the destruction of war allowed them to run riot and make bombed-out cities look amazingly verdant. They became the key components of a distinctively novel and amazingly diverse urban ecosystem.

It was in West Berlin in the 1950s that urban ecology became a science. One of its earliest pioneers, the botanist Herbert Sukopp, noted that the city’s ecology was in continual flux as nature responded to changes in the human-made environment. Neglected sites were profuse in biodiversity, often containing many more species of plants and insects than nearby parks or even the countryside.

Today in Berlin, a patch of wildness called the Natur-Park Südgelände has bloomed in what was once among the city’s busiest railroad yards. Like the Great Trinity Forest, first it was abandoned and then hundreds of species took over, many of them endangered. But in contrast to Trinity, its wildness is now carefully stewarded. Elevated metal walkways give visitors access without disturbing rare flowers and ground-nesting birds; pockets of precious grassland and meadow flowers are protected by mowing and grazing sheep."

The budget contains some $5 trillion in proposed tax increases on high earners and corporations over a decade, much of which would offset new spending programs aimed at the middle class and the poor. It seeks to reduce budget deficits by nearly $3 trillion over that time, compared with the country’s current path.

It reaffirms Mr. Biden’s case that he can prevent the growing debt burden from weighing on the economy while expanding spending and protecting popular safety-net programs — almost entirely by asking companies and the wealthy to pay more in taxes.

But after claiming credit for a $1.7 trillion decline in the annual deficit over the past year, Mr. Biden now sees the deficit increasing again in the 2024 fiscal year, to $1.8 trillion. The jump is larger than other forecasters, like the Congressional Budget Office, have projected. It is driven by rising costs of servicing the national debt as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to curb inflation and by new programs the president is proposing that are not fully offset by tax increases in their first year."

Societies need to plan for aging, and they’re not well set up to do so. It’s not an in-your-face crisis — it’s a slow-rolling crisis.

Older people in Asia are often in good physical health. What about their mental health?

Mental health is a huge problem. Some people die alone, as my colleague Norimitsu Onishi wrote a few years ago. People have fewer children than they used to. Those children move to cities, and are not in a position to take care of their parents who are left behind in depopulating areas. So old people are living in isolation.

Other than older people working longer, what are some potential solutions?

Bringing in workers from other countries seems to be the only solution, but Japan is notoriously opposed to immigration. A few years ago it changed its laws to allow some workers, but the parameters were strict and it didn’t have a major impact.

Japan is not the only country in the region struggling with this. Last year in China, deaths outnumbered births for the first time in six decades. How is China dealing with its aging population?

China has been scrambling to forestall the decline by ending its one-child policy and encouraging families to have more children, including — like in Japan — the subsidizing of assisted reproductive technology, in the hopes that it will spur more births."

As the sun went down, one placed the cap of his bottle on the ground, pouring in a precious portion of water for a stray cat who slinked toward him. The men, who were Darfuris, explained that they had escaped what they called a new genocide in Sudan. They saw militants burning homes, sometimes entire villages, and ran for their lives.

There are dozens — maybe hundreds — of Sudanese currently staying in that park in Sfax, and thousands across the city. They sleep on cardboard, or mattresses if they’re lucky. They contemplate their fates, chatting quietly about their experiences and wondering where they can get food. Mostly, they wait: for money from relatives or friends, or for work that might enable them to raise 2,000 Tunisian dinars, or $647, to buy a spot on a boat and a chance at escape. Everyone I met in Sfax, which is about 80 miles from the Italian island of Lampedusa, wanted to cross the Mediterranean to Europe. They all knew they might die in the attempt.

Even so, people leave every day. Some send jubilant messages from Italy; others wash up dead along the coast. The weekend I sat in the park, as many as three ships sank, leaving more than 80 people dead or missing. Ten bodies were found on beaches nearby. Last week, 41 people were reported to have died after a shipwreck off the Italian coast.

Mass death has long been normalized on Europe’s borders. More than 27,800 people have died or disappeared in the Mediterranean Sea since 2014 — and that is most likely a large underestimate. This year is shaping up to be especially deadly. Over 2,000 people have lost their lives trying to get to Europe, including more than 600 who died when a ship capsized off the coast of Greece in June. This is what a crisis of human rights, ethics and, above all, global inequality looks like."

That April, the Europeans asserted jurisdiction using a novel theory, asserting that the combination would stifle innovation in the European Union even though Grail does no business in the bloc. As a result, a matter of potentially significant importance to the U.S. health care industry — including how quickly Americans can get cutting- edge cancer detection technology — landed in the hands of the Europeans, who then concluded that the merger should be unwound. Illumina is appealing that decision.

The F.T.C. has not questioned the European Union’s unprecedented power grab. European action is likely to provide results that are more in line with the F.T.C.’s agenda than the F.T.C. could achieve on its own here. Americans should know whether this outsourcing of authority was intentional or just a series of coincidences. We are skeptical, in part because the F.T.C. is not alone in outsourcing. (An F.T.C. spokesman said the agency “regularly and lawfully coordinates with international partners, as it has for decades under both Republican and Democratic chairs” but never outsources its authority. He added that regulators make their own “independent judgments “when a deal appears blatantly anticompetitive.”)

Similarly, the Securities and Exchange Commission’s recent proposal to require public companies to publish extensive emissions data and disclose information about the climate risks they face, even if irrelevant from an investment perspective, is based on E.U. requirements. The S.E.C. claims that conforming to the European financial regulations — rules based on directives of the European Parliament and intended to drive social objectives — is a laudable goal. In doing so, the S.E.C. is effectively seeking to import European energy and climate policy.

The Federal Reserve and other financial regulators face virtually constant pressure from members of Congress and international bodies to import similar, sweeping E.U. regulations regarding banking, insurance and asset management. Our financial regulators have no constitutional authority or ability to set our energy and climate policy; they certainly cannot do so by deference to the Europeans.

If these were isolated examples of abdication of regulatory authority to Europe, we might shrug it off. They are not. Our regulators are all too often deferring to foreign counterparts, citing euphemisms like “international cooperation” and “global regulatory harmonization” while paying short shrift to their obligation to consider domestic consequences in accordance with our laws."

President Biden and Vladimir Putin, the leaders of the U.S. and Russia, laid out radically different visions for Ukraine’s future yesterday, offering contrasting narratives about who is to blame for the bloody, yearlong war. They seemed to agree on only one point: The conflict is nowhere near an end.

Biden repeatedly blamed Putin for dragging Europe back to brutality and warfare on a scale not seen since World War II. He accused the Russian leader of wide-ranging atrocities and called on the world to stand up to him and other “tyrants.” Putin blamed the U.S. and its allies for turning the conflict into a “global confrontation.” He announced a suspension of Russia’s participation in its last remaining nuclear treaty with America.

The speeches came as many European leaders were wondering whether they would be able to sustain the current level of spending on arms, government support and humanitarian aid to Ukraine. Biden has vowed that the U.S. and its NATO allies will remain steadfast. “Our support for Ukraine will not waver, NATO will not be divided, and we will not tire,” he said.

Analysis: The suspension of Russia’s participation in the New START nuclear treaty is the latest sign that the decades-long era of formal arms control may be dying, writes David E. Sanger, a White House and national security correspondent for The Times."

He will have to weigh how he can best placate the various factions of the Democratic conference. Chairmanships are not at stake, but the process will determine who Mr. Jeffries decides to embolden.

The Squad and their allies loom. In a recent Instagram stream, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said she was taking stock of the tactics employed by the hard right. “I’m not gonna lie, some of the points that are made — I mean a lot of them are bad, most of them are bad — but some of them, there is actually some common ground on,” she said. “Like for example, democratizing the rules of the House and kind of breaking up that concentration of power that is so focused in a handful of leaders in both parties.”

Mr. Jeffries’s long-running hostility to the party’s left flank may soon be thrown into much sharper relief. Nancy Pelosi evolved from a die-hard liberal who once backed single-payer health care into a more calculating, center-left party leader. Mr. Jeffries will probably need to migrate left if he hopes to successfully manage a caucus that is bound to grow more restive.

Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, Cori Bush, Ayanna Pressley and Jamaal Bowman never came close to seriously imperiling Ms. Pelosi’s speakership. There’s no doubt that the right-wing Republicans under Mr. McCarthy will enjoy comparatively more clout, gaining the ability to force snap votes on Mr. McCarthy’s future and infiltrating the powerful Rules Committee. Disobedience was worthwhile: The new speaker will be the weakest in modern times.

Mr. Jeffries, though, may not always enjoy Pelosi-style deference from the rank-and-file, including the hard left. Ms. Pelosi was the first female speaker of the House, a seminal political figure with an enormous fund-raising operation, the very personification of coastal liberalism. She frustrated the left, but also opposed the Iraq War, killed George W. Bush’s plan to privatize Social Security and was a critical force in shepherding the Affordable Care Act into law.

Radioactive residue has left Bikini uninhabitable to this day, forcing those whose families once lived on the atoll into exile on a handful of other Marshallese islands and in the United States.

Recognizing the damage its testing caused, the U.S. government established two trust funds in the 1980s to help pay for Bikinians’ health care, build housing and cover living costs. In 2017, after a campaign by Bikini leaders for greater autonomy, the Trump administration announced that the government would lift withdrawal limits and stop auditing the main fund, then worth $59 million.

Six years later, only about $100,000 remains, and the Bikini community is in crisis.

And business investment, while far less sensitive to tax rates than legend has it, is very responsive to demand.

And so we’re having a huge manufacturing revival.

Now, there’s a risk that what I’m saying may come across as too uncritically upbeat. So let me offer two major caveats about the Biden manufacturing boom.

First, even if we do have a major manufacturing revival, we’re not going back to 1970, when more than a quarter of U.S. workers were in manufacturing. We’re still going to be overwhelmingly a service economy despite these new policies. The new manufacturing boom may help lagging regions in the U.S. heartland and is specifically designed to help workers without college degrees. But nobody should expect it to turn back the clock on our transition to a postindustrial society.

Second, rapid growth in a sector isn’t necessarily a good thing for the economy. Until recently, for example, there was an explosion of resources devoted to Bitcoin mining. As far as I can tell, these resources produced nothing of value — sorry, crypto enthusiasts, Bitcoin has yet to show that it’s useful for anything besides money laundering. And the Bitcoin boom has both inflicted environmental damage and consumed resources that could have been used to produce things that are actually useful.

So why should we consider Biden’s industrial-policy-driven manufacturing boom a good thing? Mainly because it’s part of an urgently needed transition to renewable energy that may be our last chance to avoid climate catastrophe. And the surge in U.S. manufacturing investment in particular partly reflects protectionist aspects of the legislation that are a bad thing in terms of economic efficiency — but were essential to the political deal-making that made it possible to tackle climate change at all."

That means turning huge areas of land over to solar farms, wind turbines and geothermal systems. It means building the transmission lines to move that energy from where it’s made to where it’s needed. It means dotting the landscape with enough electric vehicle charging stations to make the state’s proposed ban on cars with internal combustion engines possible. Taken as a whole, it’s a construction task bigger than anything the state has ever attempted, and it needs to be completed at a speed that nothing in the state’s recent history suggests is possible.

California has become notorious not for what it builds but for what it fails to build. And Newsom knows it. “I watched as a mayor and then a lieutenant governor and now governor as years became decades on high-speed rail,” he said. “People are losing trust and confidence in our ability to build big things. People look at me all the time and ask, ‘What the hell happened to the California of the ’50s and ’60s?’”

But Newsom’s immediate problem is the Biden administration. Because it, too, has become focused on how difficult it has become to build — and not just in California. “These delays are pervasive at every level of government — federal, state and local,” John Podesta, a senior adviser to President Biden on clean energy, said in a speech last month. “We got so good at stopping projects that we forgot how to build things in America.”

The Biden administration is pumping hundreds of billions of dollars into decarbonization. And it wants to make sure it gets a return on that money. So it’s making states compete for federal grants, and one way it’s judging them is on whether the state has made it easy to build. That has become an issue for California."

But the American political system wasn’t built to make radical change easy. Yes, our political system needs a major overhaul, but such an overhaul is almost inconceivable given current political constraints.

This can be a bracing reality when youthful idealism crashes into it.

The knot that the country finds itself in may be one reason Pew found that younger voters are the least likely to believe that voting can have at least some effect on the country’s future direction.

And yet, according to a poll this spring of 18- to 29-year-olds by the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School, they’re still engaged. As John Della Volpe, the director of polling at the institute and the author of “Fight: How Gen Z is Channeling Their Fear and Passion to Save America,” put it, “From the midterms through the recent Wisconsin Supreme Court election, we are seeing young Americans increasingly motivated to engage in politics out of sheer self-defense and a responsibility to fight for those even more vulnerable than themselves.”

This defensive posture is understandable when you think about the political era in which these younger voters came of age: a dizzying period of dysfunction, calamity and activism."

Jack Ethredge could see the future. It was 1985, and Mr. Ethredge, then the city manager of Thornton, Colo., understood that sooner or later, the Denver suburb would need more water.

The population was booming, businesses were flocking to the Mountain West, and Thornton had no major lakes or rivers of its own, nor any meaningful amount of groundwater to draw upon, a fluke of geology and geography. The city had drilled a dozen or so wells over the years, but the groundwater’s limited supply and high mineral content meant it wasn’t fit for drinking.

So at Mr. Ethredge’s behest, Thornton went shopping. The City Council bought about 17,000 acres of farmland 60 miles to the north, near Fort Collins, along with the associated water rights. When the time was right, Thornton would divert the water from the Cache la Poudre River that irrigated that farmland, put it in a pipeline and send it downstate.

“In the water business you have to be years and years ahead of the game,” Mr. Ethredge, now retired, said in an interview.

In theory, Thornton’s water woes were solved. In practice, the problems were just beginning. Today, almost 40 years later, the water Mr. Ethredge secured for his city remains out of reach.

Plans to build the pipeline have been stymied by bureaucracy, lawsuits and ferocious debates over who is entitled to use the snowmelt from the Rocky Mountains.

Jack Ethredge, Thornton’s former city manager.

Across the country, tensions over water are mounting as climate change, drought and development strain an increasingly scarce natural resource. The aquifers that supply 90 percent of the nation’s drinking water are being severely depleted. Housing and other uses like agriculture are draining finite supplies of groundwater. And counties and cities are being forced to hunt for new sources of water, setting up clashes between neighboring communities.

Another proposed pipeline in Colorado that would have brought water from the San Luis Valley to Douglas County ran into fierce resistance from lawmakers in Denver and was abandoned. In Texas, the city of San Antonio built a 150 mile pipeline to bolster its water supply, only to leave residents in the rural area where aquifers were being tapped complaining that their wells were running dry. And in Thornton, there is no end in sight to the pipeline battle.

“It’s a classic economic problem,” said Jeni Arndt, the mayor of Fort Collins. “How do you distribute a scarce and shrinking resource when there’s growing demand?”

After years of legal rancor, most of Thornton’s neighbors grudgingly agree that the city has a legal right to the water from up north. But no one can agree on precisely how Thornton should access it, and a fight is raging over the city’s plans to move that water down to the Denver suburbs. With the pipeline stalled, Thornton is forced to limit its growth, with all kinds of negative fallout.

City officials recently told a fast-growing company that makes a meat alternative using mushrooms that it had to pause expansion plans for lack of water. A major affordable housing project is on hold for the same reason. In total, the city says 18,000 housing units, which could accommodate about 54,000 people, are not being built because the pipeline is tied up in red tape.

Drilling for groundwater isn’t an easy option, either. The city’s few wells have produced a consistent but small amount of non-potable water that is used to irrigate parks and other public spaces. But the water level in one monitoring well in Thornton has fallen by about 100 feet since measurements began, and other wells in the Denver Basin aquifer system have had similar drops in the past few decades.

“It’s frustrating,” said Brett Henry, Thornton’s executive director for infrastructure. “We’ve had the engineering solutions all along, but we’ve got these political problems getting in the way. It doesn’t add up.”

Back when Mr. Ethredge secured the water rights up north, Thornton planners figured they would need that water by 2000. But a series of conservation measures and the construction of new reservoirs in the 1990s held off that deadline for more than a decade.

During those years, Thornton also overcame the first legal obstacles around its plan. Fort Collins and other cities and water districts sued Thornton, arguing it couldn’t move water that was currently used for agricultural purposes downstream to be used for municipal needs, a process derisively called “buy and dry” by critics. The Colorado Supreme Court ultimately decided in Thornton’s favor, appearing to clear the way for the construction of a pipeline.

Then, about a decade ago, it became clear Mr. Ethredge’s prediction was coming true. Thornton’s population had expanded by nearly 50 percent, from less than 100,000 residents in 2000 to about 150,000 today, and water supplies were getting tight. If the city was going to continue to grow, it would need to tap its reserves up north.

So in 2014, Mr. Ethredge, who was still city manager at the time, began working with the new City Council to develop plans for a pipeline that would carry water directly from the Poudre River to Thornton, bypassing the farms that had relied on that water for decades.

In nearby Weld County, construction began. About seven of the planned 72 miles have now been built, at a cost of about $20 million.

But in Larimer County, home to Fort Collins and some of the land that Thornton owns, the resistance was immediate.

“Of course I don’t want it here,” said Barry Feldman, who owns a restored ranch house on an expansive property where he keeps horses. “They will have to spend time digging, disrupting our lives, and there’s the possibility of repairs. Go bother someone else.”

Mr. Feldman, an active member of an opposition group called No Pipe Dream, said he believed Thornton had a right to access the water. But he doesn’t want the pipeline in his backyard.

Other opponents said they, too, were fine with Thornton accessing the water, but they wanted it to run down the Poudre River, where it could help revitalize an ecosystem long taxed by the region’s agriculture, then be put into a pipeline many miles downstream.

“We have one single mission, which is to protect and restore,” said Gary Wockner, an environmentalist and the founder of another opposition group, Save the Poudre, as he walked along the river bank in downtown Fort Collins. “We’re not trying to stop them from getting their water, we’re not trying to stop growth.”

But letting pristine snowmelt blend into the Poudre River and flow past urban areas and farmland, where it would mix with wastewater runoff, fertilizers and other contaminants before it would reach Thornton, was not acceptable to Mr. Henry and other city officials. The pipeline, they said, was the only viable option, and Thornton went ahead with plans for construction.

In 2018, under relentless pressure from the public, Larimer County officials denied Thornton the permits to build the pipeline, saying that the plans for the route were not specific enough.

Thornton sued Larimer County, seeking to override its objections. But a district court and an appeals court ruled in favor of Larimer. Last year, Thornton said it would not appeal to the state Supreme Court.

Instead, Mr. Henry and his team have gone back to the drawing board and are working on a new, more detailed route for the pipeline. They expect to submit new plans in late September.

In the meantime, Thornton businesses are fuming. Late last year, the Home Builders Association of Metro Denver published an open letter calling for a swift resolution that would let Thornton access its water.

“By refusing to allow Thornton to access the water it has owned for nearly 40 years, Larimer County is impacting the livelihood and ability for families and individuals to live closer to where they work and inadvertently exacerbating Colorado’s housing attainability crisis,” wrote Ted Leighty, the group’s chief executive.

Maiker Housing Partners, a real estate developer, has suspended its plans to erect hundreds of units of affordable housing near a newly opened commuter rail station in Thornton.

“Thornton staff has informed Maiker that no new residential projects will be able to start construction until the water issue is fully resolved,” Peter LiFari, Maiker’s chief executive, said in a statement.

If the pipeline is built and the water from the Poudre starts flowing to Thornton, city officials say the city’s population could expand to 242,000 in the decades to come, from about 150,000 now.

Meati, the plant-based food company that Thornton officials said could not expand, declined to say how that was impacting its business strategy. But the company said it was trying to conserve water.

“We take conservation and sustainability seriously, and we have designed a purpose-built production system that minimizes reliance on, and efficiently uses, precious resources including water,” Christina Ra, a Meati spokeswoman, said in an email. “We are confident in our ability to scale.”

Roger Uthmann, a rancher, said he was at peace with the prospect of Thornton diverting water.

City officials are working to conserve water. During the winter, Thornton uses about 13 million gallons of tap water per day. That spikes to more than 40 million gallons a day during the summer, largely because of people watering their lawns with water that is suitable for drinking, a number Thornton is working to reduce.

“All of the western states need to realize that water is too precious to be throwing away on your lawn,” Mr. Henry said.

Thornton officials say that were it not for activists like Mr. Feldman and Mr. Wockner, they would have had their water by now.

Adding to the frustrations in Thornton is the fact that, according to Mr. Henry, the city has been a good steward of its land up north. Thornton has three full-time employees who manage the 17,000 acres, which are currently leased to farmers and ranchers. And while local governments are not required to pay taxes, Thornton has voluntarily paid millions of dollars in local taxes to Larimer County over the years.

Roger Uthmann, one of the ranchers who currently leases Thornton’s land, said he was at peace with the prospect of the city diverting the water to municipal use. “They bought it fair and square,” said Mr. Uthmann. “I don’t have a problem with that.”

Thornton officials said they were confident they would eventually prevail in their quest to run a pipeline from the Poudre down to the outskirts of Denver, although it could take many more years. They have yet to win over residents of Larimer County. As delays drag on, costs go up. The pipeline’s price tag is now expected to exceed $500 million.

But even if they finally achieve their goal, with climate change heating the West and aquifers running dry, it may not be enough to slake the thirst of a ballooning population.

“This is never going to be wrapped up,” Mr. Ethredge said. “Water is something that, in Colorado, you can’t do once and forget. You have to do it all the time.”"

Power outages have become increasingly common, as the electric grids strain under the pressure of extreme weather events, such as heat waves and cold snaps. As the alternative energy correspondent for The New York Times, I follow the new technologies that consumers use to keep the lights on during these moments, which are becoming more frequent because of climate change.

A once unlikely backup source recently caught my attention: cars. A small number of Americans use the batteries in their electric vehicles to power their homes during an outage. Energy and auto experts told me they expected the method to catch on.

My editor on the Business desk and I had long discussed doing an article about homeowners on this cutting edge. And as heat waves began smothering much of the Southern United States earlier this summer, the time seemed right. Extreme heat during recent years has caused power failures and forced occasional rolling blackouts to save electricity.

I’m based in Los Angeles, in part because California has become a hub for clean energy technologies. But for our article, which was published last week, we wanted to see how alternative energy technology was being used in other areas of the United States. We picked Nashville, a place not known for electric vehicles, home batteries or solar panels."

“No one got everything they wanted, but the American people got what they needed,” he said. He added that “we protected important priorities from Social Security to Medicare to Medicaid to veterans to our transformational investments in infrastructure and clean energy.”

Where are you from?

For most of us, the answer is automatic, and personal. I’m from Galveston. You might be from Poughkeepsie. But anyone with a little knowledge of human origins knows the deeper answer for every human on the planet: Africa.

The story of humans, who rose from a position in nature as fairly unexceptional primates to becoming the world’s dominant species — and a threat to planetary survival — is vast and complicated and uncomfortable.

How in the world could you explain all that to kids?

Yuval Noah Harari has taken on the challenge.

Harari, the author of the 2015 best seller “Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,” is not timid. In “Sapiens,” he guided readers through a sweeping tour of revolutions in human development, including the development of cognition, of agriculture and of science. That book garnered praise from Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and Barack Obama (who called it “interesting and provocative”).

Since that first blazing success, Harari has expanded the project through Sapienship, the multidisciplinary organization he founded with his husband, Itzik Yahav, in 2019. There is the multivolume “Sapiens: A Graphic History,” and a coming “Sapiens Live,” billed as “an immersive experience inspired by the works of Yuval Noah Harari.” And there is the book before us, UNSTOPPABLE US: How Humans Took Over the World (Bright Matter Books, 208 pp., $24.99, ages 10 to 14), the first of four planned volumes."

U.S. officials have advised the Ukrainians to revise their tactics. Without a dramatic move, one American official said, the pace of the counteroffensive is unlikely to change. Three months in, there are signs that the Ukrainians may be taking the advice to heart as casualties mount.

In a video teleconference this month, top Western military officials urged Ukraine’s most senior military commander, Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, to focus on one main front. According to two officials briefed on the call, General Zaluzhnyi agreed."

When was the last time real people on the internet declined to tell you what they really think?

I started talking to ChatGPT a couple of weeks ago, after the artificial intelligence company OpenAI released the bot as a “research preview” of its work on large language models. A language model is an A.I. system that has been trained on enormous troves of text to find the probabilistic connection between words; ChatGPT is a language model that has been optimized to create what’s long been the holy grail in artificial intelligence research — a computer with which you can hold a conversation.

ChatGPT certainly achieves that. I have spoken to lots of computers in my lifetime (weird flex, I know), but ChatGPT is the first that I’ve found fun and interesting to talk to. I began by peppering it with simple trivia but it wasn’t long before we were holding surprisingly nuanced conversations about, among many other things, the role of the Federal Reserve in the American economy; the nature of consciousness; neologisms like “woke” and “Karen”; ethical quandaries in parenting; how to support one’s striking colleagues; climate change, abortion and vaccine safety; and whether or not a hot dog is a sandwich."

That is mainly because the dynamics of environmental crime in the Amazon have changed in the past decade and the tactics used in the past by the federal agencies — satellite data and the deployment of federal agents — might provide limited results.

Deforestation is now being driven by criminal networks that conduct sophisticated schemes to hide the illegal origins of commodities like beef, gold and timber from the Amazon and sell them on international markets. A 2022 study by the Igarapé Institute, a Brazilian think tank, found that though the “cluster of converging crimes” varies in each Amazonian region, it often involves violence, corruption, financial crimes and fraud.

Some multinational companies have agreed to shun soy and beef produced in deforested areas, and the European Union is preparing to adopt a regulation that will force companies to prove that their goods have not led to deforestation and forest degradation. But China — a top buyer of Brazilian soy, beef and leather — has remained silent. To save the jungle, Mr. Lula must persuade Beijing to set guidelines to ensure the traceability of products from soy and cattle suppliers in Brazil."

And finally, restoring an American icon.

Tens of millions of bison once roamed the U.S. in vast, uninhabited prairies. But the animals — often referred to as buffalo, though they are not the same species — nearly disappeared after a surge in commercial hunting and other elimination efforts.

However, for the past two decades a nonprofit has been working to restore a fully functioning wild, shortgrass prairie in remote areas of Montana, complete with herds of bison thundering across the landscape. The project has also replenished other native species, like river otters, prairie dogs and wolves — all of which have diminished or been eliminated from U.S. prairies.

Have a recuperative night.

When bears wriggle against bark, the tree scratching posts leak out resins and saps. These substances stick to fur and skin , and are water-resistant, making them a strong contender for an effective tick repellent.

Agnieszka Sergiel, a bear biologist at the Polish Academy of Sciences and an author of the study published last month in the Journal of Zoology, said animals seldom engage in complex behaviors such as rubbing against trees for a single reason.

“We see plenty of examples among mammals using self-medication,” she said. So, she and her colleagues decided to study whether rubbing against trees could protect bears against parasites."

Rescuers along the central California coast struggled to keep up as they captured the sick animals in the hopes of saving them. Already, hundreds of sea lions and dozens of dolphins had died.

The marine mammals — considered “sentinel” species because of what they tell humans about the health of the ocean — are believed to be falling sick from a scourge of harmful algae that occur naturally but can be made worse by human activity.

The algae, Pseudo-nitzschia, produces a neurotoxin called domoic acid, which makes its way up the food chain from anchovies to sea lions and dolphins, causing lethargy, disorientation, vomiting, bulging eyes, muscle spasms, seizures and, in severe cases, death. The animals are appearing, sick and beached, along the shoreline from Santa Barbara to San Luis Obispo County.

Rescuers say it is among the worst mass poisoning events they’ve ever seen. And it’s only June.

“It’s been really sad,” said Michelle Berman Kowalewski, a biologist and the director of the Channel Islands Cetacean Research Unit, a nonprofit that has been responding to the beached dolphins. Algal blooms are not uncommon, but Ms. Berman Kowalewski said that, even in a bad year, she might respond to 30 to 40 poisoned dolphins. “This year, we have been averaging about 10 animals a day for 10 days,” she said."
545,Is getting your driver’s license a big deal where you live? What does it mean to you?,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/22/learning/how-important-to-you-is-being-able-to-drive.html,"{'main': 'How Important to You Is Being Able to Drive?', 'kicker': 'Student Opinion', 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': None, 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],2023-02-22T10:00:19+0000,"{'original': 'By Natalie Proulx', 'person': [{'firstname': 'Natalie', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': 'Proulx', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",705,"Do you have your driver’s license? If not, are you excited to get it someday? Or does being able to drive not mean that much to you?

In “The First Car,” an article from a series about young people coming of age and the spaces where they create community, Remy Tumin writes about the magic of finally being able to drive on your own:

The ability to get behind the wheel of a car for the first time and go anywhere is a distinct American rite of passage. For many young people, their first car grants them a freedom to explore their city on an intimate level, with their windows down and music blasting — and away from the prying eyes of parents. It can be a means to escape monotony and fear — especially during the height of the pandemic — and a gathering space where they can let it all go. The photographer Adali Schell, 21, grew up in Los Angeles and spent last summer documenting the members of his creative community in their cars. In interviews conducted over the fall, they spoke about the joy of getting behind the wheel, creating a space of safety and curiosity for themselves and their fears about the future — including the increasingly damaging effects of climate change. Finding a place to belong “feels so scarce” in L.A., Adali said. But in the confines of an old Mercedes-Benz (now powered by vegetable oil), a former taxi cab, a beat-up Volvo and a “mom” car, this group of artists and students found “a stronger sense of self and sense of security.” “It’s hard to find a home away from home, especially if you’re trying to find yourself or if you’re in a toxic living situation or whatever the situation might be,” said Adali. “The car is a remedy for a lot of those things. It’s both a thing that can take you somewhere and a thing that could really protect you.” Driving around on her own for the first time was exhilarating, Keni Titus, 21, said. “It’s so interesting to be in charge, like, oh my God, if we want to go through the drive-through, we can go.”

The article continues:

Kali Flanagan, 18, just got his license a few months ago. “I think a lot of people my age feel a lot of pent-up energy,” he said. “For one thing, the world is just overstimulating, especially with technology.” “It’s really hard nowadays, especially with social media. Everything is about branding yourself.” The car has become his escape pod — a place of safety and a doorway to endless possibilities. “There’s this sense of freedom and lack of supervision, and then the actual speed that you’re going with the windows down and the loud music and the collection of your friends.”

Students, read the entire article, then tell us:

What was your first car? Or, what would you like to have as your first car? Describe either car in detail.

Ms. Tumin writes, “The ability to get behind the wheel of a car for the first time and go anywhere is a distinct American rite of passage.” Do you agree? Is getting your driver’s license a big deal where you live? Why or why not?

The young people interviewed for this article shared what being able to drive meant to them: freedom, safety, belonging, independence, escape. What, if anything, does being able to drive mean to you?

The Washington Post reports that young people today are getting their driver’s licenses at lower rates than those in previous generations. Have you noticed this trend among your peers? Are teenagers not that excited to drive? If so, why do you think that might be?

What is a favorite memory you have of driving, whether by yourself or with your friends?

Overall, how important is being able to drive to you? Why?

He wants to expand the extraction of climate-warming natural gas; she opposes it and is pushing a congestion pricing plan to help reduce emissions in New York City. He is pushing to reverse criminal justice reforms that he says are spurring more crime; she mostly stands by the spirit of those laws. And though they have both vowed to make New York more affordable, their proposals have little overlap."

This season, M.L.B. introduced major rule changes: a pitch clock limiting the time that a pitcher has to throw a pitch and a hitter has to be ready for pitches, a ban on the infield shift where outfielders had moved around the field to be in better position to field hits, and a limit on pickoff throws for outs by the pitcher. In addition, bases are bigger (18 inches square, from 15) and pitchers and catchers may wear PitchCom transmitters to communicate secretly while on the field.

Mr. Farley sounded pessimistic about the chances of agreeing on a contract soon. “They are not negotiating in good faith if they are proposing deals that they know are going to crater our investments,” he said.

Mr. Fain’s decision to shut down just three factories is a departure for the union, which in previous strikes typically walked out of all the factories of a single automaker. By interrupting production of some of the most profitable vehicles, while allowing most plants to keep operating, the union hopes to inflict pain on the carmakers while allowing most of its members to continue collecting paychecks.

But it may be difficult for the union to limit the damage to its members’ incomes. Ford told workers at a facility in Michigan, who were not on strike, to stay home Friday because of parts shortages caused by the strike. G.M. said it would probably lay off 2,000 workers at a factory in Kansas next week because of a lack of parts produced at the factory near St. Louis that is on strike.

Fewer than 10 percent of the nearly 150,000 U.A.W. members at the three companies are on strike. Limited strikes could allow the union to maintain the pressure longer by preserving its strike fund of $825 million. The union will pay striking workers $500 a week and cover their health insurance premiums."

Gina Raimondo, the secretary of commerce, said the supply chain agreement would deepen America’s economic cooperation with partners in the Indo-Pacific region, helping American companies do business there and making the United States more competitive globally.

The song has already ignited a minor controversy around the identity of its elusive vocalist, credited onscreen as “Ms. Biljana Electronica.” We got to the bottom of things in an interview with Gordon on Thursday.

In the initial video, filmed inside the World Trade Center’s Oculus, the chorus of the song is lip-synced onscreen by an actress and content creator named Audrey Trullinger. But then, a plot twist: On Thursday, Gordon posted a second video in which Trullinger was replaced with Mara Olney, another content creator."

Andrew Kramer, our Kyiv bureau chief, and Mauricio Lima, a photographer, recently traveled to Bakhmut, the site of one of the longest and bloodiest battles in Russia’s war in Ukraine. Ukraine’s military is determined to defend the devastated city, even though allies question the cost.

After 10 months of fighting, Ukraine has lost ground inside the city. Its soldiers have been pushed into a shrinking half-circle of ruins that is only about 20 blocks wide. It continually deploys small units in close-range urban combat, sustaining significant casualties. Ukrainian soldiers said they were often close enough to hear Russians talking in nearby buildings.

One commander, who was interviewed in a basement bunker, said his soldiers were engaging in about 15 firefights at close range every day. He said his units were short on artillery shells, tank rounds and rocket-propelled grenades: “We pay with our lives for the lack of ammunition.”

Thousands of Ukrainian soldiers are also defending an access road that is still passable. The route allows Ukraine to resupply and to evacuate the wounded from Bakhmut. But it’s an eerie trip: Travelers pass the hulks of blown-up and burned trucks that didn’t make it."

Most of the Democratic incumbents locked in competitive races are more moderate members from competitive swing districts outside New York City that largely lean Democratic, but are at play this cycle because of the favorable political climate for Republicans.

As the party in power, Democrats have raked in millions of dollars in contributions from unions, businesses and other special interests seeking to shape legislation, allowing them to significantly outspend Republicans and mount vigorous campaigns to defend some of their most vulnerable incumbents.

But it remains to be seen whether that fund-raising edge will be enough to overcome a political climate that some concerned lawmakers have described as potentially calamitous for Democrats, even in a solidly liberal state like New York where Democrats outnumber Republicans more than two to one. That has raised the specter of unforeseen upsets just two years after Democrats had secured the largest majority in state history.

“History on this stuff is pretty clear: It’s a tough year when you’re in charge, and it’s a midterm election,” said State Senator Michael Gianaris, the Democratic deputy majority leader. “I would be perfectly happy to have the second largest majority in the history of the state, even if it’s a little bit smaller than what we currently have.”"

Her curiosity pulled the thread of a more than 150-year-long case of mistaken identity, resulting in a clearer picture of what the Baltic amber forest of Northern Europe looked like more than 33 million years ago.

The preserved flower bloomed about halfway between the extinction of the last non-bird dinosaurs and the evolution of humans, who found it in the 19th century in territory that is now part of Russia. In 1872, scientists classified it as Stewartia kowalewskii, an extinct flowering evergreen.

Despite all its hard work, the species known as Castor canadensis, or the North American beaver, commands too little respect. Commonly depicted as a pest that causes flooding where humans don’t want it, the beaver has a squat, rounded physique and herbivorous buck teeth that make it look decidedly less imposing than a wolf or a bald eagle. Even in Canada, where it is the country’s official animal, it was derided on the floor of Parliament as a “dentally defective rat.”

With “Beaverland: How One Weird Rodent Made America,” the writer Leila Philip adds to a genre of pro-beaver literature that turns out to be more populous than most of us may have known. She offers her own “canonical list” of appreciative books that includes “The American Beaver and His Works” (1868), by the anthropologist Lewis Henry Morgan, and “The Romance of the Beaver” (1914), by the naturalist A. Radclyffe Dugmore. A more recent example is the memorably titled “Once They Were Hats,” published in 2015 by the Canadian writer Frances Backhouse.

But it was the opening line of Dorothy Richards’s “Beaversprite” (1977) that truly drew Philip in. “I’m writing this with a 60-pound beaver on my lap,” Richards declared, going on to explain how she created a sanctuary near Little Falls, N.Y., not just around her property but inside her house, living with as many as 14 beavers at a time. The memoir includes a photograph of Richards having lunch with Eager, her favorite, with both of them seated at a cloth-covered table, china plates and all. The first time Richards brought a beaver into her house it dragged the rugs across the floor and pushed the chairs around, rearranging all the furniture in the room."

The creators of two new picture books succeed splendidly in this endeavor, shaping realistic narratives that take readers into migratory animals’ lives, where survival depends on highly developed senses, instincts and relationships.

Early in Candace Fleming’s POLAR BEAR (Neal Porter/Holiday House, 32 pp., $18.99, ages 4 to 8), we see the tip of the mother polar bear’s black nose poking out from the den near Canada’s Hudson Bay where she has given birth to two cubs and fasted for five months. As she exits the den, she sniffs the spring air for safety before inviting her cubs outside.

Following one family’s yearlong journey to find food and return home, “Polar Bear” is both a paean to a swiftly changing Arctic habitat and a deeply affecting story about fierce mother love. For a mother to nurse her cubs to a healthy weight, she has to trek with them to the sea ice, where she can gorge on seals, taking in the protein and nutrients she will pass to the cubs through her milk. (Polar bears can catch a whiff of seal more than 20 miles away.) Fleming expertly builds tension around whether the two cubs will survive this migration, season by season. She folds facts inside rhythmic descriptions, as in this encounter with wolves: “Hissing, she rises up to her full height — all seven feet of her./She is huge./Fierce./She growls./The wolves stop. Look. Lope away.” Alas, human-caused climate change has shrunk the bears’ habitat, posing a danger that Fleming explains succinctly and gently: “Too much ice is melting too soon./And too little ice means too little food.”

While Fleming’s narration is building suspense and wonder, the Caldecott medalist Eric Rohmann’s lush paintings move in for close-ups and stretch out to reveal the fantastic breadth of an icy landscape. In a double gatefold, Arctic blues and whites shimmer as the family completes a grueling swim to reach land; we see them both above and under the water. Afterward, blushes of golden midnight sun envelop them as the mother embraces her exhausted cubs atop an iceberg. Fleming and Rohmann’s respect and awe for these animals is palpable."

Twice in one week, I dreamed of doors: In one, I was crouched behind a door, hiding from an old high school classmate who was trying to enter, straining to peer down at me through a small glass window. Just a few nights later, I dreamed that I was inside a house with a glass door that I had locked to prevent a former boss from entering. Finding that she couldn’t get in, she turned away, hurt and confused. But suddenly the situation reversed itself. I was the one trying to get inside the house, and it was my boss — whom I could see through the same glass door — who was locking me out.

The dreams stayed with me, and I spent the next few days thinking about how I had changed since high school and that job many jobs ago; how, oblivious, we can shed relationships without really meaning to; and how it felt being behind those doors. Even as I write this, I see that the dreams were probably also about not wanting to be reminded of those previous versions of myself that I choose to believe I’ve convincingly sloughed off.

These weren’t revelations, yet I found my perception of myself and the world subtly altered. Having dreamed of someone, I might find myself more closely attuned to their behavior when I encounter them in real life. Recently I dreamed that my friend Molly was giving me feedback on an essay in a patch of grass in the neighborhood where I grew up; when I looked around, I realized all of the houses were mere facades supported by stilts. When I see her next, I’ll notice those qualities of hers that made my subconscious manifest her as a mentor and a confidante who reminds me of home and its complexities.

In dreams, even familiar worries I have interrogated to death take on an esoteric quality. Dread about a growing to-do list or upcoming deadline might manifest as a thick fog I’m perilously driving through, or a sandy beach full of crocodiles I must step around; anxiety about writing turns into a scene in which an editor and I determine a poem’s rhyme scheme. Recounting these visions doesn’t diminish my fears, or solve the problems that cause them. Nor do they give me a sense of control; that would be an illusion. But recording them does give me a new way to be alive to these feelings.

This sense of re-enchantment is the point of dream-journaling — not revelation but the invigorating habit of reflection. To that end, dreams are generous texts. Documenting lets you revisit them; revisiting them allows you to examine them anew. Whether my interpretations are “correct” hardly matters. Engaging with dreams puts me in touch with a self that is imaginative and expressive, able to transform mundanities into something glowing and mysterious. As stimulating as it can be to hunt for hidden meaning in my dreams, and even sometimes to feel that I’ve located it, the thrill lies in realizing that there are parts of myself that can still be uncovered. It feels to me like finding a new room in the apartment I’ve lived in for years. (More doors!)"

Though the new seasonal attraction in Hudson Yards takes the Spanish word for summer as its name, the plan is for it to be open well into November. (Climate change might blur the lines between seasons.) It’s operated by Rhubarb Hospitality Group, the English company that also runs Peak, the restaurant on the 101st floor at 30 Hudson Yards. This outdoor addition is in the public gardens, perfect for a close-up view of the Vessel and vistas across the Hudson at sunset, and seating on colorful serape-striped benches is tented to provide weatherproofing. An Airstream-style trailer serves as the bar. Casual Mexican fare — guacamole and chips, esquites, ceviche, Baja shrimp tacos and chicken al pastor tacos with pineapple mezcal salsa — dominates the menu. Pineapple carpaccio and churros are all you need for dessert. Margaritas come classic, spicy or frozen, and there are micheladas and palomas to drink along with beers and a brief assortment of European wines.

The latest: Israeli stocks and bonds fell after the attacks, and many businesses and schools in the country remain closed, while airlines have curtailed most flights to Tel Aviv. Israel’s central bank also said it will sell up to $30 billion worth of foreign reserves to shore up the shekel.

Qin Gang was abruptly removed as China’s foreign minister after disappearing from public view for 30 days. The move ended the career of a diplomat who had been one of President Xi Jinping’s most trusted rising stars.

Without government limits on pollution or subsidies, utilities are unlikely to go through the trouble.

But last year, that calculus began shifting. Under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, Congress increased existing tax credits that are now worth up to $85 for every ton of carbon dioxide that polluters capture and bury underground, up from a maximum of $50 previously.

That has led to growing interest. The owners of at least six coal plants and 14 large gas plants are conducting detailed engineering studies to gauge the economic feasibility of carbon capture and storage. Calpine Corporation, one of the country’s largest generators of electricity from natural gas, is exploring plans to install the technology at four large gas plants in Texas and California.

The federal tax credit on its own won’t be enough to cover the cost of capturing carbon from those gas plants, said Caleb Stephenson, Calpine’s executive vice president of commercial operations. The company is exploring other potential sources of financing so that it can bridge the gap and gain experience driving down costs for future carbon capture projects.

“We’re optimistic about this technology,” Mr. Stephenson said, adding that the electric grids of the future would need some electricity source that can run on demand at all hours to complement intermittent sources like wind and solar power. Carbon capture technology could allow gas-fired plants to provide that service without polluting."

World leaders are gathering in Indonesia for the G20 summit, which begins tomorrow.

But first, President Biden and Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, will meet face to face later today for the first time since Biden took office. (They have a long history: The two met as vice presidents. After a 2011 meeting, Biden said he found Xi potentially difficult to manage: “I think we’ve got our hands full with this guy,” he told advisers.)

The meeting will test whether the leaders can halt a downward spiral in relations.

Biden is in a strong position. In defiance of historical precedent, Democrats will maintain control of the U.S. Senate after winning seats in Nevada and Arizona. “I know I’m coming in stronger,” Biden said of the elections, “but I don’t need that.”

And Xi has signaled friendliness. He told the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations that he wanted to “find the right way to get along,” and a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said that “the U.S. and China should move toward each other, managing and controlling disagreements in a proper way and promoting mutually beneficial cooperation.”

By diversifying rapidly into alternate energy sources and bolstering efforts to conserve, he said, the Germans had staved off the danger of homes losing heat or electricity.

“I can say that our energy supply for this winter is secure,” Mr. Scholz said to a receptive audience at the annual gathering. “Thanks to well-filled storage facilities, thanks to improved energy efficiency, thanks to remarkable solidarity within Europe, and thanks to the readiness of our companies and of millions of citizens to save energy.”

In 2019, the museum turned down a $1.3 million donation from the Sackler family’s charitable arm. Members of the family owned Purdue Pharma, the company that made OxyContin, a drug that was blamed for a tide of deaths and addiction as part of the opioid crisis in the United States.

Ramos, the fund-raising expert, said the furor around the Sacklers had an immediate effect on philanthropy: Some donors feared they could one day be caught in a public backlash because of the source of their wealth, and museums had increased scrutiny of donations. But Cullinan said his museum’s decision to turn down the Sacklers offer turned out to have a positive impact: “People donated more than a £1 million on the back of that, because they admired the position taken,” he said. (He declined to name those donors.)

Although the National Portrait Gallery eventually raised enough for the renovation, it has struggled in other fund-raising drives. Over the past year, it tried to secure another £50 million to buy Joshua Reynolds’s “Portrait of Mai (Omai).” The work, painted around 1776, depicts a Polynesian man, wearing flowing white robes, who became a society figure during a visit to London. It is widely considered one of the most important portraits of a person of color in British art history.

Sarah Hilliam, the National Portrait Gallery’s director of development, recalled that she showed the painting to around 40 potential donors while the museum was trying to acquire it, and several told her it was “the worst time to be taking on an acquisition like this,” since the museum renovation was underway.

In the end, the museum reached an unusual deal with the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles to jointly buy the portrait. Hilliam said that under the terms of the agreement, “Portrait of Mai (Omai)” will spend three years in London before heading to Los Angeles for a similar period. The trans-Atlantic collaboration was “hopefully a good blueprint” for other museums struggling to buy masterpieces, Hilliam added."

The talks come just weeks before the United States is expected to run out of cash to pay its bills unless the nation’s borrowing cap is lifted. Like previous moments of brinkmanship, the discussions have echoes of 2011 and 2013, when congressional Republicans refused to raise the debt ceiling unless a Democratic president agreed to curb federal spending and reduce budget deficits. The same dynamic is at play now, but with a crucial difference: The parties share almost no common ground on tax and spending proposals that are meant to reduce the growth of the nation’s $31.4 trillion debt.

The meeting is not expected to produce anything close to final agreement on a fiscal plan that could include raising the debt limit. But even small points of consensus could be hard to come by.

Mr. Biden wants to expand federal spending and reduce future debt, largely by raising taxes on high earners and large companies. Republicans have passed a bill to cut federal discretionary spending — a category that includes national parks, education and more — and cancel tax breaks for certain low-emission energy sources that were part of Mr. Biden’s signature climate law.

Janet Yellen, as secretary of the Treasury, sells the bonds that cover federal budget deficits, so she has to keep in mind institutional investors’ distaste for policies that are perceived as “picking winners and losers.” She’s also an economist so she’s acutely aware of the gains of free trade, not just the drawbacks. Katherine Tai, the U.S. trade representative, tends to be more all-in on the worker-centric agenda. Gina Raimondo, as secretary of commerce, is responsible for several of the Biden administration’s biggest swings at industrial policy, so it’s little surprise that she’s on board. And so on.

I’ve assembled quotes from a variety of administration officials to give a sense of the diversity of thinking on worker-centric industrial policy. This is going to run long but you can skim. I’m giving the most space to Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, because his April 27 speech at the Brookings Institution was rightly seen as supplying intellectual scaffolding for Biden’s agenda.

Sullivan outlined what he called four “fundamental challenges” the United States faced when Biden entered office. First, the hollowing out of America’s industrial base, which he blamed on free-market ideology: “There was one assumption at the heart of all of this policy: that markets always allocate capital productively and efficiently — no matter what our competitors did, no matter how big our shared challenges grew and no matter how many guardrails we took down.” Second, he said, U.S. policymakers falsely assumed that “bringing countries into the rules-based order would incentivize them to adhere to its rules.” Third, climate change. Fourth, “the challenge of inequality and its damage to democracy.”

The Biden administration’s five solutions to the four problems:

An industrial strategy — “targeted public investments” into projects that the private sector doesn’t adequately support. This, he said, will “crowd in” private investment, not crowd it out.

What’s come to be known as friend-shoring: buying from friendly trading partners and making sure that they, too, are building production capacity and resilience.

A new approach to trade. Reducing tariffs, largely a success, is no longer the administration’s main focus, Sullivan said. Other priorities include “diversified and resilient supply chains,” clean energy, safe digital infrastructure, fighting corruption, preventing a race to the bottom in corporate tax rates, safeguarding labor and the environment and — of course — “creating good jobs along the way, family-supporting jobs.”

Mobilizing trillions of dollars of investment into developing countries.

“Protecting our foundational technologies with a small yard and high fence.” The small yard means protecting only technologies that are truly matters of national security. The high fence means protecting those few well.

Competition with China was the subtext of Sullivan’s remarks. He accused China of unfairly subsidizing industries, expanding its military ambitions and using lending to build influence in developing nations. But, he said, “we are not looking for confrontation or conflict” with China. He quoted Biden as saying that the two nations can and should cooperate on climate, macroeconomic stability, health security and food security. The stinger: He said “China has to be willing to play its part.”

Tai, the trade representative, echoed Sullivan in a speech at the National Press Club but hit China even harder. She said dependence on China for imports is a danger to national security and accused China of “economic coercion.” She said focusing solely on getting the cheapest products for American consumers is a mistake because “the consumer who enjoys the low prices of imported goods is also a worker who must withstand the downward pressures that come from competing with workers in other parts of the world toiling under exploitative conditions.”"

Thomas H. Lee, a pioneer in the trillion-dollar business of private equity, has died, his family confirmed yesterday. (The New York Post reports that he was found dead in his Manhattan office of what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.)

During his four-decade career in leveraged buyouts, Mr. Lee struck enormous takeovers, including some hugely profitable ones, and helped define the industry as a major force on Wall Street. Forbes recently estimated his net worth at about $2 billion.

Mr. Lee founded his buyout shop in 1974, drawing on an inheritance and a family loan, after working at L.F. Rothschild and First National Bank of Boston. What was then known as Thomas H. Lee Partners helped develop the traditional playbook for leveraged buyouts: borrowing huge sums of money to buy a company, then cutting costs and improving the bottom line before selling it again.

It was a model that was best exemplified by Mr. Lee’s signature deal, the 1992 takeover of Snapple. His firm bought the beverage maker for $135 million — with just $28 million coming from its own coffers — before selling it to Quaker Oats two years later for $1.7 billion."

The legion of creditors who lost billions in last month’s collapse of the crypto exchange FTX just got a tiny piece of good news: A number of parties that received payments and political contributions from the company; its jailed founder, Sam Bankman-Fried; and his associates have expressed a willingness to return the money, FTX said in a statement Monday night.

Politicians were among the biggest benefactors. Mr. Bankman-Fried; Ryan Salame, the former co-C.E.O. of FTX; and Nishad Singh, a former head of engineering at the company, have donated a total of $84.3 million to Democrats, Republicans and political action committees since 2019, according to data collected by OpenSecrets.org and shared with DealBook. Some politicians, including Hakeem Jeffries, the incoming Democratic leader in the House, and Representative-elect Aaron Bean, a Republican from Florida, have returned donations or given the money to charity since FTX fell into scandal.

Clawing back enough to make creditors whole will be difficult. FTX went bankrupt last month owing more than $3 billion to its top 50 creditors and having racked up losses that exceeded $8 billion.

Many commentators have pointed to the case of Bernie Madoff, the poster child for Ponzi schemers, as a model for how FTX’s new C.E.O., John Ray III, and a bankruptcy court might collect assets to repay depositors. In that case, judges ruled that a court-appointed trustee, Irving Picard, was allowed to claw back funds from anyone who pulled out more money than they put in."

The unassuming, 7,500-square-foot parcel of land, with its clean lines and quiet machinery, is an important component of New York’s transition to renewable energy: It is a battery energy storage system.

This three-megawatt system, made up of lithium-ion battery packs, can be used for backup power when there’s a peak demand for electricity, such as on hot summer days or during extreme weather any time of year, especially during hurricane season. (It can provide electricity for about 3,000 local homes for about four hours during a peak summer day.)

Batteries can provide power to the local grid when it’s needed. They are then recharged at night, when power usage is low. Currently, batteries can only generate a few hours of power per day, but scientists are working on developing long-term storage technology of 10 or more hours."

By the end of August, 11 named storms had formed. Only eight other hurricane seasons in more than 100 years of record-keeping have matched that pace, according to Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane expert at Colorado State University.

There’s growing recognition that gas stoves release hazardous chemicals into homes, contribute to global warming and produce emissions that may be linked to rates of childhood asthma.

Bans on gas appliances are unlikely to advance in Washington anytime soon because of fierce opposition from the gas industry and its political allies. But what about in California?

For the past few years, our state has been on the leading edge of gas-stove bans.

Republicans tend to be the loudest defenders of natural gas, but gas-powered stoves tend to be most common largely in Democratic-controlled states, my colleagues Elena Shao and Lisa Friedman report. In fact, the state with the highest percentage of households using natural gas for cooking (70 percent) is California, according to a 2020 analysis from the Energy Information Administration."

Then he extended an invitation to Anthony Albanese, the prime minister of Australia, for a state visit in Washington — a redo of sorts, when things would be calmer.

Then again, maybe there’s never really a good time.

This week, Mr. Biden is steering American involvement in two overseas wars and monitoring the continuing calamity of a speakerless House of Representatives, and there is another government shutdown crisis looming next month.

This state visit, which began on Tuesday evening and will feature a lavish dinner on Wednesday after a day of diplomacy, gives Mr. Biden an opportunity to nurture relations with an ally he sees as key to countering China, one of the president’s top priorities at a time of domestic and international tumult. John F. Kirby, a White House spokesman, played down the idea that global crises could distract Mr. Biden from his visitor, or perhaps even keep him waiting.

“Being president of the United States means balancing an awful lot of priorities and challenges, whether they’re domestic or foreign, and oftentimes the line between those blur pretty dang quickly,” Mr. Kirby told reporters on Tuesday.

The crush of news did prompt the White House to change its plans at the last minute for the entertainment portion of the visit. The B-52s, a Georgia-bred group most famous for their hits “Love Shack” and “Rock Lobster,” had been scheduled to perform, but Jill Biden, the first lady, said on Tuesday that the group would attend as guests. The U.S. Marine Band and the Army and Air Force Strolling Strings will provide instrumental music instead.

“We are now in a time when so many are facing sorrow and pain, so we made a few adjustments to the entertainment portion of the evening,” Dr. Biden said.

During Mr. Biden and Mr. Albanese’s time together, which includes a news conference scheduled for Wednesday afternoon, they are expected to emphasize their shared interests. The most crucial areas of cooperation are a joint contract with Britain to develop and deploy nuclear-powered attack submarines — which gives the United States a crucial technological edge against China — and expansion of a joint military presence in the Pacific islands, including Papua New Guinea.

The war between Israel and Hamas will also be on the agenda, Mr. Kirby said, including discussions of artificial intelligence, clean energy and fighting climate change. He said he expected several conversations about China, without offering specifics.

Bruce Jones, senior fellow at the Center for East Asia Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution, said in an interview that the United States-Australia relationship has been nurtured across presidential administrations. He added that Mr. Albanese’s visit was “cementing the notion that across administrations and across party politics, Australia is really emerging as central to America’s strategy for the Indo-Pacific region.”

In 2019, President Donald J. Trump hosted Mr. Albanese’s predecessor, Scott Morrison, for a rare state visit. Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Morrison were conservative leaders who rose to power on a wave of populism. Their agenda focused on intelligence sharing, joint military initiatives — including an American-led effort to protect ships from Iranian threats in the critical Strait of Hormuz — and cleaning ocean water.

Those elements of the relationship remain crucial regardless of the presidential administration, according to analysts. But the Biden administration’s emphasis on countering China — coupled with a rise in Chinese aggression and pressure tactics in the Indo-Pacific — has brought the United States into closer cooperation with Australia, even as Mr. Albanese plans to meet President Xi Jinping of China next month to discuss removing tariffs on Australian wine that China imposed during the pandemic.

“The shared sense of the objective of limiting and constraining Chinese naval and political ambitions in the region overrides the differences on trade relations,” Mr. Jones said.

Mr. Biden’s advisers say the administration is supportive of the meeting between Mr. Albanese and Mr. Xi.

Mr. Biden and Mr. Albanese are also likely to touch on the dysfunction in Congress. The Biden administration is relying on Congress to pass legislation that would allow for the shipment of nuclear-powered submarines to Australia, as part of an agreement called AUKUS among the United States, Britain and Australia.

U.S. officials said on Tuesday that Mr. Biden would tell the prime minister that the United States will fulfill that promise, but it is unclear how his administration’s legislative proposal would fare in a barely functional Congress.

As for the dinner, which is scheduled for Wednesday evening, the East Wing has arranged an outdoor affair under tents on the South Lawn."

At the summit, Biden plans to use the absences of Xi and Putin as an opportunity to present his case to the large group of important leaders that they should align with the U.S. on major issues including condemning Russia’s war in Ukraine and curbing China’s assertiveness.

There is little to no hope, however, that the G20 will as a group agree on issues such as aid to Ukraine or any sort of joint communiqué, which both China and Russia would have to sign off on.

Still, Biden will try to shore up his relationship with the summit’s host, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India. My colleague Katie Rogers, who is covering the summit, said Biden saw Modi as “politically stable.” But, she added, “it remains to be seen how much of a partner he could be in forcefully countering China’s rise.”"

Hope is slowly on the horizon.

The Birch Aquarium at Scripps Institution of Oceanography near San Diego successfully spawned three sunflower sea stars earlier this month, the latest success story in a sprawling collaborative effort among institutions to help sea stars reproduce and eventually reintroduce them to the wild.

One common theme came up in just about every conversation.

It was that every decision — big and small — is ultimately a trade-off: Sometimes it is a moral trade-off, sometimes it is an economic trade-off. Sometimes it is an economic trade-off versus a moral trade-off.

In every case a leader has to rationalize the trade-off. Sometimes that can win the leader popularity points and sometimes it is the opposite. And sometimes the decision itself proves in time to simply be wrong.

When times are less flush — like right about now — the trade-offs become harder and more complicated to make."

Last year, more than 8.2 million seats were allocated to the flight route between Melbourne and Sydney, placing it among the world’s most heavily trafficked. (Before Covid, it was even busier.) That might seem surprising, giving Australia’s comparatively small population. But the reason lies in the alternatives, or lack thereof.

Suppose you were traveling between Tokyo and Hiroshima, also a distance of about 840 kilometers, or roughly 520 miles. You could fly, if you wanted. But you’d probably choose to take the high-speed train, which takes less than four hours and avoids the fuss of checking in, elbowing your way through airport security and traveling to and from the airport.

Going between Melbourne and Sydney — or even Melbourne and Canberra — you simply don’t have that option. And while you could take a painfully slow overnight train or tackle a drive of a similar length, it’s understandable that most people simply book a seat on a 90-minute flight.

For almost 40 years, politicians have been talking about a rail alternative. Yet despite decades of proposals, working groups and budgets drawn and redrawn, the main way to get around Australia’s Eastern Seaboard is still on a plane."

As China’s harsh Covid rules extend deep into their third year, there are growing signs of discontent across the country. The defiance is a test of Xi Jinping’s leadership.

At the Foxconn iPhone factory in Zhengzhou, thousands of workers clashed with riot police. The workers were lashing out about a delay in the payment of bonuses as well as the company’s failure to properly isolate new workers from those who had tested positive. The new hires were recruited after thousands of workers fled the Foxconn plant last month because of a Covid outbreak.

Unrest is spreading elsewhere. In Guangzhou, migrant workers broke out of locked-down buildings to confront health workers and ransack food provisions. Online, many raged after a 4-month-old died. Her father said restrictions had delayed access to treatment.

Political fallout: Xi has used heavy censorship and severe punishment to silence critics, which makes the public airing of grievances particularly striking. Many Chinese have questioned the need for lockdowns at all. The unrest underscores the urgent question of how Xi can lead China out of the Covid era."

Tesla’s proprietary charging system, which it recently began calling the North American Charging Standard, is not a product of collaboration among numerous companies as is often the case with other technical standards.

On Tuesday, SAE International, an association of engineers that sets technical standards for aircraft and vehicles, said it had agreed with Tesla to establish a standard for the charging connector. The agreement will allow other automakers and charging companies to weigh in on the technology.

But oversight of other aspects of the system, like the software and charging equipment, was unclear and some competitors were skeptical of how much control Tesla would surrender.

The deal also comes with risks for Tesla. Exclusive access to the company’s charging stations, some of which already had long lines during busy travel times, has helped the company sell cars to customers who might chafe at having to wait behind Fords and Chevrolets.

Battles over technical standards are common with any new technology. The outcomes can be painful for companies or consumers who bet on the wrong horse. Just ask anyone who bought or invested in a video recorder, cellphone or digital music player that later became obsolete."

At least 74 people, including a dozen children, died yesterday in a fire in Johannesburg that tore through a building where squatters lived, city officials said. It was one of the deadliest residential fires in South Africa’s history.

My colleague Lynsey Chutel, who covers Johannesburg, arrived at the scene shortly after the fire broke out. “There was a real sense of chaos,” she said. “You could see people sitting on the sidewalk looking confused, looking helpless.”

A Johannesburg city councilman, who oversees public safety, said that when he arrived at the building, people were jumping out of windows to escape. (See why the apartment was a firetrap.)

Labour’s wins in two former Conservative strongholds — one of which the Tories had held since 1931 — came as Britain’s health care system suffers acute strain, the country faces persistent labor unrest and its economy stagnates amid high inflation.

The Ukrainian Army is moving cautiously into areas abandoned by Russian troops along a front line in the Kherson region of southern Ukraine, a day after Russia’s defense minister announced a retreat from the western bank of the Dnipro River. The move marked a significant setback for Russia’s military; in September it declared parts of the region Russian land.

Heavy fighting continues in some places, but the Ukrainian advance into Snihurivka, an important hub north of Kherson City that was abandoned overnight, indicates that the Russians are, indeed, retreating. Ukrainian officials had initially feared a ruse in the Russian announcement of a pullback, which followed days of enigmatic declarations from the occupying authorities.

Ukraine’s military yesterday said it had advanced into 100 square miles of land in the past 24 hours and had reclaimed 12 towns and villages. “The enemy is regrouping and taking measures to partially withdraw troops to the left bank of the Dnipro,” the military said in a statement, referring to the river’s eastern bank, where the Russian military has been building defenses.

The newly shrunken Twitter now faces numerous questions, including about its ability to maintain mission-critical systems, police content on its platform, remain in compliance with regulatory agreements and, frankly, stay afloat while laboring under a huge amount of debt.

Hundreds of employees have resigned, some even before Musk’s 5 p.m. Eastern pledge deadline took effect. The apparent feeling: better to take three months’ severance pay than to work under a leader who has demanded long hours and fired dozens of employees who had criticized him, some publicly.

She weathered a Republican primary challenge from the right in 2022 from a candidate endorsed by former President Donald J. Trump and learned the lesson that criticizing or opposing Mr. Trump in the G.O.P. would always be a trial.

But voters in her district believe the new map charted her course.

“Nancy has always been and will always be a maverick,” said Josh Whitley, a Berkeley County commissioner and a Mace ally. “But she has also always been very mindful of her constituents.”

The way South Carolina’s First Congressional District was redrawn by the Republican-led legislature touches on two consequential effects of gerrymandering at once: political dysfunction and polarization, and the potential for Black disenfranchisement. As Ms. Mace helps choose a new speaker in the Capitol on Wednesday, her district’s map was the subject of oral arguments before the Supreme Court where the conservative supermajority has recently shown sensitivity to the issue of racial gerrymandering.

Fresh off ruling that the Alabama Legislature had unlawfully diluted the strength of Black voters and ordering that congressional maps be redrawn — and rebuking G.O.P. legislators’ second attempt — the court will decide, most likely by January, whether South Carolina’s reworked First District constitutes an illegal racial gerrymander. The current House map moved 62 percent of the Black voters in Charleston County — 30,000 of them — to the Sixth District, a seat that Representative James Clyburn, a Black Democrat, has held for three decades, and moved inland white voters like Ms. Jurosko into the First District.

In 2020, she beat an incumbent Democrat, Joe Cunningham, by a single percentage point to win the seat. With the new map, Ms. Mace won re-election in 2022 by 14 points. (The justices on Wednesday appeared skeptical of a lower court’s ruling that the map was an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.)"

It’s kind of a shame that there is a pursuit on creating more and more and more without having the ones that are amazing still.”

How did the threesome end up as artistic directors of Ballet National de Marseille? While they were visiting Los Angeles, Dimitri Chamblas — the contemporary choreographer and dean of dance at California Institute of the Arts — asked them if they had seen the open call for the position. They had, but didn’t think much of it. Chamblas, who is also presenting a work as part of Dance Reflections, told them that they had to try. “He was like, ‘You’re young, you’re hot at the moment — if not now, when?’” the group said.

It made them think — not about the job, but about how applying for it could serve (La)Horde, in a deeper way. They decided that they would create a manifesto about what contemporary dance could be today.

“We were talking about the mutable forms that dance could take,” the group said. “We were also trying to get rid of this snobbism of, OK, there is this dance and then there is that dance — these scales of values that are completely terrible.”

To (La)Horde, dance is nonbinary: “There is so much segregation. Classical dance is something. Contemporary dance is something. Modern is something, and street dances and then TikTok dances. You have urban dance. What does it mean? We want to get rid of that idea of class.”

Obviously, (La)Horde got the job in Marseille, where they have built a company of dancers from 16 countries. Many groups espouse a commitment to diversity, but (La)Horde means it: Just as its members come from an array of cultures, they also have a range of bodies, ages and training. Along with skill and passion, they look for dancers with curiosity."

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., more than 50 years after his assassination, you might think that he gave exactly one speech — on Aug. 28, 1963, in Washington — and spoke exclusively about racial harmony and his oft-mentioned dream of integration.

But King, of course, is a more complicated figure than his sanctified image would suggest, and his body of work — his writings, speeches and interviews — is deeper and more wide-ranging than most Americans might appreciate. With our annual celebration of King’s life on the immediate horizon, I thought it would be worthwhile to look at one of his lesser-known, although by no means obscure, speeches, one in which he discusses the struggle for global peace.

King first delivered “A Christmas Sermon on Peace” on Christmas Eve, 1967, at Ebenezer Baptist Church, where he served as co-pastor. He begins with an observation and a prophetic warning:

This Christmas season finds us a rather bewildered human race. We have neither peace within nor peace without. Everywhere paralyzing fears harrow people by day and haunt them by night. Our world is sick with war; everywhere we see its ominous possibilities.

“If we don’t have good will toward men in this world,” he goes on to say, “we will destroy ourselves by misuse of our own instruments and our own power.”

King wants his congregants and listeners to experiment with nonviolence in arenas beyond the struggle for racial justice in the United States. But to do that, he says, one’s moral and ethical obligations must become ecumenical rather than sectional or parochial:

Our loyalties must transcend our race, our tribe, our class and our nation; and this means we must develop a world perspective. No individual can live alone; no nation can live alone, and as long as we try, the more we are going to have war in this world.

“We must either learn to live together as brothers,” he says, “or we are all going to perish together as fools.”"

Astonishing change is underway in Africa, where the population is projected to nearly double to 2.5 billion over the next quarter-century — an era that will not only transform many African countries, experts say, but also radically reshape their relationship with the rest of the world.

Birthrates are tumbling in richer nations, creating anxiety about how to care for, and pay for, their aging societies. But Africa’s baby boom continues apace, fueling the youngest, fastest growing population on earth.

In 1950, Africans made up 8 percent of the world’s people. A century later, they will account for one-quarter of humanity, and at least one-third of all young people aged 15 to 24, according to United Nations forecasts.

The median age on the African continent is 19. In India, the world’s most populous country, it is 28. In China and the United States, it is 38.

The implications of this “youthquake,” as some call it, are immense yet uncertain, and likely to vary greatly across Africa, a continent of myriad cultures and some 54 countries that covers an area larger than China, Europe, India and the United States combined. But its first signs are already here.

It reverberates in the bustle and thrum of the continent’s ballooning cities, their hectic streets jammed with new arrivals, that make Africa the most rapidly urbanizing continent on earth.

It pulses in the packed stadiums of London or New York, where African musicians are storming the world of pop, and in the heaving megachurches of West Africa, where the future of Christianity is being shaped.

And it shows in the glow of Africa’s 670 million cellphones, one for every second person on the continent — the dominant internet device used to move money, launch revolutions, stoke frustrations and feed dreams.

“It feels like the opportunities are unlimited for us right now,” said Jean-Patrick Niambé, a 24-year-old hip-hop artist from Ivory Coast who uses the stage name Dofy, as he rode in a taxi to a concert in the capital, Abidjan, this year.

Africa’s political reach is growing, too. Its leaders are courted at flashy summits by foreign powers that covet their huge reserves of the minerals needed to make electric cars and solar panels.

With a growing choice of eager allies, including Russia, China, the United States, Turkey and Gulf petrostates, African leaders are spurning the image of victim and demanding a bigger say. In September, the African Union joined the Group of 20, the premier forum for international economic cooperation, taking a seat at the same table as the European Union.

Businesses are chasing Africa’s tens of millions of new consumers emerging every year, representing untapped markets for cosmetics, organic foods, even champagne. Hilton plans to open 65 new hotels on the continent within five years. Its population of millionaires, the fastest growing on earth, is expected to double to 768,000 by 2027, the bank Credit Suisse estimates.

Dinner at Sushi Mitsuki, a new restaurant in a neighborhood with a rising skyline in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi, starts at $200 per person.

“Africa is entering a period of truly staggering change,” said Edward Paice, the director of the Africa Research Institute in London and the author of “Youthquake: Why African Demography Should Matter to the World.”

He added:

Nigeria Mozambique Kenya “The world is changing.” An expansive crowd of Muslims in holiday dress, standing shoulder to shoulder, their hands clasped and heads bowed in prayer. “And we need to start reimagining Africa’s place in it.” A woman lying under a blanket, nursing a baby wrapped in cloth. The energy in Africa contrasts with the rising uneasiness in Europe and Asia. Three young people doing a synchronized dance on a traffic island in a street.

In many countries, historically low birthrates are creating older, smaller populations. Caregivers in Italy, which is expected to have 12 percent fewer people by 2050, are experimenting with robots to look after the aged. The prime minister of Japan, where the median age is 48, warned in January that his society was “on the verge” of dysfunction.

Africa’s challenge is to manage unbridled growth. It has always been a young continent — only two decades ago the median age was 17 — but never on such a scale. Within the next decade, Africa will have the world’s largest work force, surpassing China and India. By the 2040s, it will account for two out of every five children born on the planet.

Experts say this approaching tide of humanity will push Africa to the fore of the most pressing concerns of our age, like climate change, the energy transition and migration.

But it has also exposed the continent’s gaping vulnerabilities.

Peril and Potential

Africa’s soaring population is partly a result of remarkable progress. Africans eat better and live longer than ever, on average. Infant mortality has been halved since 2000; calorie intake has soared.

But while a handful of African countries are poised to ride the demographic wave, others risk being swamped by it.

Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation, is already deeply stressed: Nearly two-thirds of its 213 million people live on less than $2 a day; extremist violence and banditry are rife; and life expectancy is just 53, nine years below the African average.

Yet Nigeria adds another five million people every year, and by 2050 is expected to overtake the United States as the world’s third most populous country.

Young Africans are better educated and more connected than ever: 44 percent graduated from high school in 2020, up from 27 percent in 2000, and about 570 million people use the internet. But finding a good job, or any job, is another matter.

Up to one million Africans enter the labor market every month, but fewer than one in four get a formal job, the World Bank says. Unemployment in South Africa, the continent’s most industrialized nation, runs at a crushing 35 percent.

Frustration feeds desperation.

In countries like Somalia, Mozambique and Mali, opportunity-starved youths pick up guns to fight for jihad, or for money. In Gabon and Niger, youngsters fed up with sham politics crowd streets and stadiums to yell slogans in favor of military coups.

On the high seas, smugglers’ boats make perilous journeys to Europe and the Middle East, carrying desperate young Africans and their dreams of a better future. At least 28,000 have died on the Mediterranean since 2014, the United Nations says.

The climate crisis is an especially urgent concern.

“Our generation takes things personally,” said Keziah Keya, a 21-year-old software engineer from Kenya.

Ms. Keya exemplifies the potential of that generation. Born into a poor family, she taught herself to code using the internet, and later represented Kenya at the International Math Olympiad in London. Last year, she was hired by a renewable energy company.

But she recently watched in dismay as a river near her home ran dry. Soon after, her grandmother’s crop of tomatoes withered. Starving cattle began to die. Three local herders took their own lives, she said.

“If we want to change things, we have to do it ourselves,” said Ms. Keya, who last month flew to Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania to study computer science, on a full scholarship. But she sees her future in Kenya. “We can’t afford to wait.”

Forecasting population trends is a fraught and contentious business, with a history of flawed predictions. In the 1970s, books like “The Population Bomb” by Paul R. Ehrlich popularized fears that an overcrowded planet would lead to mass starvation and societal collapse.

Africans are rightfully cautious of foreigners lecturing on the subject of family size. In the West, racists and right-wing nationalists stoke fears of African population growth to justify hatred, or even violence.

But experts say these demographic predictions are reliable, and that an epochal shift is underway. The forecasts for 2050 are sound because most of the women who will have children in the next few decades have already been born. Barring an unforeseeable upset, the momentum is unstoppable.

“It’s the mother of all megatrends,” said Carlos Lopes, an economist from Guinea-Bissau who formerly headed the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa.

Many others agree. The economic rise of China and India were the first great shocks of this century, they say. Africa’s youthful tide will most likely drive the next seismic shift.

Its first tremors are already being felt, and nowhere more than in global culture.

Cultural Powerhouse

When the Nigerian star Burna Boy stepped out before an adoring crowd at New York’s Citi Field this summer, he confirmed himself as pop royalty.

Weeks earlier, in London, he had filled an 80,000-capacity venue. In New York, he became the first African artist to sell out an American stadium.

He sang his new single, “Sittin’ on Top of the World.”

It was yet another milestone for Afrobeats, a West African musical genre that is becoming a global sensation. Afrobeats songs were streamed over 13 billion times on Spotify last year, up from eight billion in 2021; the genre’s biggest hit, Rema’s “Calm Down,” was a fan phenomenon at the soccer World Cup in Qatar. Countless TikTok dance challenges were born.

“It’s a great time to be alive,” said Laolu Senbanjo, a Nigerian artist living in Brooklyn. “Whether I’m in Target or an Uber, I hear the Afrobeats. It’s like a bridge. The world has come together.”

African artists seemed to be on red carpets everywhere this year — at the Grammy Awards, which added a new category for Best African Music; at the Met Gala, where the Nigerian singer Tems came fringed in ostrich feathers; and at the Cannes Film Festival, where a young French-Senegalese director, Ramata-Toulaye Sy, was a breakout star.

African fashion had its own shows in Paris and Milan. In Venice, Africa is the focus of this year’s Architectural Biennale. Last year, an architect from Burkina Faso won the prestigious Pritzker Prize. In 2021, Tanzania-born Abdulrazak Gurnah won the Nobel Prize in Literature.

“Africa’s not just one place,” he said in an interview. “It’s complicated and complex; differentiated, contrasted.”

Long viewed in the West as a niche interest — or worse, exotica — African culture has become the continent’s soft power, and, increasingly, a source of hard cash.

The world’s fastest growing music market is in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the main industry body. By 2030, Africa’s film and music industries could be worth $20 billion and create 20 million jobs, according to UNESCO estimates.

Young Africans are honing their talents, sensing an opening.

Nigeria Kenya Senegal In Lagos, young designers show their creations. Onlookers look up and some cheer a model striding on a runway in a cropped t-shirt, embroidered wide-legged jeans and stiletto heels. In Nairobi, hundreds in a poor neighborhood are learning to play classical music. Three young Kenyans in the foreground of a classroom concentrating as they play violins. In Dakar, a break-dancing team prepares to perform in the youth Olympics. A group of young adults sharing a laugh, including a woman sitting on the floor in front of a bowl of dates next to two smiling men holding cellphones.

Scriptwriters and animators are shaking off the clichéd image of a continent defined by famine and conflict to tell new stories — frothy reality shows, gritty gangster tales and even children’s cartoons, made in Africa by Africans, that have aired on streaming services like Disney+ and Amazon Prime.

This summer, “Supa Team Four,” a cartoon series about teenage superheroes from Zambia who save the world, aired on Netflix. The theme is power — girl power, teen power but also plain electricity: The chief villain tries to knock out the city power grid.

Malenga Mulendema, the show’s creator, worked with a team across six African countries, and said that the movie “Black Panther,” when it came out in 2018, “paved the way” for new depictions of Africa. “People want to box us in,” she said. “But when you have multiple shows like this you can’t box in, anymore, what it means to tell an African story.”

The commercial potential of Africa’s cultural might is only starting to be realized. Netflix has spent $175 million in Africa since 2016, but has plans to invest $2.5 billion in South Korea. It was not until 2004 that a work by an African artist sold for over $1 million at auction, according to Hannah O’Leary, the head of modern and contemporary African art at Sotheby’s. Since then, another 11 have passed that bar‌. “But the market is still hugely under-realized,” she said.

Foreign companies are looking to cash in. This year gamma, a music company owned in part by Apple, set up an office in Lagos, hoping to discover the next Burna Boy, or even a host of smaller stars. “We’re going straight to the source,” said Sipho Dlamini, a gamma executive.

Born in Zimbabwe but raised in Watford, outside London, in the 1980s, Mr. Dlamini remembers being bullied because of his background. “We were called names,” he said. “All kinds of names.”

Now, “African” is a badge of pride. “Historically, the image was what people saw on TV: kids starving, kwashiorkor and flies,” he said, referring to a severe form of malnutrition marked by a swollen belly. “Now they will tell you they are dying to come to Cape Town, to Mombasa, to Zanzibar. It’s cool to be African.”

Jobs Crisis

Zeinab Moawad wondered if she was wasting her time.

The 18-year-old stood outside the tutoring center in Cairo where she had spent a year cramming for college entrance exams. But even if she was granted a place in Egypt’s best engineering or medical schools, she doubted that it would lead to a good job.

“We’re on our own,” she said.

Not long ago, technology was the big idea for enabling Africa to leapfrog its way out of poverty.

Start-ups sprouted in countries like Nigeria, South Africa and Morocco. Innovative technologies, like M-Pesa, brought mobile banking to tens of millions of people. Women-only coding schools emerged. Microsoft and Google established major centers in Kenya, the self-styled “Silicon Savannah” of East Africa. Optimists spoke of an “Africa rising.”

But while technology brought billions in investment, it failed dismally on one crucial front: creating jobs.

Nigeria Mozambique Morocco Chronic unemployment, an old problem, is now a major crisis. A young boy, covered in white dust, holding a bucket and walking by sacks of grain in a market. The continent’s working-age population — people aged 15 to 65 — will hit one billion in the next decade. Five fishermen working in a wooden boat on a gray sea under gray skies. What will these one billion workers do? A man in a white t-shirt and shorts leaning against the open doorway of a cinderblock house.

“That’s a problem,” said Mo Ibrahim, a Sudanese-born telecommunications tycoon and philanthropist.

It is also a problem for the world, said Aubrey Hruby, an investor in Africa and an author of “The Next Africa.” She said, “After climate change, Africa’s jobs crisis will be a defining challenge of our era.”

Elsewhere, the answer was industrialization. In the 1970s and 1980s, when China, South Korea and Japan were the engines of population growth, their factories were filled with young people producing clothes, cars and TVs. It made them rich and lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty.

Africa is poorly positioned to repeat that feat. Other than South Africa and a handful of countries in North Africa, most of the continent has failed to industrialize. In fact, it is losing ground: Africa’s share of global manufacturing is smaller today than it was in 1980.

Infrastructure is an obstacle. Six hundred million Africans, or four in 10, lack electricity. An average American refrigerator consumes more power in a year than a typical person in Africa. Major roads and railways often lead to the coasts, a legacy of extractive colonialism, which inhibits trade between countries.

And the baby boom endures, smothering economic growth.

Other regions, like East Asia, prospered only after their birthrates had fallen substantially and a majority of their people had joined the work force — a phenomenon known as the “demographic transition” that has long driven global growth. Britain’s transition took two centuries, from the 1740s to the 1940s. Thailand did it in about 40 years.

But in Africa, where birthrates remain stubbornly high — nearly twice the global average — that transition has proved elusive.

The picture changes greatly from one country to another. In South Africa, women have two children on average, while in Niger they have seven. Some smaller economies, like those of Rwanda and Ivory Coast, are among the world’s fastest growing. But on the whole, the continent cannot keep pace with its swelling population.

Adjusted for population size, Africa’s economy has grown by 1 percent annually since 1990, according to the global consulting firm McKinsey & Company. Over the same period, India’s grew 5 percent per year and China’s grew 9 percent.

Despite making up 18 percent of the global population, Africa accounts for just 3 percent of all trade.

For legions of jobless and frustrated young Africans, that leaves only one good option: Get out. Every year, tens of thousands of doctors, nurses, academics and other skilled migrants flee the continent. (At least one million Africans from south of the Sahara have moved to Europe since 2010, according to the Pew Research Center.) Migration is such a feature of life in Nigeria that young people have a name for it — “japa,” Yoruba slang that means “to run away.”

And the countries they leave behind depend on them to survive. In 2021, African migrants sent home $96 billion in remittances, three times more than the sum of all foreign aid, according to the African Development Bank.

“The African diaspora has become the largest financier of Africa,” said Akinwumi Adesina, the bank’s head.

In fact, the majority of young migrants do not even leave the continent, moving instead to other countries in Africa. But the plight of those who gamble their lives to travel further — left to die in sinking boats by the Greek Coast Guard, gunned down by Saudi border police or even stumbling through Central American jungle to reach the United States — has become a potent emblem of generational desperation.

The new big idea to invigorate African economies is the transition to green energy. African governments and investors are angling for a piece of the global effort, sure to involve trillions of dollars in the coming decades, which they hope can deliver Africa’s much-sought-after industrial revolution.

Africa has 60 percent of the world’s solar energy potential and 70 percent of its cobalt, a key mineral for making electric vehicles. Its tropical rainforests pull more carbon from the atmosphere than the Amazon. Ambitious ventures are taking shape in numerous countries: a dazzling solar tower in Morocco; a $10 billion green hydrogen plant in Namibia; a Kenyan-made machine that extracts carbon from the air.

The Africa Climate Summit, which took place in Nairobi in September, not only galvanized those seeking to profit from the climate transition, it also produced a bullish new narrative.

“Africa is neither poor nor desperate,” President William Ruto of Kenya said.

Whether young Africans can truly tap the potential of the coming energy revolution depends on other factors, too, not least the capacities of their entrenched and aging leaders.

Young Voters, Old Leaders

A youthful continent is run by old men. The average African leader is 63 years old; the oldest, President Paul Biya of Cameroon, is 90, a full 72 years older than the average Cameroonian. Under their grip, democracy has fallen to its lowest point in decades: Half of all Africans live in countries considered “not free” by Freedom House.

Five African heads of state, including Mr. Biya, have held power for more than three decades; nearly all are grooming their sons as successors. “Sick old men,” said the Nigerian writer and Nobel laureate, Wole Soyinka, in an interview.

Even so, foreign powers are scrambling to back them.

President Paul Kagame of Rwanda, in power since 1994, receives over $1 billion in Western aid annually, and has established his tiny country as a hub for sports and international conferences — even as he is accused of killing or kidnapping his critics, or purports to win elections by a margin of 99 percent.

As the United States, China and Russia vie for position, an array of middle powers is crowding in too. About 400 new embassies have opened in African countries since 2012, according to the Diplometrics Program at the University of Denver; Turkey, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and India top the list.

Yet there is one key group that Africa’s gerontocrats have disastrously failed to win over: the alienated youth of their own nations.

“Our elites treat us like idiots,” Nourdine Aouadé, a lawyer and young political leader, said at his office in Niger’s capital, Niamey, after a military takeover in August. Like many young Nigeriens, Mr. Awade, 32, supported the action.

“Coups are just the consequence of social injustice,” he said.

Senegal Kenya Kenya Most young Africans admire and desire democracy, numerous polls have found. Male students in a university dorm room, sitting on wooden bunk beds and looking at laptops together. But disillusionment with politicians’ empty promises is giving rise to a new age of protest Young men throwing rocks, next to an overturned car in an urban shantytown. and to political activism, like these performance artists focused on climate change. Three people standing upright in rubble next to a patched corrugated iron building. They are wearing uniforms with straps crossing in X’s over their chests and small potted trees balanced on their heads.

Youthful uprisings first flared in 2011, during the Arab Spring, when an uprising in Tunisia inspired others in Egypt and Libya. Later, powerful demonstrations erupted in Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Senegal and even Eswatini, a tiny kingdom of 1.2 million people in southern Africa.

This year, young people have channeled their anger into pro-military populism — cheering the new junta in Niger or, weeks later, Gabon, where they posted TikTok videos mocking their newly ousted president, Ali Bongo Ondimba. Other leaders, watching nervously, worry that they could be next.

The age gap between geriatric leaders and restless youth is “a major source of tension” in many African countries, said Simon Mulongo, a former African Union diplomat from Uganda. “It’s a powder keg, and it can explode anytime.”

One day last spring, Nuha Abdelgadir was hunched over her phone at a cafe in Sudan’s capital, Khartoum. Her thumb flicked restlessly through a gallery of smiling faces — friends who had been killed by Sudan’s security forces in pro-democracy demonstrations. Ms. Abdelgadir, 18, had come to take their place.

“We’re equal with the boys,” she said, gesturing to another young woman. “We’ve got shields, we throw stones, we clash.”

Her group, “Anger Without Limits,” was at the fore of the street clashes that had occurred every week since Sudan’s military had seized power in a coup 18 months earlier. Ms. Abdelgadir’s job was to pluck streaming tear-gas canisters from the ground and fling them back at the police. It was risky work, she admitted; over 100 protesters had been killed. But, she said, “I don’t care.”

Weeks later, Sudan tumbled into war. Fighting between rival military factions in mid-April rippled across Khartoum, then the country. On the third day of fighting, a stray shell punched through Ms. Abdelgadir’s home, sending it up in flames. She fled with her family to the countryside. By September, she was planning to leave Sudan, and even the continent.

Even then, she insisted she would be back to finish what she had started. “We will take to the streets again,” she texted, the night before boarding a bus taking her over Sudan’s border into Ethiopia. “The democracy we dream of will come.”

Militants Spreading

While some take flight, others pick up a gun.

In the Sahel, the semiarid region bordering the Sahara that runs across the African continent, tens of thousands of teenagers have joined militant groups linked to Al Qaeda and Islamic State. They bring havoc in their wake — thousands of civilians killed, five million forced from their homes and political destabilization that has led to a string of military coups.

But the main driver of this powerful insurgency is not an extremist ideology or religious belief, according to a U.N. study of 1,000 former fighters from eight countries. Instead, researchers found, the single biggest reason for joining a militant group was the simple desire to have a job.

Modu Ali, from a poor family with 10 children in northern Nigeria, had barely finished primary school when he joined the extremist group Boko Haram, over a decade ago. His goal was to “fight for the rights of the deprived,” he said. “Instead it ruined my life.” He surrendered and joined a rehabilitation program for former fighters.

The Sahel leads the world in two ways. It is the global center of extremist violence, accounting for 43 percent of all such deaths in 2022, according to the Global Terrorism Index. And it has the highest birthrates — on average seven children per woman in Niger and northern Nigeria, six in Mali and Chad, and five in Sudan and Burkina Faso.

Nigeria Nigeria Morocco High birthrates alone do not cause insurgencies. Women in hijabs and flowing dresses, many holding babies and children, waiting at a maternity clinic. But they are a major accelerant when combined with weak states and deep poverty. A boy holding an axe over his head, chopping wood in a pen holding longhorn cattle. A warming planet is also a major factor, erasing livelihoods and driving people to desperation. Young boys sitting on a small wooden boat that is stranded on a cracked, dry riverbed.

These factors are why many view the Sahel as the most worrisome manifestation of Africa’s “youthquake.”

One key to tackling that problem lies with teenage girls like Asiya Saidu.

Like many in Zaria, a Muslim-majority city in northern Nigeria, Ms. Saidu expected to be married by 14 and to have her first child soon after. “My uncle was hellbent on finding me a husband,” she recalled.

Instead, she enrolled at the Center for Girls Education, an American-funded program that has helped as many as 70,000 girls to stay in school, and ultimately to have smaller families.

Educating girls has an unusually large effect on family size in Africa because it delays the age of marriage and helps young women to space out their children, researchers have found. “It’s a natural kind of birth control,” said Habiba Mohammed, the program’s director.

Ms. Saidu, now 17, recently applied for nursing school.

“I do want to get married,” she said. But first, she said, “I want to be independent and learn to support myself.”

The Future Is Already Here

It could be that Africa will undergo transformations that are hard to see now.

When the economist Ha-Joon Chang was growing up in South Korea in the 1960s, his country was subjected to the same condescension and racism leveled at many African nations today, he said. It was poor, had just emerged from war, and was seen by American officials as a basket case.

“Nobody took us seriously,” said Mr. Chang, now a professor of economics at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London.

That South Korea has become one of the world’s largest economies shows how success can strike in the most unlikely places, Mr. Chang added: “With time and effort, remarkable transformations are possible.”

A young population was a big part of South Korea’s success, Mr. Chang said. But it took other ingredients, too: visionary leaders, wise policies and education, as well as intangibles like drive, innovation and sheer good fortune, he said. “A lot of things have to work together.”

Could Africa’s youth boom portend a similar miracle?

This year’s surging turmoil — new crises, new wars and new economic slumps — would give pause to the greatest of optimists. Yet there are also reasons to hope.

“I tell my friends in England that the time will come when they will put out a red carpet for those guys now coming in boats,” said Mr. Ibrahim, the philanthropist.

Some, like Nedye Astou Touré, are already reaching for the stars.

Ms. Touré, a 23-year-old student, stood over a pile of old aircraft parts at a university lab in Dakar, the capital of Senegal. Her eyes gleamed with anticipation. “It’s for a rocket,” she said of the pile.

She and another senior at the university hope to launch their projectile 100 meters into the air, a first step toward building a low-orbit satellite.

It might take a while, Ms. Touré admitted. But while others with such grand dreams have typically left Africa behind, she wanted to show it can be done at home.

“Just wait,” she said. “Three years from now you might be hearing about us.”"

Was the storm system unusual from a weather perspective?

It is not uncommon to see powerful storms make their way across the middle of the country in the spring, according to Colby Pope, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Little Rock, Ark. But the number of tornadoes that this storm produced was unusual, he said.

Trained spotters reported nearly 100 locations where tornadoes were spotted or had caused damage Friday and Saturday, according to the Weather Service. The exact number of individual tornadoes might not be known for days. A storm system producing “20 to 30 tornadoes is pretty common,” Mr. Pope said. But the total for this storm, spread across multiple states, was “a cut above” what meteorologists considered a normal outbreak, he added."

The markets were in free fall after the disastrous 49-day tenure of his predecessor, Liz Truss, and the government was in disarray. Mr. Sunak, who had been rejected by Conservative Party members earlier in the year, was inserted by lawmakers in the desperate hope he could calm the crisis. Given that the party had just ousted two leaders in quick succession, it was unclear how long he would even stay in the post.

One year later, he can take comfort that Britain is in a different place. It’s now possible, for a start, to have a conversation with visitors without being asked what on earth is going on. Projecting decency and stability, Mr. Sunak has calmed the markets, helped to repair relations with the European Union and sated his party’s appetite for regicide. The next election, due by January 2025, is on the horizon. Even party critics concede that Mr. Sunak will lead the Conservatives into it.

But that’s where the good news stops for the prime minister. While Mr. Sunak has moved his party out of crisis mode, he has yet to win over voters. Against hopes that a new leader would raise the party’s fortunes, Mr. Sunak’s approval ratings have sunk along with esteem for the Conservatives. The polls repeatedly suggest a 20-point lead for the opposition Labour Party, whose leader, Keir Starmer, businesses and the media view as the prime minister in waiting.

Adding to a sense of fatalism, a steady drip feed of local elections — often set off by the bad behavior of Tory lawmakers — has cost the Conservatives once-safe seats. Two more, including one in Conservative hands since 1931, went over to the opposition last week. Mr. Sunak may be doing his best, in trying circumstances. But at the moment, it’s nowhere near enough."

Astonishing change is underway in Africa, where the population is projected to nearly double to 2.5 billion over the next quarter-century — an era that will not only transform many African countries, experts say, but also radically reshape their relationship with the rest of the world.

Birthrates are tumbling in richer nations, creating anxiety about how to care for, and pay for, their aging societies. But Africa’s baby boom continues apace, fueling the youngest, fastest growing population on earth.

In 1950, Africans made up 8 percent of the world’s people. A century later, they will account for one-quarter of humanity, and at least one-third of all young people aged 15 to 24, according to United Nations forecasts.

The median age on the African continent is 19. In India, the world’s most populous country, it is 28. In China and the United States, it is 38.

The implications of this “youthquake,” as some call it, are immense yet uncertain, and likely to vary greatly across Africa, a continent of myriad cultures and some 54 countries that covers an area larger than China, Europe, India and the United States combined. But its first signs are already here.

It reverberates in the bustle and thrum of the continent’s ballooning cities, their hectic streets jammed with new arrivals, that make Africa the most rapidly urbanizing continent on earth.

It pulses in the packed stadiums of London or New York, where African musicians are storming the world of pop, and in the heaving megachurches of West Africa, where the future of Christianity is being shaped.

And it shows in the glow of Africa’s 670 million cellphones, one for every second person on the continent — the dominant internet device used to move money, launch revolutions, stoke frustrations and feed dreams.

“It feels like the opportunities are unlimited for us right now,” said Jean-Patrick Niambé, a 24-year-old hip-hop artist from Ivory Coast who uses the stage name Dofy, as he rode in a taxi to a concert in the capital, Abidjan, this year.

Africa’s political reach is growing, too. Its leaders are courted at flashy summits by foreign powers that covet their huge reserves of the minerals needed to make electric cars and solar panels.

With a growing choice of eager allies, including Russia, China, the United States, Turkey and Gulf petrostates, African leaders are spurning the image of victim and demanding a bigger say. In September, the African Union joined the Group of 20, the premier forum for international economic cooperation, taking a seat at the same table as the European Union.

Businesses are chasing Africa’s tens of millions of new consumers emerging every year, representing untapped markets for cosmetics, organic foods, even champagne. Hilton plans to open 65 new hotels on the continent within five years. Its population of millionaires, the fastest growing on earth, is expected to double to 768,000 by 2027, the bank Credit Suisse estimates.

Dinner at Sushi Mitsuki, a new restaurant in a neighborhood with a rising skyline in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi, starts at $200 per person.

“Africa is entering a period of truly staggering change,” said Edward Paice, the director of the Africa Research Institute in London and the author of “Youthquake: Why African Demography Should Matter to the World.”

He added:

Nigeria Mozambique Kenya “The world is changing.” An expansive crowd of Muslims in holiday dress, standing shoulder to shoulder, their hands clasped and heads bowed in prayer. “And we need to start reimagining Africa’s place in it.” A woman lying under a blanket, nursing a baby wrapped in cloth. The energy in Africa contrasts with the rising uneasiness in Europe and Asia. Three young people doing a synchronized dance on a traffic island in a street.

In many countries, historically low birthrates are creating older, smaller populations. Caregivers in Italy, which is expected to have 12 percent fewer people by 2050, are experimenting with robots to look after the aged. The prime minister of Japan, where the median age is 48, warned in January that his society was “on the verge” of dysfunction.

Africa’s challenge is to manage unbridled growth. It has always been a young continent — only two decades ago the median age was 17 — but never on such a scale. Within the next decade, Africa will have the world’s largest work force, surpassing China and India. By the 2040s, it will account for two out of every five children born on the planet.

Experts say this approaching tide of humanity will push Africa to the fore of the most pressing concerns of our age, like climate change, the energy transition and migration.

But it has also exposed the continent’s gaping vulnerabilities.

Peril and Potential

Africa’s soaring population is partly a result of remarkable progress. Africans eat better and live longer than ever, on average. Infant mortality has been halved since 2000; calorie intake has soared.

But while a handful of African countries are poised to ride the demographic wave, others risk being swamped by it.

Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation, is already deeply stressed: Nearly two-thirds of its 213 million people live on less than $2 a day; extremist violence and banditry are rife; and life expectancy is just 53, nine years below the African average.

Yet Nigeria adds another five million people every year, and by 2050 is expected to overtake the United States as the world’s third most populous country.

Young Africans are better educated and more connected than ever: 44 percent graduated from high school in 2020, up from 27 percent in 2000, and about 570 million people use the internet. But finding a good job, or any job, is another matter.

Up to one million Africans enter the labor market every month, but fewer than one in four get a formal job, the World Bank says. Unemployment in South Africa, the continent’s most industrialized nation, runs at a crushing 35 percent.

Frustration feeds desperation.

In countries like Somalia, Mozambique and Mali, opportunity-starved youths pick up guns to fight for jihad, or for money. In Gabon and Niger, youngsters fed up with sham politics crowd streets and stadiums to yell slogans in favor of military coups.

On the high seas, smugglers’ boats make perilous journeys to Europe and the Middle East, carrying desperate young Africans and their dreams of a better future. At least 28,000 have died on the Mediterranean since 2014, the United Nations says.

The climate crisis is an especially urgent concern.

“Our generation takes things personally,” said Keziah Keya, a 21-year-old software engineer from Kenya.

Ms. Keya exemplifies the potential of that generation. Born into a poor family, she taught herself to code using the internet, and later represented Kenya at the International Math Olympiad in London. Last year, she was hired by a renewable energy company.

But she recently watched in dismay as a river near her home ran dry. Soon after, her grandmother’s crop of tomatoes withered. Starving cattle began to die. Three local herders took their own lives, she said.

“If we want to change things, we have to do it ourselves,” said Ms. Keya, who last month flew to Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania to study computer science, on a full scholarship. But she sees her future in Kenya. “We can’t afford to wait.”

Forecasting population trends is a fraught and contentious business, with a history of flawed predictions. In the 1970s, books like “The Population Bomb” by Paul R. Ehrlich popularized fears that an overcrowded planet would lead to mass starvation and societal collapse.

Africans are rightfully cautious of foreigners lecturing on the subject of family size. In the West, racists and right-wing nationalists stoke fears of African population growth to justify hatred, or even violence.

But experts say these demographic predictions are reliable, and that an epochal shift is underway. The forecasts for 2050 are sound because most of the women who will have children in the next few decades have already been born. Barring an unforeseeable upset, the momentum is unstoppable.

“It’s the mother of all megatrends,” said Carlos Lopes, an economist from Guinea-Bissau who formerly headed the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa.

Many others agree. The economic rise of China and India were the first great shocks of this century, they say. Africa’s youthful tide will most likely drive the next seismic shift.

Its first tremors are already being felt, and nowhere more than in global culture.

Cultural Powerhouse

When the Nigerian star Burna Boy stepped out before an adoring crowd at New York’s Citi Field this summer, he confirmed himself as pop royalty.

Weeks earlier, in London, he had filled an 80,000-capacity venue. In New York, he became the first African artist to sell out an American stadium.

He sang his new single, “Sittin’ on Top of the World.”

It was yet another milestone for Afrobeats, a West African musical genre that is becoming a global sensation. Afrobeats songs were streamed over 13 billion times on Spotify last year, up from eight billion in 2021; the genre’s biggest hit, Rema’s “Calm Down,” was a fan phenomenon at the soccer World Cup in Qatar. Countless TikTok dance challenges were born.

“It’s a great time to be alive,” said Laolu Senbanjo, a Nigerian artist living in Brooklyn. “Whether I’m in Target or an Uber, I hear the Afrobeats. It’s like a bridge. The world has come together.”

African artists seemed to be on red carpets everywhere this year — at the Grammy Awards, which added a new category for Best African Music; at the Met Gala, where the Nigerian singer Tems came fringed in ostrich feathers; and at the Cannes Film Festival, where a young French-Senegalese director, Ramata-Toulaye Sy, was a breakout star.

African fashion had its own shows in Paris and Milan. In Venice, Africa is the focus of this year’s Architectural Biennale. Last year, an architect from Burkina Faso won the prestigious Pritzker Prize. In 2021, Tanzania-born Abdulrazak Gurnah won the Nobel Prize in Literature.

“Africa’s not just one place,” he said in an interview. “It’s complicated and complex; differentiated, contrasted.”

Long viewed in the West as a niche interest — or worse, exotica — African culture has become the continent’s soft power, and, increasingly, a source of hard cash.

The world’s fastest growing music market is in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the main industry body. By 2030, Africa’s film and music industries could be worth $20 billion and create 20 million jobs, according to UNESCO estimates.

Young Africans are honing their talents, sensing an opening.

Nigeria Kenya Senegal In Lagos, young designers show their creations. Onlookers look up and some cheer a model striding on a runway in a cropped t-shirt, embroidered wide-legged jeans and stiletto heels. In Nairobi, hundreds in a poor neighborhood are learning to play classical music. Three young Kenyans in the foreground of a classroom concentrating as they play violins. In Dakar, a break-dancing team prepares to perform in the youth Olympics. A group of young adults sharing a laugh, including a woman sitting on the floor in front of a bowl of dates next to two smiling men holding cellphones.

Scriptwriters and animators are shaking off the clichéd image of a continent defined by famine and conflict to tell new stories — frothy reality shows, gritty gangster tales and even children’s cartoons, made in Africa by Africans, that have aired on streaming services like Disney+ and Amazon Prime.

This summer, “Supa Team Four,” a cartoon series about teenage superheroes from Zambia who save the world, aired on Netflix. The theme is power — girl power, teen power but also plain electricity: The chief villain tries to knock out the city power grid.

Malenga Mulendema, the show’s creator, worked with a team across six African countries, and said that the movie “Black Panther,” when it came out in 2018, “paved the way” for new depictions of Africa. “People want to box us in,” she said. “But when you have multiple shows like this you can’t box in, anymore, what it means to tell an African story.”

The commercial potential of Africa’s cultural might is only starting to be realized. Netflix has spent $175 million in Africa since 2016, but has plans to invest $2.5 billion in South Korea. It was not until 2004 that a work by an African artist sold for over $1 million at auction, according to Hannah O’Leary, the head of modern and contemporary African art at Sotheby’s. Since then, another 11 have passed that bar‌. “But the market is still hugely under-realized,” she said.

Foreign companies are looking to cash in. This year gamma, a music company owned in part by Apple, set up an office in Lagos, hoping to discover the next Burna Boy, or even a host of smaller stars. “We’re going straight to the source,” said Sipho Dlamini, a gamma executive.

Born in Zimbabwe but raised in Watford, outside London, in the 1980s, Mr. Dlamini remembers being bullied because of his background. “We were called names,” he said. “All kinds of names.”

Now, “African” is a badge of pride. “Historically, the image was what people saw on TV: kids starving, kwashiorkor and flies,” he said, referring to a severe form of malnutrition marked by a swollen belly. “Now they will tell you they are dying to come to Cape Town, to Mombasa, to Zanzibar. It’s cool to be African.”

Jobs Crisis

Zeinab Moawad wondered if she was wasting her time.

The 18-year-old stood outside the tutoring center in Cairo where she had spent a year cramming for college entrance exams. But even if she was granted a place in Egypt’s best engineering or medical schools, she doubted that it would lead to a good job.

“We’re on our own,” she said.

Not long ago, technology was the big idea for enabling Africa to leapfrog its way out of poverty.

Start-ups sprouted in countries like Nigeria, South Africa and Morocco. Innovative technologies, like M-Pesa, brought mobile banking to tens of millions of people. Women-only coding schools emerged. Microsoft and Google established major centers in Kenya, the self-styled “Silicon Savannah” of East Africa. Optimists spoke of an “Africa rising.”

But while technology brought billions in investment, it failed dismally on one crucial front: creating jobs.

Nigeria Mozambique Morocco Chronic unemployment, an old problem, is now a major crisis. A young boy, covered in white dust, holding a bucket and walking by sacks of grain in a market. The continent’s working-age population — people aged 15 to 65 — will hit one billion in the next decade. Five fishermen working in a wooden boat on a gray sea under gray skies. What will these one billion workers do? A man in a white t-shirt and shorts leaning against the open doorway of a cinderblock house.

“That’s a problem,” said Mo Ibrahim, a Sudanese-born telecommunications tycoon and philanthropist.

It is also a problem for the world, said Aubrey Hruby, an investor in Africa and an author of “The Next Africa.” She said, “After climate change, Africa’s jobs crisis will be a defining challenge of our era.”

Elsewhere, the answer was industrialization. In the 1970s and 1980s, when China, South Korea and Japan were the engines of population growth, their factories were filled with young people producing clothes, cars and TVs. It made them rich and lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty.

Africa is poorly positioned to repeat that feat. Other than South Africa and a handful of countries in North Africa, most of the continent has failed to industrialize. In fact, it is losing ground: Africa’s share of global manufacturing is smaller today than it was in 1980.

Infrastructure is an obstacle. Six hundred million Africans, or four in 10, lack electricity. An average American refrigerator consumes more power in a year than a typical person in Africa. Major roads and railways often lead to the coasts, a legacy of extractive colonialism, which inhibits trade between countries.

And the baby boom endures, smothering economic growth.

Other regions, like East Asia, prospered only after their birthrates had fallen substantially and a majority of their people had joined the work force — a phenomenon known as the “demographic transition” that has long driven global growth. Britain’s transition took two centuries, from the 1740s to the 1940s. Thailand did it in about 40 years.

But in Africa, where birthrates remain stubbornly high — nearly twice the global average — that transition has proved elusive.

The picture changes greatly from one country to another. In South Africa, women have two children on average, while in Niger they have seven. Some smaller economies, like those of Rwanda and Ivory Coast, are among the world’s fastest growing. But on the whole, the continent cannot keep pace with its swelling population.

Adjusted for population size, Africa’s economy has grown by 1 percent annually since 1990, according to the global consulting firm McKinsey & Company. Over the same period, India’s grew 5 percent per year and China’s grew 9 percent.

Despite making up 18 percent of the global population, Africa accounts for just 3 percent of all trade.

For legions of jobless and frustrated young Africans, that leaves only one good option: Get out. Every year, tens of thousands of doctors, nurses, academics and other skilled migrants flee the continent. (At least one million Africans from south of the Sahara have moved to Europe since 2010, according to the Pew Research Center.) Migration is such a feature of life in Nigeria that young people have a name for it — “japa,” Yoruba slang that means “to run away.”

And the countries they leave behind depend on them to survive. In 2021, African migrants sent home $96 billion in remittances, three times more than the sum of all foreign aid, according to the African Development Bank.

“The African diaspora has become the largest financier of Africa,” said Akinwumi Adesina, the bank’s head.

In fact, the majority of young migrants do not even leave the continent, moving instead to other countries in Africa. But the plight of those who gamble their lives to travel further — left to die in sinking boats by the Greek Coast Guard, gunned down by Saudi border police or even stumbling through Central American jungle to reach the United States — has become a potent emblem of generational desperation.

The new big idea to invigorate African economies is the transition to green energy. African governments and investors are angling for a piece of the global effort, sure to involve trillions of dollars in the coming decades, which they hope can deliver Africa’s much-sought-after industrial revolution.

Africa has 60 percent of the world’s solar energy potential and 70 percent of its cobalt, a key mineral for making electric vehicles. Its tropical rainforests pull more carbon from the atmosphere than the Amazon. Ambitious ventures are taking shape in numerous countries: a dazzling solar tower in Morocco; a $10 billion green hydrogen plant in Namibia; a Kenyan-made machine that extracts carbon from the air.

The Africa Climate Summit, which took place in Nairobi in September, not only galvanized those seeking to profit from the climate transition, it also produced a bullish new narrative.

“Africa is neither poor nor desperate,” President William Ruto of Kenya said.

Whether young Africans can truly tap the potential of the coming energy revolution depends on other factors, too, not least the capacities of their entrenched and aging leaders.

Young Voters, Old Leaders

A youthful continent is run by old men. The average African leader is 63 years old; the oldest, President Paul Biya of Cameroon, is 90, a full 72 years older than the average Cameroonian. Under their grip, democracy has fallen to its lowest point in decades: Half of all Africans live in countries considered “not free” by Freedom House.

Five African heads of state, including Mr. Biya, have held power for more than three decades; nearly all are grooming their sons as successors. “Sick old men,” said the Nigerian writer and Nobel laureate, Wole Soyinka, in an interview.

Even so, foreign powers are scrambling to back them.

President Paul Kagame of Rwanda, in power since 1994, receives over $1 billion in Western aid annually, and has established his tiny country as a hub for sports and international conferences — even as he is accused of killing or kidnapping his critics, or purports to win elections by a margin of 99 percent.

As the United States, China and Russia vie for position, an array of middle powers is crowding in too. About 400 new embassies have opened in African countries since 2012, according to the Diplometrics Program at the University of Denver; Turkey, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and India top the list.

Yet there is one key group that Africa’s gerontocrats have disastrously failed to win over: the alienated youth of their own nations.

“Our elites treat us like idiots,” Nourdine Aouadé, a lawyer and young political leader, said at his office in Niger’s capital, Niamey, after a military takeover in August. Like many young Nigeriens, Mr. Awade, 32, supported the action.

“Coups are just the consequence of social injustice,” he said.

Senegal Kenya Kenya Most young Africans admire and desire democracy, numerous polls have found. Male students in a university dorm room, sitting on wooden bunk beds and looking at laptops together. But disillusionment with politicians’ empty promises is giving rise to a new age of protest Young men throwing rocks, next to an overturned car in an urban shantytown. and to political activism, like these performance artists focused on climate change. Three people standing upright in rubble next to a patched corrugated iron building. They are wearing uniforms with straps crossing in X’s over their chests and small potted trees balanced on their heads.

Youthful uprisings first flared in 2011, during the Arab Spring, when an uprising in Tunisia inspired others in Egypt and Libya. Later, powerful demonstrations erupted in Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Senegal and even Eswatini, a tiny kingdom of 1.2 million people in southern Africa.

This year, young people have channeled their anger into pro-military populism — cheering the new junta in Niger or, weeks later, Gabon, where they posted TikTok videos mocking their newly ousted president, Ali Bongo Ondimba. Other leaders, watching nervously, worry that they could be next.

The age gap between geriatric leaders and restless youth is “a major source of tension” in many African countries, said Simon Mulongo, a former African Union diplomat from Uganda. “It’s a powder keg, and it can explode anytime.”

One day last spring, Nuha Abdelgadir was hunched over her phone at a cafe in Sudan’s capital, Khartoum. Her thumb flicked restlessly through a gallery of smiling faces — friends who had been killed by Sudan’s security forces in pro-democracy demonstrations. Ms. Abdelgadir, 18, had come to take their place.

“We’re equal with the boys,” she said, gesturing to another young woman. “We’ve got shields, we throw stones, we clash.”

Her group, “Anger Without Limits,” was at the fore of the street clashes that had occurred every week since Sudan’s military had seized power in a coup 18 months earlier. Ms. Abdelgadir’s job was to pluck streaming tear-gas canisters from the ground and fling them back at the police. It was risky work, she admitted; over 100 protesters had been killed. But, she said, “I don’t care.”

Weeks later, Sudan tumbled into war. Fighting between rival military factions in mid-April rippled across Khartoum, then the country. On the third day of fighting, a stray shell punched through Ms. Abdelgadir’s home, sending it up in flames. She fled with her family to the countryside. By September, she was planning to leave Sudan, and even the continent.

Even then, she insisted she would be back to finish what she had started. “We will take to the streets again,” she texted, the night before boarding a bus taking her over Sudan’s border into Ethiopia. “The democracy we dream of will come.”

Militants Spreading

While some take flight, others pick up a gun.

In the Sahel, the semiarid region bordering the Sahara that runs across the African continent, tens of thousands of teenagers have joined militant groups linked to Al Qaeda and Islamic State. They bring havoc in their wake — thousands of civilians killed, five million forced from their homes and political destabilization that has led to a string of military coups.

But the main driver of this powerful insurgency is not an extremist ideology or religious belief, according to a U.N. study of 1,000 former fighters from eight countries. Instead, researchers found, the single biggest reason for joining a militant group was the simple desire to have a job.

Modu Ali, from a poor family with 10 children in northern Nigeria, had barely finished primary school when he joined the extremist group Boko Haram, over a decade ago. His goal was to “fight for the rights of the deprived,” he said. “Instead it ruined my life.” He surrendered and joined a rehabilitation program for former fighters.

The Sahel leads the world in two ways. It is the global center of extremist violence, accounting for 43 percent of all such deaths in 2022, according to the Global Terrorism Index. And it has the highest birthrates — on average seven children per woman in Niger and northern Nigeria, six in Mali and Chad, and five in Sudan and Burkina Faso.

Nigeria Nigeria Morocco High birthrates alone do not cause insurgencies. Women in hijabs and flowing dresses, many holding babies and children, waiting at a maternity clinic. But they are a major accelerant when combined with weak states and deep poverty. A boy holding an axe over his head, chopping wood in a pen holding longhorn cattle. A warming planet is also a major factor, erasing livelihoods and driving people to desperation. Young boys sitting on a small wooden boat that is stranded on a cracked, dry riverbed.

These factors are why many view the Sahel as the most worrisome manifestation of Africa’s “youthquake.”

One key to tackling that problem lies with teenage girls like Asiya Saidu.

Like many in Zaria, a Muslim-majority city in northern Nigeria, Ms. Saidu expected to be married by 14 and to have her first child soon after. “My uncle was hellbent on finding me a husband,” she recalled.

Instead, she enrolled at the Center for Girls Education, an American-funded program that has helped as many as 70,000 girls to stay in school, and ultimately to have smaller families.

Educating girls has an unusually large effect on family size in Africa because it delays the age of marriage and helps young women to space out their children, researchers have found. “It’s a natural kind of birth control,” said Habiba Mohammed, the program’s director.

Ms. Saidu, now 17, recently applied for nursing school.

“I do want to get married,” she said. But first, she said, “I want to be independent and learn to support myself.”

The Future Is Already Here

It could be that Africa will undergo transformations that are hard to see now.

When the economist Ha-Joon Chang was growing up in South Korea in the 1960s, his country was subjected to the same condescension and racism leveled at many African nations today, he said. It was poor, had just emerged from war, and was seen by American officials as a basket case.

“Nobody took us seriously,” said Mr. Chang, now a professor of economics at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London.

That South Korea has become one of the world’s largest economies shows how success can strike in the most unlikely places, Mr. Chang added: “With time and effort, remarkable transformations are possible.”

A young population was a big part of South Korea’s success, Mr. Chang said. But it took other ingredients, too: visionary leaders, wise policies and education, as well as intangibles like drive, innovation and sheer good fortune, he said. “A lot of things have to work together.”

Could Africa’s youth boom portend a similar miracle?

This year’s surging turmoil — new crises, new wars and new economic slumps — would give pause to the greatest of optimists. Yet there are also reasons to hope.

“I tell my friends in England that the time will come when they will put out a red carpet for those guys now coming in boats,” said Mr. Ibrahim, the philanthropist.

Reflections create streaks of light across the window. that will shape their future, and the world’s. A young man skateboarding in the air on a skateboard, as he skates down a ramp

Some, like Nedye Astou Touré, are already reaching for the stars.

Ms. Touré, a 23-year-old student, stood over a pile of old aircraft parts at a university lab in Dakar, the capital of Senegal. Her eyes gleamed with anticipation. “It’s for a rocket,” she said of the pile.

She and another senior at the university hope to launch their projectile 100 meters into the air, a first step toward building a low-orbit satellite.

It might take a while, Ms. Touré admitted. But while others with such grand dreams have typically left Africa behind, she wanted to show it can be done at home.

“Just wait,” she said. “Three years from now you might be hearing about us.”"

Price increases have slowed. Covid deaths are down about 80 percent compared with a year ago. Ukraine is holding off Russia’s invasion. Congress passed legislation addressing climate change, infrastructure and gun violence, and some of it was bipartisan.

What Biden did not emphasize last night was that the U.S. also faces a lot of uncertainty. Depending on what happens over the next few months, the current moment may end up looking like a temporary high point for the country and Biden’s presidency — or another step toward better times. Today’s newsletter provides a fuller picture of the state of the union, looking at four topics that will shape 2023.

After those four, we will also give you the highlights from Biden’s speech and reactions to it.

Republican House

Biden spent much of his speech celebrating bipartisan accomplishments from the last year, including funding for scientific research, electoral overhaul and same-sex marriage protections. “We’re often told that Democrats and Republicans can’t work together,” Biden said. “But over the past two years, we’ve proved the cynics and naysayers wrong.”"

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have both visited Beijing in recent weeks partly to improve communication between the two countries. “President Biden and I do not see the relationship between the U.S. and China through the frame of great-power conflict,” Yellen said at the end of her trip.

But the underlying reality is unchanged: The U.S. and China remain competitors for global supremacy. The two countries are great powers, and they are often in conflict.

Look at what’s happened since Yellen returned home on Sunday:

U.S. officials announced that in the run-up to Blinken’s trip last month, hackers apparently affiliated with the Chinese government broke into the email accounts of top U.S. officials, including Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, a noted critic of China’s policies. The spy balloon that flew over the U.S. early this year may have received more attention, but the hacking of high-level email accounts seems more belligerent.

Biden administration officials appear close to announcing rules restricting American firms from investing in many cutting-edge Chinese technology companies. Advocates say the rules are intended to keep Americans from financing threats to U.S. national security. Biden’s aides have held off on announcing the policy, partly to avoid disrupting the recent diplomatic outreach. (Here is a Times story with more details.)

The U.S. continues to enforce a strict set of restrictions intended to hamper China’s ability to produce advanced semiconductors. The Biden administration put the restrictions in place Oct. 7. “If you’d told me about these rules five years ago, I would’ve told you that’s an act of war — we’d have to be at war,” said C.J. Muse, a semiconductor expert at Evercore ISI, an investment advisory firm.

Choke points

Muse’s quotation comes from a new Times Magazine article by Alex Palmer, and I recommend making time to read it this weekend. The article explains how the Biden administration is trying to prevent China from getting access to cutting-edge semiconductors, which are vital to many digital technologies. By doing so, the U.S. hopes to slow China’s efforts to build advanced weapons, develop artificial intelligence and surveil its own citizens and people in other countries.

The U.S. believes it can succeed, Alex writes, because the semiconductor industry is “a web of mutual interdependence, spread all over the planet in highly specialized regions and companies, its feats made possible by supply chains of exceptional length and complexity.” The most advanced operations tend to be located in either the U.S. or its allies, such as Japan, the Netherlands and Taiwan — three governments that have all signed on to the Oct. 7 restrictions."

In the same amount of time, a German citizen might vote in six to eight races.

Put simply, the U.S. has an unusually high number of elections. The federal government alone holds elections every two years, compared with around every four or five years in other advanced democracies.

Why does this matter? Some experts argue that the saturation of elections has significant downsides — exhausting voters and hurting the quality of governance by pushing lawmakers toward more campaigning, fund-raising and short-term thinking.

But more frequent elections also offer voters more opportunities to hold officials accountable. Experts characterized elections as a balancing act: Too many can overwhelm the public and lawmakers, while too few provide insufficient chances for accountability."

Global markets are showing red on Thursday as investors grow concerned about just how far central banks will push up interest rates to tame inflation. The Bank of England on Thursday raised its prime lending rate by 0.5 percentage points, and the European Central Bank is expected to follow suit with a similar increase.

The market volatility was on full display on Wednesday in the U.S. Stocks jumped at the open as investors anticipated that Jay Powell, the Fed chair, would signal that the central bank would soon pull back on its policy of aggressive rate increases. But he did the opposite, and stocks slumped.

In his afternoon news conference, Mr. Powell said emphatically that “we have more to do” to bring inflation down to the Fed’s target rate of 2 percent. The Fed now forecasts it will raise its policy interest rate to 5.1 percent by the end of 2023. (It’s currently set to a range between 4.25 to 4.5 percent.)

Many on Wall Street still think the Fed won’t go that far. “This aggressive hiking cycle is going to cause some damage,” Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in an investor note on Wednesday evening. (RBC thinks the Fed will cut rates twice next year.) Meanwhile, Bill Ackman, the widely followed hedge fund billionaire, tweeted Wednesday that the Fed’s 2 percent inflation target “is no longer credible.”"

President Biden escalated his confrontation with China today by banning American investments in key Chinese tech industries that could enhance Beijing’s military and surveillance capabilities.

The proposed rules would apply to U.S. private equity and venture capital firms investing in quantum computing, artificial intelligence and advanced semiconductors. U.S. firms investing in a broader range of Chinese industries would also be required to report their activity.

The White House has recently sought to calm relations with China. At the same time, it has pushed to develop suppliers outside China, and ramped up restrictions on selling the country technologies like semiconductors for advanced computing.

Investments between the U.S. and China have fallen sharply in the past few years. But venture capital and private equity firms have continued to seek out lucrative opportunities for partnerships as a way to gain access to China’s vibrant tech industry."

But is this shift permanent? Can anything be done to assuage rural rage?

The answer will depend on two things: whether it’s possible to improve rural lives and restore rural communities, and whether the voters in these communities will give politicians credit for any improvements that do take place.

This week my colleague Thomas B. Edsall surveyed research on the rural Republican shift. I was struck by his summary of work by Katherine J. Cramer, who attributes rural resentment to perceptions that rural areas are ignored by policymakers, don’t get their fair share of resources and are disrespected by “city folks.”

As it happens, all three perceptions are largely wrong. I’m sure that my saying this will generate a tidal wave of hate mail, and lecturing rural Americans about policy reality isn’t going to move their votes. Nonetheless, it’s important to get our facts straight."

Despite her achievements, Ms. Grant acknowledged that she was not the obvious choice for a position that concerns policy, raw materials and manufacturing. “I was definitely a wild card candidate,” she said during a phone interview, but added that she views the role as an extension of her creative life and fascination with the category. “In the interview, someone asked me, ‘You’re a writer, why would you want to do this job?’ For me, it’s another way to love jewelry.”

Addressing questions of environmental responsibility is one way she wants to put that love into action. “The sustainability of jewelry is the biggest single issue we’re looking at as an industry,” she said. “One of the reasons I’m excited is because I want to know what I can do.” Part of her objective is to “simplify” the process of adopting environmentally conscious practices to make those practices “accessible to more people.”

Initially, she will be working on developing new guidelines for lab-grown materials, and tackling “an ambitious international project in the pipeline for this summer,” Mr. Bouffard wrote.

Ms. Grant said that, to facilitate her work, she planned to learn the technical side of the business, including mining and gem cutting. “I’m hoping for a bit of immersion,” she said. “I want people on the ground to tell me what it really is.” And, she said, continuing to promote diversity will be a priority because it is important to support “women, Black and brown people, people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, people who don’t have the background, the connections, the family influence.”"

Public Art, Digital Art and the Climate Crisis

More and more artists are creating and presenting works in very public places accessible to all — including the digital space — to raise awareness about the climate crisis. Some of these projects have garnered international attention, but to what extent have they led to action?

Hans Ulrich Obrist, artistic director, Serpentine Gallery; Ernesto Neto, artist; Giorgia Abeltino, senior director, Public Policy, Google Arts & Culture. Moderated by Matthew Anderson, European culture editor, The New York Times.

Matthew Anderson: Hans Ulrich, we’ve been talking a lot about how the climate affects the content of the art. But as someone who leads an institution, I think there’s a growing awareness that the way that art museums, institutions, run is also itself kind of quite polluting, carbon-intensive. It’s not good enough just to put on programs that talk about the climate, but we need to take action in terms of how we run our institutions and organize them. And I wondered if you could say a bit about how that is affecting your thinking at the Serpentine.

Hans Ulrich Obrist: I think there are many different steps we’re taking. First of all, of course, as always, it comes out of collaboration with artists. So at the moment, we’re working with Tomás Saraceno on a project where Tomás will switch off the air-conditioning for the summer. So this summer, from June to October, there won’t be air-conditioning during his exhibition. He’s also positioning a series of solar panels on the roof, and the videos will only work through that.

He has also called for the creation of a governance regime modeled on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to make the work of private companies in A.I. more transparent.

Such agreements may be difficult to achieve at a time of growing global tensions, but they are timely as lawmakers unveil proposals about how A.I. should be overseen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate leader, will meet top tech executives, including Elon Musk and Satya Nadella, the C.E.O. of Microsoft, this week to discuss regulations.

Mr. Suleyman spoke to DealBook about his book, which was released last week. This conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.

Why write a book — a very analogue approach — to outline your ideas?

It is a form of radical accountability. I want to be able to look back in a decade and see if my predictions were correct. And doing that on the record is intellectually very honest and healthy, rather than doing it in a series of tweets, blog posts and op-eds.

Why do you describe the book as a “love letter” to the nation-state?

It’s a wake-up call to policymakers, politicians and citizens. We have invented a system of noncommercial checks and balances which holds centralized power accountable in the public interest. That system has evolved over many years away from monarchy, dictatorship and authoritarianism toward free and open liberal democracy. It means that we can do sensible taxation and redistribution to prevent inequality. This is the best tool we have, so we should stick with it and keep trying to defend it."

Mr. Trinidad’s company, 99th Floor, has held dozens of cannabis dinners over the years. The food is as ornate as anything at a high-end New York restaurant, the open kitchen as professionally run, the service as intelligent. This is a long way from 99th Floor’s 2015 origins, which shared the organizing principle of a rave: The location of the dinner would often not be revealed until the day of the event.

These days, marijuana is much more mainstream; just blocks away from one of Mr. Trinidad’s elegant dinners, weed trucks perfumed the air of Bedford Avenue. Still, legislation governing the commercial sale and use of cannabis is a work in progress, forcing cannabis cooks to work in what is commonly termed the “gray area.”

Confusion and uncertainty pervaded Russia yesterday, with neither Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, nor Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of a mercenary force known as Wagner, appearing in public the day after an open military rebellion led by Prigozhin appeared defused. (Here’s how the mutiny unfolded.)

Prigozhin called off the mercenaries after staging an armed uprising against the military’s leadership for nearly 24 hours over the weekend. But the damage had been done, not least because his criticism of the military leaders as incompetent included questioning the Kremlin’s justifications for invading Ukraine in the first place.

Even as state television tried to trumpet the fact that Russian unity and “maturity” had prevailed, independent commentators in Russia and world leaders elsewhere concluded that the rebellion had revealed cracks in Putin’s hold on power. The deal that ultimately defused the hostilities was credited to Belarus’s leader, Aleksandr Lukashenko, a Putin ally.

Scenes: Russians watched with alarm as Prigozhin’s armored vehicles inched ever closer to Moscow with little armed opposition, raising the specter of a civil war in the nuclear-armed state. In Rostov-on-Don, residents cheered and embraced the mercenaries as they left on Saturday."

He was 84.

The death, at a hospital, was caused by a brain hemorrhage, his daughter Karen Daly Junker said.

Dr. Daly, an ecological economist, was almost surely his field’s chief popularizer through his more than a dozen books and many journal articles, his faculty positions at the University of Maryland and, earlier, Louisiana State University, and his somewhat incongruous six-year stint at the World Bank.

Although he was branded a heretic for his theories — or, worse, ignored — among traditional economists, he had plenty of adherents, who saw him as prophetic for anticipating climate change’s increasingly harmful impact and the vast sums of money needed to address it.

“His ideas are really relevant now, unlike most other economists, whose ideas tend to lose relevance as time passes and circumstances change,” Peter A. Victor, an ecological economist and the author of the 2021 biography “Herman Daly’s Economics for a Full World,” said in a phone interview."

Donald Trump is expected to arrive in New York today from his estate in Florida and head to his former home in Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, before surrendering at the office of the Manhattan district attorney early tomorrow afternoon. He will then be arraigned in the Manhattan Criminal Courts Building.

The exact charges have not been unsealed yet, though they are linked to a payment made in 2016 to buy the silence of a porn star, Stormy Daniels, who says she had a brief sexual relationship with Trump in 2006. Prosecutors are expected to accuse Trump of falsifying records related to reimbursements to his former fixer, who had paid the hush money to Daniels.

Even for a city accustomed to celebrity appearances, Trump’s two-day visit is likely to be a striking spectacle. New York City officials and the police were already girding for protests near the courthouse and outside Trump Tower, where barricades lined the streets for several blocks surrounding the building.

But a U.S. official said yesterday that the administration “has not seen credible evidence of any diversion of U.S.-provided weapons outside of Ukraine.” Biden administration officials also say that the recent crackdown shows that President Volodymyr Zelensky is committed to fighting the problem.

“I would like to remind these people that backwardness is useless,” Francis, 86, told a group of fellow Jesuits early this month in a meeting at World Youth Day celebrations in Lisbon. “Doing this, you lose the true tradition and you turn to ideologies to have support. In other words, ideologies replace faith.”

While Democrats again and again voted unanimously for Hakeem Jeffries, Kevin McCarthy endured insult after insult from his side of the aisle. Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, mocked Mr. McCarthy for having “sold shares of himself” to win the speaker’s job. Tucker Carlson said Mr. McCarthy’s “real constituency is the lobbying community in Washington.” A poll last month by Monmouth University found that Mr. McCarthy had a net approval rating of only 9 percent among Republicans. By contrast, his predecessor Nancy Pelosi had a net approval rating of 59 percent among Democrats.

It’s not just Mr. McCarthy. According to that same poll, the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, has a net approval rating of negative 23 percent among his fellow Republicans, while the majority leader, Chuck Schumer, has a net rating of positive 33 among his fellow Democrats. The Republican disdain for the people who lead them on Capitol Hill is nothing new: At the 2016 Republican National Convention, Mr. McConnell was booed. When John Boehner, Republican of Ohio, left the speakership in 2015, his approval rating was underwater in his party, too. Eric Cantor, the former House majority leader once considered the leading candidate to replace Mr. Boehner, was defeated for re-election in 2014 by a right-wing insurgent who spent only about $200,000 on his campaign.

Why are Republicans so much more dissatisfied than Democrats with their congressional leaders? It’s not as if those leaders have been markedly less effective. Sure, Democrats have passed big spending and environmental bills during Joe Biden’s presidency. But while Donald Trump was president, congressional Republicans enacted a huge tax cut. They also engineered a transformation of the Supreme Court that is likely to tilt federal policy to the right for decades. No one can credibly claim that Mr. McConnell is a lousy legislative strategist."

They were getting questions about the heat, about how they could fit the games in a country smaller than Connecticut and whether they would allow alcohol.

When FIFA’s president at the time opened the envelope and Qatar’s name came out, immediately everyone zeroed in on corruption. The investigations that followed forced FIFA to change the way it designated a host, and revealed how a country was able to bend the world to its will through force of cash.

You arrived in Qatar last week. What are you seeing?

Everything here feels shiny and newly built. It’s like a country with that new car smell. The clearest thing is that it is baking hot — and this is close to winter. There is very strong sunlight bouncing off concrete that’s been laid down for all the new buildings. They’ve also banned the sale of beer to fans in stadiums.

How has Qatar pulled off its preparation? Talk us through the controversy surrounding this tournament.

They essentially had to rebuild an entire country in 12 years to host this one-month event. They amassed hundreds of thousands of overseas workers, particularly South Asian workers, to do this construction. Thousands of those workers have died in Qatar since 2010, the year the country won hosting rights, according to human rights groups. Many more were injured building or refurbishing these eight air-conditioned stadiums, which Qatar will have little use for after the World Cup.

I frequently edit the scientific articles and grant proposals that he and the postdoctoral researchers working under him write. I used to be happy to help him in this way, but lately I have begun to feel that this favor is just another way that the university benefits from my work — and the work of many humanities adjuncts — without fair compensation.

The discrepancy between the salaries my husband and I receive makes it abundantly clear that the university reveres the sciences (a field dominated by men) and neglects the humanities (a field dominated by women, particularly at the adjunct level). When my husband publishes an article or receives a grant, the university gets money and recognition, and yet I am not compensated for my role in this achievement. My editing is not trivial work; one article or proposal can take hours, which is time that I could otherwise spend on teaching or trying to advance my own research. Why shouldn’t I be compensated for my specialized contribution to his scholarship? For me, this is not an intellectual question; it has begun to make my blood boil.

On the other hand, as a researcher at a public university, my husband has limited access to funding that he could use to pay another editor and, as a pre-tenure faculty member, is in a somewhat vulnerable position himself. Should I help him as a loving partner, or only do editing work for paying customers? — Name Withheld

From the Ethicist:

I’m not sure marriage is the right arena to fight the many genuine inequities in the system of rewards you’ll find in the university, and in our larger society. Even leaving love and devotion out of account, you have an interest in your husband’s getting tenure. You ask why you shouldn’t be compensated for your contribution. The problem is that in an institution like a university, it’s not appropriate for someone to supervise paid work performed by a spouse, and nobody else is in a position to do so.

But the crucial question of how to pay for the momentous shift in national priorities remains. In France, for instance, government spending as a percentage of the economy, at 1.4 trillion euros ($1.54 trillion), is the highest in Europe. Of that, nearly half was spent on the nation’s generous social safety net, which includes unemployment benefits and pensions. Debt has also spiraled in the wake of the pandemic. Yet Mr. Macron has vowed not to increase what is already one of the highest tax levels in Europe for fear of scaring off investors.

Debates over competing priorities are playing out in other capitals across the region — even if the trade-offs are not explicitly mentioned.

In Britain, on the same day in March that the government unveiled a budget that included a $6.25 billion bump in military spending, teachers, doctors and transport workers joined strikes over pay and working conditions. It was just one in a series of walkouts by public workers who complained that underfunding, double-digit inflation and the pandemic’s aftermath have crippled essential services like health care, transportation and education. The budget included a $4.1 billion increase for the National Health Service over the same two-year period.

Romania, which has been running up its public debt over the years, has pledged to lift military spending this year by 0.5 percent of national output. And this month it agreed to buy an undisclosed number of F-35 fighter jets, which have a list price of $80 million a piece. While the increase will enable the country to hit NATO’s budget target, it will undercut efforts to meet the debt limits set by the European Union."

Researchers believe that the country’s official figure, as of Feb. 9, of 83,150 deaths during the entire pandemic is a vast undercount. That number would give China the lowest death rate per capita of any major country over the whole of the pandemic.

So how do you know when it’s safe to venture out?

“No matter what the extreme weather situation is, there are usually a few practical steps you can take” to reduce your risk, said Alex Lamers, an extreme weather expert at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Here are the things to consider before you head out the door.

Extreme heat

Extreme heat leads to hundreds of fatalities a year in the U.S. That is in large part because high temperatures are taxing on the body, even for short periods of time, said Dr. John Balbus, acting director of the office of climate change and health equity at the Department of Health and Human Services. Before you go out on a very hot day, make a plan for how you’re going to protect yourself.

What to check for:



Temperature alone isn’t enough information to gauge health risk; the body struggles more to cool itself in humid conditions. The heat index, which combines temperature and humidity, is a more accurate measure of what heat feels like. The higher the heat index temperature, the more dangerous it is to go outside. A heat index of 103 degrees Fahrenheit and above is dangerous; you’re likely to experience heat cramps and heat exhaustion, and heat stroke is possible if you’re outside for a prolonged period or doing something strenuous, according to the National Weather Service."

Companies flourished by inflating their scope and ambition to feed the desire for magical thinking. WeWork, a mundane business that provided flexible work spaces, was portrayed as a spiritual enterprise that would remake the human condition. Its valuation soared, obscuring the questionable activities of its founders. Facebook and Google reconceived themselves as technological powerhouses, rebranding as Meta and Alphabet, respectively. They sought broad capabilities that they could flex at will in the metaverse or with their “moonshot projects” when, in fact, they are prosaic (if extremely effective) advertising businesses. They are now struggling with many of their fantastical efforts.

Most broadly, many corporations have come to embrace broader social missions in response to the desire of younger investors and employees to use their capital and employment as instruments for social change. Another manifestation of magical thinking is believing that the best hopes for progress on our greatest challenges — climate change, racial injustice and economic inequality — are corporations and individual investment and consumption choices rather than political mobilization and our communities.

I confess that this screed reflects my own experience. For the past decade, being a finance professor meant being asked about crypto or about novel valuation methods for unprofitable companies — and being smiled at (and ignored) when I would counter with traditional instincts. Every business problem, I am told, can be solved in radically new and effective ways by applying artificial intelligence to ever-increasing amounts of data with a dash of design thinking. Many graduates coming of age in this period of financial giddiness and widening corporate ambition have been taught to chase these glittery objects with their human and financial capital instead of investing in sustainable paths — a habit that will be harder to instill at later ages.

Embracing novelty and ambition in the face of huge problems is to be lauded, but the unhinged variety of these admirable traits that we have seen so much of in recent years is counterproductive. The fundamentals of business have not changed merely because of new technologies or low interest rates. The way to prosper is still by solving problems in new ways that sustainably deliver value to employees, capital providers and customers. Over-promising the scope of change created by technology and the possibilities of business and finance to a new generation will lead only to disaffection as these promises falter. All those new investors and crypto owners may nurse a grudge against capitalism, rather than understand the perverse world they were born into.

The end of magical thinking is upon us as cryptocurrencies and valuations are collapsing — and that is good news. Vested interests will resist that trend by continuing to propagate fictions. But rising rates and a return to more routine business cycles will continue to provide the rude awakening that began in 2022."

Frustrated over the country’s military leadership, Prigozhin instigated a short rebellion two months ago with his Wagner forces that posed a threat to President Vladimir Putin. Despite his actions, he appeared to move about freely in the mutiny’s aftermath, including meeting with the president on June 29.

A falling out: After years of supporting Putin, Prigozhin began to openly criticize the Russian government. Here’s what changed and when."

Lacy and delicate, sea dragons live only in the waters along Australia’s southern coast, and their small habitat and limited range make them an ideal candidate for in-captivity breeding.

Since 2008, the aquarists have tried to replicate the sea dragons’ natural habitat. They have changed the temperature of the sea dragon tank to match the seasons of the southern hemisphere. They have adjusted the amount of light in the exhibit. They got a taller tank. None of it worked.

“I had kind of given up and thought it’s never going to happen,” said Jeremy Brodt, an aquarist and galleries manager at the New England Aquarium.

And then, “out of the blue,” Mr. Brodt said, “it happened.”

Last May, aquarium staff members discovered that a male weedy sea dragon was successfully carrying his mate’s eggs. The aquarium announced on Wednesday that the eggs had hatched in mid-July, and that aquarists have been raising 18 baby dragons since then."

When North Korea launched a rocket carrying its first military reconnaissance satellite yesterday, it triggered evacuation alerts in South Korea that were followed shortly after by a new wave of messages saying that the earlier notice was a “false alarm.”

For half an hour, confusion and panic swept across Seoul. Then that anxiety turned into anger and exasperation.

The launch was later described by North Korean officials as a failure. But for South Koreans, who have grown inured to the North’s frequent provocations, their government’s reaction was a disturbing sign that it was unprepared to handle a real emergency.

“They messed up big time,” said an office worker in Seoul who woke up to the sirens.

Details: South Korea issued an evacuation alert on Baekryeongdo, an island near the northwestern border with the North, but officials were investigating why the same alert was also issued to Seoul, even though the rocket flew hundreds of kilometers west of the city. Officials in Seoul said they decided to issue an alert in the city as a precaution. The mayor of Seoul later issued a public apology."

If you choose to drive into Manhattan during that rush, you add to that backup. You probably add only slightly, maybe less than a second, to the delay facing each driver behind you — but there may be thousands of people in the queue, so the total cost you impose, in wasted time and fuel, is substantial. You probably impose less cost on the bus passengers who seem to make up most of the people using the tunnel, because many buses can bypass much of the inbound jam using a dedicated lane, but there isn’t anything comparable for the outbound commute, so if you drive into and out of Manhattan, you’re imposing big delays on everyone.

And of course, the congestion you create by driving into the busiest part of Manhattan is just beginning when you’ve exited the tunnel.

Informed of the topic, she curtly shook her head.

“Don’t care,” she said.

The city’s history helps explain its deep veins of indifference, said Brooke Barbier, a historian who also offers guided tours of Boston. Because its identity is so rooted in the American Revolution and its rejection of monarchy, and because its landscape is still littered with vivid reminders of that past, “it makes sense, even centuries later, that Boston can’t care about the monarchy,” she said. “Even if, secretly, they care.”

Commuters cross the site of the Boston Massacre on their way to the subway (the place where it happened, then King Street, was later renamed); at the Boston Tea Party Ships and Museum, actors routinely re-enact the colonists’ famous 1773 protest against British taxation.

Fans of the first-place Boston Celtics seemed to channel vestiges of that feistiness on Wednesday night, when William and Kate attended a game at TD Garden alongside city officials, and were reportedly met with scattered chants of “USA!

Childhood romps in New England’s wilderness provided her with the template for Jo March, the central character of her best-selling 1868 novel “Little Women.” Miles argues that Jo, the hardheaded “wild girl” who refused to be domesticated, was a cathartic projection of the rebellion against restrictions on female behavior that Alcott and other 19th-century women could never fully express in their own lives.

Nearly three decades after “Little Women” was published, the sport of basketball began to spread quickly through American educational institutions, including the Fort Shaw Indian School, a federal boarding school in Montana, where it was taught to female students. Miles offers a rollicking account of the unsung heroines of Fort Shaw’s girls’ team. Under the direction of Josephine Langley, a young Indigenous woman and accomplished player, the team flourished. Talented and exciting to watch, it beat teams in towns across Montana and thrilled crowds during exhibition games at the 1904 St. Louis World’s Fair. Basketball allowed the Fort Shaw girls to break free, for a time, from the strict regimentation of the boarding school system. As sportswomen, they defied presumptions about female weakness and Indigenous “physical and mental fitness.”

“Wild Girls” ends with a discussion of modern women, including an analysis of the science-fiction writer Octavia Butler’s percipient warnings about climate change. In an epilogue, Miles reflects on how Covid-19 highlighted inequities in access to outdoor space, underscoring our failure to ensure that all children are given a chance to thrive in the natural world.

Her book arrives at a time when large swaths of the country have been overrun by deadly fires, racked by relentless heat and parched by drought. The battering of the environment has coincided with an attack on women’s rights. “Wild Girls” reframes hard-fought battles for women’s equality through the lens of empowerment provided by the natural world. It begs us to acknowledge the primacy of the earth not only in historical lives but in our own as well. “The trail is calling,” Miles writes. “Are you ready?”"

On the other hand, Republican governors from places like Georgia, Virginia and New Hampshire often have a different story to tell. They are running growing, prospering states. (Seven of the 10 fastest growing states have Republican governors while eight of the 10 fastest shrinking states have Democratic governors.)

So their stories are not about the left behind; they can tell stories about the places people are leaving for. Their most appealing narrative is: Jobs and people are coming to us, we’ve got the better model, we’re providing businesslike leadership to keep it going.

These different narratives yield different political messages. The bellicose populists put culture war issues front and center. The conservative governors certainly play the values card, especially when schools try to usurp the role of parents, but they are strongest when emphasizing pocketbook issues and quality of life issues."

The famously jittery Bankman-Fried, who was arrested on Monday night on fraud charges, looked relatively subdued as he Zoomed in for the interview from a dimly lit room in the Bahamas, a tax haven whose regulatory environment was particularly suited to his crypto ambitions.

“Look, there are a lot of things that I think have really a massive impact on the world,” Bankman-Fried said. “And ultimately that’s what I care about the most. And, I mean, I think frankly that the blockchain industry could have a substantial positive impact. I was thinking a lot about, you know, bed nets and malaria, about, you know, saving people from diseases no one should die from.”

This is the language of effective altruism — or E.A. — a philanthropic movement premised on the use of reason and data to do good. Bankman-Fried had long flaunted his E.A. bona fides to distinguish himself from other crypto billionaires. Earn a lot to give a lot. Direct your bounty to where it will matter the most. Now his crypto exchange, FTX, has collapsed, wiping out small investors and wreaking havoc in the industry. To hear Bankman-Fried tell it, the idea was to make billions through his crypto-trading firm, Alameda Research, and FTX, the exchange he created for it — funneling the proceeds into the humble cause of “bed nets and malaria,” thereby saving poor people’s lives.

But last summer Bankman-Fried was telling The New Yorker’s Gideon Lewis-Kraus something quite different. “He told me that he never had a bed-nets phase, and considered neartermist causes — global health and poverty — to be more emotionally driven,” Lewis-Kraus wrote in August. Effective altruists talk about both “neartermism” and “longtermism.” Bankman-Fried said he wanted his money to address longtermist threats like the dangers posed by artificial intelligence spiraling out of control. As he put it, funding for the eradication of tropical diseases should come from other people who actually cared about tropical diseases: “Like, not me or something.” (It looks increasingly unlikely that the nonprofits he started will be able to honor their financial commitments to his favored causes.)"

The company’s network also has a reputation for being faster and more reliable than the networks available to owners of electric vehicles made by other manufacturers. Those chargers require drivers to download special apps and often are hard to use or out of commission.

Tesla accounts for more than half the fast chargers in the United States, and its network could provide a significant boost to the Biden administration’s plans to encourage electric vehicle ownership and fight climate change. Financial incentives to car buyers and manufacturers, part of the Inflation Reduction Act passed by Democrats in Congress last year, are already making some electric vehicles as cheap to buy as comparable gasoline cars.

The Biden administration said 7,500 Tesla chargers will be open to other vehicles by the end of 2024. Of those, 3,500 are fast chargers capable of recharging a vehicle in about half an hour to an hour.

As of 2021, that program included about 43,000 controllable thermostats that help make a small dent in peak demand. Because of its success, the city’s municipal utility expanded the program on June 1 with an ongoing $25 annual credit for each thermostat that remains enrolled in the program.

That’s a nice start, but there are about 400,000 households in Austin. This program should be scaled up and we should be paid much more for the benefits we provide on very hot afternoons. And participating is no great hardship. You can run your air-conditioners in the morning — when there is plenty of power available — to get your home nice and cool. When they’re switched off in the afternoon, you’re still comfortable.

Utilities have a lot to gain from these programs, including more control over the grid and avoiding the costs and many years involved with building new power plants. And we all benefit from the emissions and fuel costs we avoid by not having to fire up backup power plants in a heat wave. But so far, participation in the United States has been largely voluntary and limited.

For demand-response systems to tap their full potential, smart controls would need to be installed in every home. That means new building codes that require “energy optimized” homes. Though the idea would be for everyone to participate, it should of course be possible to opt out if someone in the household requires a steady temperature for health or other reasons.

So, why aren’t we already doing it on a large scale? We have designed our system to ramp power plants up and down to deal with peak demand. But we need to flip our thinking — we need to adjust demand to the capacity of the power plants. And we need to develop a system that pays homeowners and renters appropriately. With the right combination of technologies and policies, we can get there quickly and breathe a little more easily the next time a heat wave comes around."

A self-professed “free speech absolutist,” Mr. Musk has said that he wants Twitter to be a town square where all ideas, no matter how unpopular, may be expressed. He has also been cooperative with Walter Isaacson, who has written biographies of Steve Jobs, Leonardo da Vinci and Albert Einstein and is now working on a book about Mr. Musk. “He’s been very, very open,” Mr. Isaacson told The Times last year, “not only him and the people around him, but he’s been very good at allowing me access to people from his past.”

At the same time, Mr. Musk has tangled publicly with journalists who have seemingly gotten under his skin. In December, Twitter suspended the accounts of eight journalists, including Ryan Mac, a tech reporter for The Times. Those suspensions came a day after Mr. Musk pulled the plug on more than 25 accounts that tracked the planes of government agencies, billionaires and celebrities.

Some of the journalists barred by Twitter had reported on the accounts that tracked flight data or had chronicled Mr. Musk’s stewardship of the company in detail. “You’re not special because you’re a journalist; you’re a citizen, so no special treatment,” Mr. Musk told reporters during a Twitter audio session shortly after the accounts were deactivated. Following criticism from First Amendment advocates and threats of sanctions from European regulators, Twitter reinstated the journalists’ accounts.

One reporter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because his employer would not permit him to discuss Mr. Musk publicly, compared writing about Twitter to covering a White House in which the person in charge is both press-obsessed and chaotic, leading to debates on whether his airing of grievances about the news media is part of his genius or a manifestation of his childishness.

Mr. Musk has enlisted communications consultants at times. But his history of capriciousness and saying incendiary things (often by tweet) has sometimes created challenges for the advisers brought in to manage those impulses.

In 2018, Mr. Musk lobbed an insult at one of his critics, calling him a “pedo guy,” or pedophile, in a series of angry tweets. Amid substantial fallout, he turned to the communications consultant Juleanna Glover, whose clients have included John McCain and James Murdoch and who had advised Mr. Musk’s electric car company, Tesla. Mr. Musk ultimately apologized for the tweets."

The breakthrough is a huge step toward a long-held dream, one that has captured the world’s collective imagination: The ability to mimic the way the sun generates the energy that sustains life on Earth, and to control that process for the good of humankind. The achievement, at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, “will go down in the history books,” said Energy Secretary Jennifer M. Granholm at a news conference Tuesday.

It was hailed as a milestone on the path toward a future of nearly limitless, emissions-free power, though there is still a question of when, and whether, fusion can become available on a widespread, practical scale.

It has wind speeds of 130 miles an hour and is expected to make landfall around 8 a.m Eastern, bringing catastrophic waves and potentially submerging the coast in up to 16 feet of flooding. You can track the storm’s path here.

The strongest part of the storm will be over Florida’s Big Bend, where the state’s long peninsula curves to meet its Panhandle. Though that region is sparsely populated, the storm is expected to affect much of the southeastern United States: Officials issued evacuation orders in counties across West and Central Florida, and governors in Georgia and the Carolinas declared states of emergency because of concerns about heavy rains and potential tornadoes.

More than half of Florida’s western coastline is at risk of life-threatening storm surges, as rising ocean water floods towns. “You’re not going to be able to survive that,” Gov. Ron DeSantis warned. Here are the latest updates:

More than 50,000 customers in Florida are already without power. Tallahassee is preparing for outages that could last days, expecting its strongest storm in decades.

Heavy rains doused Tampa , Florida’s third-largest city, overnight. Much of the city closed in preparation. See what has shut down.

Schools canceled classes, performers postponed concerts and museums closed across the Southeast , too.

Children in the Naples, Fla. , area huddled in hallways yesterday during a tornado warning.

The Florida National Guard is fully mobilized, with more than 55,000 soldiers and airmen either deployed or deploying, and help is coming from as far away as California.

Communities along hundreds of miles of coastline boarded up windows, sandbagged buildings and emptied grocery store shelves of water. Many people have fled Cedar Key, an island city that is home to roughly 700 people. “My family has been here for many generations,” said the mayor, Heath Davis. “We haven’t seen a storm this bad, ever.”

Hot water, stronger hurricanes

Idalia (pronounced ee-DAL-ya) is the first major hurricane to threaten the U.S. mainland this Atlantic season, which is expected to be more active than usual. That’s partly because of human-driven climate change, which appears to have contributed to record-breaking ocean temperatures off the Florida coast."

U.S.-Chinese relations have recently been pushed to their weakest point in years. Tensions have flared over the flight of a Chinese surveillance balloon over the United States, tougher restrictions on technology from Washington, Beijing’s partnership with Moscow during the war in Ukraine and China’s continued threatening of Taiwan.

In recent months, the Biden administration has been working to halt a further decline in the relationship, which it sees as a potential threat to global peace and stability. In addition to Ms. Yellen, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken visited Beijing last month and John Kerry, President Biden’s special envoy for climate change, is heading there on Sunday.

But new investment restrictions from the United States could escalate the tit-for-tat measures that the two countries have been deploying just as they are trying to set a “floor” under their relationship.

The new measures seem to have been largely settled for many months now. But the Biden administration appears to have delayed announcing them given the tumultuous relationship with China. Some of the details also continue to be debated by U.S. government agencies. Once the restrictions are proposed, the private sector will have time to comment on the limits, which could shape how they are put in place."

The regulations will surely face legal challenges from those who see them as government overreach. Some automakers fear that the administration’s push for electric vehicles could result in job losses and lower profits. Nearly all major car companies have already spent billions switching to electric, but the new rules would require them to shift their production processes in ways that would essentially spell the end of new gas vehicles.

Today, at the alliance’s summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, all 31 NATO leaders agreed to offer an invitation. Yet Zelensky was left disappointed.

Without offering any timeline, NATO said it would allow Ukraine to join only “when allies agree and conditions are met.” The move would be a major blow to President Vladimir Putin — bringing the Western alliance to his doorstep — but it could be a very long time before Ukraine is allowed to join.

Zelensky called NATO’s lack of specifics “absurd,” but did soften his tone when he arrived at the summit.

The main reason for denying Ukraine membership is because of the ongoing war with Russia. “NATO’s collective defense promise, the famous Article V, would mean that every NATO member is obligated to fight for Ukraine,” my colleague Steven Erlanger said. “And nobody wants to do that.”"

Historically, Japan spent only about 1 percent of its economic output on the military — a legacy of its post-World War II desire to avoid belligerence, as was also the case for Germany. But starting in 2012, Shinzo Abe, then the prime minister, began pushing for a new approach, one that he argued was more fitting for modern realities.

Initially, the Japanese public was skeptical. In 2015, people took to the streets to protest a law that allowed Japanese troops to participate in some combat missions, notes Motoko Rich, The Times’s Tokyo bureau chief.

Today, people seem more supportive. Japan’s current prime minister, Fumio Kishida, plans to raise defense spending gradually to 2 percent of economic output, and the public reaction has been “remarkably sanguine,” Motoko says. The new aggressiveness of China and nuclear tests by North Korea help explain the shift.

There are trade-offs, of course. The additional money that countries spend on defense is money they cannot spend on roads, child care, cancer research, refugee resettlement, public parks or clean energy, my colleague Patricia points out. One reason Macron has insisted on raising France’s retirement age despite widespread protests, analysts believe, is a need to leave more money for the military.

But the situation over the past few decades feels unsustainable. Some of the world’s richest countries were able to spend so much on social programs partly because another country — the U.S. — was paying for their defense. Those other countries, sensing a more threatening world, are now once again promising to pull their weight. They still need to demonstrate that they’ll follow through this time."

“I have joined the growing numbers of Arizonans who reject party politics by declaring my independence from the broken partisan system in Washington,” she wrote in an opinion column published in The Arizona Republic.

Ms. Sinema’s decision put an abrupt damper on the jubilance Democrats experienced this week after their caucus secured a 51st seat in the Senate with Senator Raphael Warnock’s victory in Georgia. It was likely to provide new complications for Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Democrats going forward, even though she wrote in her column that “becoming an independent won’t change my work in the Senate; my service to Arizona remains the same.”

Still the move by the first-term senator, who was facing a likely Democratic re-election challenge in 2024 after angering her party by opposing key elements of its agenda, was unlikely to change the day-to-day reality in Washington for Democrats, who have long had to contend with her unpredictability and diversions from the party line.

The invitation wasn’t simply a politician’s attempt to associate himself with a celebrity. It also came with a political message. Cantor was one of the founders of a new Hollywood labor union, the Screen Actors Guild, along with James Cagney, Miriam Hopkins, Groucho Marx, Spencer Tracy and others. The previous month, the union’s members had elected Cantor as their president.

The Guild’s formation was part of a surge in union membership in the 1930s. During Roosevelt’s early flurry of legislation, he signed an economic recovery bill that included a provision giving workers a clearer right to join labor unions than they had previously had. Americans responded by signing up for unions by the thousands.

Cantor was a symbol of this right. Hollywood stars were obviously not typical workers, but they were famous. By inviting Cantor to join him for Thanksgiving, Roosevelt reminded Americans of the central role that labor unions played in a healthy capitalist economy. The president was subtly encouraging other workers to consider joining a union at their own workplace."

Europe’s energy crisis has stabilized for now, but uncertainty over the continent’s power supply could linger for years. High inflation has added to the pressure for leaders to diversify energy sources.

The response of some European countries to the crisis has complicated their positions at this year’s U.N. climate summit, currently underway in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. European countries outspent rivals to stockpile gas ahead of winter this year, seeking out new supplies from the United States to Africa, and pricing many poorer countries out of the market.

But the European Union’s long-term policy commitments have doubled down on renewables since the start of the war — at least on paper. Analysts suggest the shocks from the Ukraine war seem likely to accelerate, not slow, Europe’s transition to clean energy.

Making that transition economically and sustainably will require balancing the role of each energy source on Europe's path to reaching net zero carbon emissions.

Gas: Stabilized, for Now

Gas power remained stable across much of Europe, but it took a major effort and billions of euros to secure alternatives to Russian gas.

As percent of total generation mix

For decades, Europe grew heavily dependent on Russian gas. The low prices were tempting. So was the idea that, as the “cleanest of the fossil fuels,” gas gave progressive leaders an off-ramp from dirtier coal. By last year, the European Union depended on Russia for 40 percent of its total gas consumption.

Russia started to throttle its gas supply to Europe, and after invading Ukraine, the country cut gas flows further in retaliation against European sanctions. Pipelines connecting the regions, the Nord Stream 1 and 2, were sabotaged by a series of explosions in September.

To fill the gap, Europe had to go searching for new sources and found it primarily in liquefied natural gas from the United States, where production is expected to hit a record high this year. LNG is about 600 times more compact than its gaseous form and can be moved anywhere in the world through specialized ships and ports.

That portability meant that Europe had to compete for LNG against many different bidders.

Europe had no option but to pay up. Beyond its use in generating electricity, many homes are still heated with gas, and some industries depend on it both as a power source for factories and as a raw material. Businesses across Europe were among the hardest-hit, with manufacturers pausing or shutting down factories over sharply rising costs.

Since the start of the war, Europe has also used more coal. Power generation from coal has increased more than 12 percent compared with the same period last year.

Europeans and key industries also lowered their energy use since the start of the war. A mild start to winter has also lessened gas demand at the same time Europe has filled their reserves, helping to alleviate the gas crunch ahead of winter.

Nuclear: At Historic Lows

Nuclear power struggled this year, especially in France, a major producer.

As percent of total generation mix

France was supposed to be insulated from fossil fuel price shocks, like the Russian gas cuts, thanks to its large fleet of domestic nuclear power plants. Typically, more than 70 percent of its power generation comes from nuclear, and the country is a net-exporter of electricity.

But currently half of France’s aging nuclear reactors remain offline for repairs and scheduled maintenance that had been delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic, which plagued the fleet all year. An extreme summer heat wave put added stress on the system by limiting power plants’ cooling capacity. Labor strikes further exacerbated the nuclear energy crunch.

Nuclear power plants are also expensive to build and run. France’s state-backed nuclear energy operator is nearly €45 billion in debt and will become fully nationalized to ensure a steady energy supply.

While nuclear power can be safe and stable under most circumstances, it has long been controversial among environmental activists because it carries other risks.

In Germany, nuclear power generation has been declining for years. While nuclear power used to supply over a quarter of the country’s energy in the early 2000s, Germany’s anti-nuclear movement exerted political pressure to close its reactors following the nuclear meltdown in Fukushima, Japan.

Though Germany was set to close its three remaining nuclear reactors this year, Chancellor Olaf Scholz ordered an extension to their operation until spring next year, in light of the current crisis.

Hydro: Strained by Heat and Drought

Unprecedented heat and drought spurred on by climate change and three straight years of La Niña also became a major setback for hydroelectric power. Rivers in southern Europe reached record lows.

As percent of total generation mix

The lack of hydro and nuclear power was a real problem amid the gas crisis, said Carlos Torres Diaz, head of power markets research at Rystad Energy, an independent energy consultancy. “If these two sources were at the normal level, then Europe probably would not have needed so much gas.”

Europe is warming around twice as fast as the rest of the world. The glaciers that help store and release meltwater are diminishing quickly, and hot, dry summers like this year’s could become more common.

A study last year found that global warming would lead to decreased annual stream flows in Southern Europe by the end of the century, affecting hydroelectric power, but suggested Northern Europe would see increased flows.

In 2017, wind surpassed hydroelectricity as the largest renewable source of power for the European Union.

Solar and Wind: Rising

A record year for solar and wind power saved the European Union €11 billion in gas costs this year, generating around a quarter of total electricity since the war began. It still wasn’t enough to offset the losses from nuclear and hydropower this year, or curb consumption of fossil fuels.

Some critics, including the C.E.O. of Exxon Mobil, have blamed the current energy crisis at least partly on the transition to renewables, arguing that European countries have underinvested in fossil fuels. But other energy experts argued that Europe has not transitioned to renewables quickly enough, noting that more domestically produced wind and solar power could have blunted the effects of Russia’s gas cuts.

“People who point their finger at renewables as the source of the problem — that’s really exactly the wrong direction,” said Lion Hirth, a professor of energy policy at the Hertie School in Berlin. “The problem is that we have too little renewables, and built too little and too slowly over the past 10 years, not too much and too fast.”

In May, the European Commission put out a plan for achieving energy independence from Russia that leaned further into the renewable energy transition. Known as REPowerEU, it encourages diversifying fossil fuel sources and accelerating the adoption of renewable energy sources like wind and solar, and also pushes for greater energy savings.

The plan would also help Europe move closer to reaching its ambitious climate goals.

But major challenges remain. Solar power, in particular, has supply chain risks of its own. China has a near-monopoly on the raw materials and technical expertise to produce photovoltaic cells for solar panels. An analysis from Bloomberg BNEF found it would take nearly $150 billion for Europe to build the plants to manufacture enough solar capacity and storage to meet demand by 2030.

Achieving energy security and meeting climate goals will take far greater investment and cooperation between European countries than ever before, according to energy experts.

“One of Europe’s founding fathers — Jean Monnet — used to say that Europe would be made out of crisis,” said Simone Tagliapietra, a senior fellow at Bruegel, an energy think tank. “Europe will come out of this energy crisis more united when it comes to energy and climate policy.”"

How would placing a price tag on nature help?

Take carbon pricing. If you can put a value on a ton of carbon dioxide, which we can do now, then why wouldn’t it be feasible to pay countries to not drill for oil or cut their trees, to protect resources instead of exploiting them?

Poor countries that have abundant natural resources are loaning their economic resources, like the carbon-sequestering value of their rainforests, to rich countries without compensation. Last year at COP [the U.N. climate conference], [Special Presidential Envoy for Climate] John Kerry practically begged the Democratic Republic of the Congo not to drill for oil in rainforest and peat lands, which would release lots of carbon, and the retort was “pay us.” It’s not a bad answer, actually.

Are there examples of successful projects for preserving natural resources?

The Forest Resilience Bond is the brainchild of four Berkeley graduate students. What they did was look at standing forests in the Lake Tahoe area as infrastructure. And they raised funds to maintain the forest — like you would for an infrastructure project — from the beneficiaries of the environment, such as the local wildlife service, the tourism industry, insurers and even hydropower companies that rely on standing forest to replenish groundwater. That kind of bond could be done all around the world.

Why add such a pricing structure when economies can exploit nature for free?

We are facing real costs now. Nature is the thing underpinning our economies and it is a depreciating asset. We speculate about price all the time when it comes to company valuations. Yet the atmosphere is worth nothing. We need a new kind of thinking."

Odell, 36, is an artist by training who taught digital art at Stanford for eight years. Her work often has an environmental focus; in one art show, she displayed refuse from the trash, sometimes pairing them with images of those same objects when they were new, along with research on where they were made. The idea was to encourage people to think about the entire life cycle of an object, she said, not just our short relationship with it. A CD player, for example, which was muddy and crushed and looked “like it had been run over by a truck,” she said, was juxtaposed with an advertisement for it in pristine condition, and information on its manufacture. She has been an artist in residence at a recycling center in San Francisco and at the San Francisco Planning Department.

“My whole vibe,” she said, “is artist in residence at weird places.”

What unites her work is an appetite for research and an attention to detail. As a small child, she said, she once played a carnival game where the goal was to guess which foil boat had an X on the bottom. Winners received a ticket to a water theme park.

But when you’re analyzing the effects of a technological shock, it’s also useful to analyze the society that existed just as the shock arrived. On the internet “we could have built any kind of world,” Thompson writes. “We built this one. Why have we done this to ourselves?” One answer is that social media entered into a world that was experiencing the triumph of a certain kind of social liberalism, which the new tech subjected to a stress test that it has conspicuously failed.

By “social liberalism” I don’t mean the progressivism that took off in the Trump era — antiracism and diversity-equity-inclusion and #MeToo. I mean the more individualistic liberalism that emerged in the 1960s and experienced a second takeoff across the first decade of the 2000s. Its defining features were rapid secularization (the decline of Christian identification accelerated from the 1990s onward) and increasing social and sexual permissiveness — extending beyond support for same-sex marriage to beliefs about premarital sex, divorce, out-of-wedlock childbearing, marijuana use and more.

In the early Obama years, many liberals assumed that these trends were positive and healthy, or at least sustainable and manageable. They weren’t yielding the social disorder that conservatives always fear, crime was low and the decline of the two-parent family could be treated mostly as an economic problem, and blue America (or at least upper-middle-class blue America) seemed to be successfully balancing moral liberty and personal responsibility.

But then the smartphone revolution asked people raised under these conditions — raised with less family stability and weak attachments to religion, with a strong emphasis on self-creation and a strong hostility to “normativity” — to enter and forge a new social world. And they went forth and created the online world we know today, with its pinball motion between extremes of toxic narcissism and the solidarity of the mob, its therapy-speak unmoored from real community, its conspiracism and ideological crazes, its mimetic misery and despairing catastrophism."

Under Mr. Döpfner, Axel Springer has expanded from a traditional German publisher to an international digital media company. In 2015, the company bought Business Insider (now called Insider) for $442 million. It purchased Politico in 2021 for more than $1 billion, with the aim of becoming what Mr. Döpfner described as “the leading digital publisher in the democratic world.”

The New York private equity company KKR owns a 35.6 percent stake it bought in 2019 to take the company private, allowing Axel Springer to expand more rapidly outside Germany and focus its energy on pushing into digital media. Axel Springer announced last month that it would begin phasing out its printed newspapers in the next years.

Mering’s music often revels in the plurality of its perspective; we is just as common a pronoun as me. Every so often, this imperative to speak big-tent truths can become strained and make her lyrics frustratingly vague, as on “Children of the Empire” (“we tend to live long, that’s why so many things go wrong”), but that song’s gorgeous vocal melody and Mering’s impassioned performance lift it beyond its limitations. (“Hearts Aglow” certainly contains some of the best and most soulful singing on any of Mering’s records.) Even Mering’s most on-the-nose “pandemic song,” “The Worst Is Done,” is most vivid when she’s singing about her individual experience: “I should’ve stayed with my family,” she sings, “I shouldn’t have stayed in my little place in the world’s loneliest city.”

That grounding in personal experience, though, is what elevates a song like “Grapevine” or the more abstract “God Turn Me Into a Flower,” a minimalist, synth-driven meditation that becomes almost liturgical in its emotional power. “It’s good to be soft when they push you down,” Mering sings, clarion-like. Lyrically, it’s the album’s most singular and inward-focused song, but it is also a plea to transcend self-consciousness and become one with nature. In the end, Mering gets her wish: For the last minute, her voice falls away and a chorus of chirping birds and whirring insects take over the vocal duties. However temporarily, she’s become a more modern kind of flower child, sunk blissfully into the fecund earth that — at least for now — hasn’t yet been scorched beyond repair.

The diplomats, meeting behind closed doors, discussed the war and which countries had the right equipment to send Ukraine for air defense, the official said.

The Group of 7 issued a broad statement on Friday that declared positions on a wide range of issues — from Russia and the Ukraine war to China to Iran — and highlighted their agreement to protect Ukrainian infrastructure.

I spoke to Adam about his article and the museum’s future. Here’s our conversation, lightly edited for clarity:

Tell me more about the Tar Pits’ rebranding effort.

The climate scientists and paleoecologists at the La Brea Tar Pits told me that what we’re experiencing right now is part of a long-term trend. The issue of drought, rising temperatures and fire — it’s not the first time that Southern California has experienced this. In fact, about 13,000 years ago, this landscape also experienced those three elements together. And that may have been the cause for the great extinction of the ice age mammals: mastodons, mammoths, dire wolves, saber-toothed cats. They all died in that period, and scientists for decades have been trying to figure out why.

It seems like connecting previous calamities to today’s climate is a pretty bleak way to try to get people to come to a museum on their day off.

The hope is that it can still be a place where the community gathers. But it can also be a more robust institution — it can show you the science. There’s talk of making it more interactive, making it come more alive. The hope is that this new narrative can show you the excavation process and reframe the way we look at climate so we see that these changes aren’t just trapped in time. They’re happening now. And, hopefully, this can influence the next generation of young scientists to take an interest in climate — it’s not just something happening on a mountaintop in the Himalayas with glaciers receding. This is happening all around us.

The Tar Pits are an actual scientific laboratory. What are some of the things we still have to learn about this time period? And what was Los Angeles like at the time?"

Our subjects ranged in age from 13 to 88 and represented a variety of genders, sexual orientations, ethnic backgrounds and professions. They came from Kokkola as well as the capital, Helsinki; Turku, a city on the southwestern coast; and three villages in southern, eastern and western Finland. While people praised Finland’s strong social safety net and spoke glowingly of the psychological benefits of nature and the personal joys of sports or music, they also talked about guilt, anxiety and loneliness. Rather than “happy,” they were more likely to characterize Finns as “quite gloomy,” “a little moody” or not given to unnecessary smiling. Many also shared concerns about threats to their way of life, including possible gains by a far-right party in the country’s elections, the war in Ukraine and a tense relationship with Russia, which could worsen now that Finland is set to join NATO. It turns out even the happiest people in the world aren’t that happy. But they are something more like content. Finns derive satisfaction from leading sustainable lives and perceive financial success as being able to identify and meet basic needs, Arto O. Salonen, a professor at the University of Eastern Finland who has researched well-being in Finnish society, explained. “In other words,” he wrote in an email, “when you know what is enough, you are happy.”"

They include answers like the social safety net, access to nature, music, badminton and the freedom to pursue the kind of life Finns want. The stories also mention concerns that could threaten that way of life, such as climate change, cuts to funding for the arts and anti-immigrant attitudes. What are the things that would make for a happy life for you? What things might affect your ability to have that kind of life?

Some Finns say the pressure to live up to their reputation as the happiest people on Earth can be too much. “Being sad or being not content with our life would be seen as ungrateful,” said Clara Paasimaki, a teenager. Do you ever feel this way? Do you think society puts too much emphasis on being happy?

Do you think there’s a connection between Finnish happiness and “sisu,” the expectation that Finns endure difficulty without complaint? Do you complain? Do you think negative talk ever inhibits you from feeling joy?

What do you think has the biggest impact on your ability to feel content? Is it having your basic needs met? Is it having everything you’ve ever wanted? Is it the quality of your relationships? Is it a certain mind-set or attitude? Or is it something else? If you had to sum up the secret to happiness in one sentence, what would it be?

702,A new World Bank report warns of a global slowdown of economic growth.

The production function gauges how much an economy can produce by measuring its labor force and capital stock as well as by estimating its rate of technological progress. The report acknowledges that this involves “assumptions that may be viewed as restrictive.” For other perspectives, World Bank researchers consulted outside forecasters’ estimates of long-term growth and did statistical tests on output over time to strip out fluctuations caused by business cycles.

Kose told me that much of the initial coverage of the report focused, understandably, on the World Bank’s warning that this “could be a lost decade in the making — not just for some countries or regions as has occurred in the past, but for the whole world.” The report says the sustainable growth ceiling, or “speed limit,” for many countries has fallen because of slowing productivity, sluggish or no growth in the labor force and “reversals in human capital triggered by the health shock, school closures and learning losses.”

But there’s hope, Kose insisted. Social problems have social solutions. The most important solution, he said, is to increase investment — not only in buildings, machines and software but also in people, through spending on education and health. Some people worry that economic growth is damaging the planet, but the report makes the case that investment in clean technology will help stem climate change while creating jobs and raising living standards.

Governments can’t count entirely on official development aid, Kose said. Most of the extra investment that’s needed will have to come from the private sector, he said. But, he added, “It takes two to tango.” Countries will need to make themselves more inviting to investors by fixing their macroeconomic situations, repairing infrastructure, removing red tape, strengthening institutions and legal systems and upgrading the education and health of their workforces, he said. The Middle East, Africa and South Asia can make “huge strides” by increasing women’s participation in the labor force, he added."

In this evening-length work, performed by the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Company at New York Live Arts in its New York premiere, much of the audience sits on the stage. The seating arrangement is a reminder, perhaps, that not only are we part of this performance world, but part of the larger world as well.

The dancers, who initially take seats among the crowd, soon make their way to the darkened stage, holding their smartphones, flashlights on; it’s as if their curving arms are embracing a partner. Marie Lloyd Paspe begins to sing in a clear, radiant voice: “Streets full of people, all alone; roads full of houses, never home.”

Given the visual — a stage dotted with flickering stars of light — her song is poignant: “Everyone’s Gone to the Moon,” by Jonathan King. The dancers, arms outstretched, spin like planets, and as with so much of the movement in “Curriculum II,” there is a directness, a simplicity that gives it power. The choreography, a mix of new and old dance phrases, is culled from the Jones/Zane archives."

Face it, folks. Earth is finished. It’s overheated, overcrowded, overregulated. It’s the ultimate fixer-upper, a dump we inherited from our parents that we’d be cruel to pass on to our children. It’s time to pull up stakes. It’s time for Mars.

Or maybe not.

Lighting out for the solar system is an appealing fantasy, but “A City on Mars,” an exceptional new piece of popular science by the “Soonish” authors Kelly and Zach Weinersmith, suggests we shouldn’t be so quick to give up on Earth. Forceful, engaging and funny, it is an essential reality check for anyone who has ever looked for home in the night sky.

“A City on Mars” groups the arguments in favor of immediate colonization into two categories. The first is the high-minded idea that mankind must spread to other planets “before civilization crumbles,” as Elon Musk told Walter Isaacson. The second is the “hot tub argument: Going to space is worth it because it’s cool."

The death toll there stood at 30 as of Monday evening, according to the local police. The wreckage stemming from the deluge forced the authorities there to shut down schools and advise residents to leave their homes only if necessary. Dozens more have been killed in the state since the monsoon season began in June.

Torrential rain continued to lash many states on Monday afternoon, including the capital region of Delhi, where roads in several areas were submerged in knee-deep water and court hearings had to be suspended or shifted online, away from flooded courthouses. The officials ordered evacuations in some areas because of flooding.

Australia is fast heading into our worst fire season since the summer of 2019-2020, or Black Summer, when nearly 500 people died, either through direct deaths or smoke inhalation. All-too-familiar images of horrific blazes and blood-red skies are already starting to fill the news. This week, dozens of homes were destroyed and hundreds of people have been evacuated as firefighters battle a wildfire in the Tara region in Queensland. Two people died in two separate fires in New South Wales earlier this month, one of them a firefighter who suffered a medical emergency while on the job.

We are better prepared this year, officials have said. More firefighting aircraft are available, and our national emergency coordination has been streamlined. And experts broadly do not expect this summer to be as bad as four years ago as it is being preceded by several years of rain and floods rather than drought.

Still, it’s an unsettling feeling, watching the news and waiting for the worst.

In the heart of Sydney, far away from any landscapes that could burn, I’ve been looking into getting an air purifier for my parents, who have respiratory problems. I’ve overheard conversations from residents contemplating leaving the country for a month or two, fearing another summer of smoke and smog.

Of course, that’s something that many residents in bushfire-prone areas don’t have the luxury of considering. Many are still rebuilding their lives and homes after Black Summer, have spent the past four years trying to fireproof their communities, and have become de facto experts in fire-related topics as diverse as vegetation and weather maps. And for some, danger and destruction have already arrived."

But a recent string of messages about gay and transgender rights, culminating in a video Mr. Emanuel released on Twitter earlier this month, has drawn considerable ire among conservatives in Japan. Critics say the ambassador has overstepped the bounds of diplomacy and crossed into unwanted interference in domestic policy.

As Japanese lawmakers debated a contentious bill declaring that there “should be no unfair discrimination” against the gay and transgender community, Mr. Emanuel marshaled a group of 15 foreign ambassadors in Tokyo to record a four-minute video nudging Japan to embrace L.G.B.T.Q. rights and, by implication, same-sex marriage.

Journalists sped between shows, packing in as many performances as possible.

And dance lovers, with a notably younger-skewed demographic, filled theaters all over the city.

Since its inception in 1984, the Biennial has espoused a democratic, participatory approach. Each edition opens with a huge parade, which this year involved 3,500 participants and was watched by a crowd of 150,000 people.

But this edition, led by a new director, Tiago Guedes, seemed even more focused on outreach, diversity and participation. “It’s important to open the doors over these three weeks,” Guedes said over a coffee last week. “To break the idea that dance is an elitist discipline.”"

But travel insurance is complicated with a range of benefits, inclusions and prices. Here’s what you need to know before you buy.

Know what’s covered

Generally speaking, travel insurance covers unforeseen events, like an illness in the family, the loss of a job or a natural disaster, that force you to cancel or interrupt a trip. It can also apply in the event of a strike at a transportation company, a terrorist attack in your destination or when your travel provider goes bankrupt. These are known as covered reasons. Most polices also include medical coverage, which is useful abroad where your health insurance may not cover you.

While policy prices vary based on age, length of travel and type of coverage, expect to pay between 4 to 10 percent of your entire trip cost to get insured.

That’s not because they think he’s done a bad job in office. Democrats tend to like President Biden and continue to give him good marks on handling the economy and foreign policy.

But many Democrats, particularly younger ones, are worried that he will simply be too old to be effective in a second term, which would end when he is 86. “My problem with him running in 2024 is that he’s just so old,” one Democrat told pollsters.

That may be deeply unfair — people age at different rates — and in Mr. Biden’s case, it’s impossible to deny that politics and conspiracy theories, rather than facts, fuel at least some of the concern. But candidates shouldn’t pretend, as Mr. Biden often does, that advanced age isn’t an issue. Mr. Biden is 80 now, the oldest American to serve as president, and even supporters, including the political strategist David Axelrod, have expressed deep worries that his age will be both a political liability in 2024 and a barrier to a successful second term. If Mr. Biden runs again, as he recently said he intends to, questions will persist about his age until he does more to assure voters that he is up to the job.

Mr. Biden’s age makes him an outlier even in an era when the nation’s political leadership is getting older. The current Senate, where the average age is 63.9 years, is the second oldest since 1789. The House, where the average age is 57.5 years, is the third oldest. By comparison, the average age in the United States is 38.8 years."

Bats send sonar signals, which bounce off objects and allow the mammals to navigate. “So we do that, we send out our signals, and it bounces off something that is true, something that is real, like family. The two parents who brought me into this world, my mother and father. The two children who I brought into this world,” he went on. “That is real. That is true. That means something to me.”

In person, his presentation is a lot more intense; it is also about a bleaker landscape of American life than the bright version of Trumpism he’s trying to project.

“We’re hungry for a cause,” Mr. Ramaswamy, who is 37, said of millennials when he spoke on a recent Friday night in Iowa, in a navy suit and white dress shirt, walking the stage and not pausing too often for applause. “We’re hungry for purpose and meaning. And identity. At a point in our national history when the things that used to fill that void — things like faith, patriotism, hard work, family — these things have disappeared.” Instead, he said, “poison” and “secular cults” had taken their place."

Early adopters of the new orthodoxies bought bulky, high-powered Wolf ranges, crafted in stainless steel, from restaurant suppliers, until the company, recognizing an evolving luxury market, introduced a residential version that would go on to spend the next decades as shorthand for a moneyed cosmopolitan domesticity.

Even if you were never going to acquire a $10,000 six-burner range with intense heat and flame capacity, the modern ethos around food and design insisted on gas, raining down condescension on the coiled cooking surface in all of its functional and aesthetic impoverishment, its opposition to delivering, you might learn, a perfectly seared scallop from the Bay of Fundy. How would an electric stove appear in a Nancy Meyers movie other than as a sacrilege along the order of linoleum at Versailles?

Anyone who had the vision to imagine that kitchen mechanicals would eventually have a place in the culture wars could probably not have foreseen where the politics were going to align — with the populist right embracing the gas range as a protected-class-victim appliance, even though federal data confirms what we might suspect.

The temporary way is that some people stayed away from New Orleans because they were sick with Covid or were worried about catching it.

The possibly permanent change is that during the two years the conference wasn’t held live, one of its important functions fell away. It used to be that about 1,500 Ph.D. candidates would attend to look for jobs and about 2,000 professors would come to interview them, in hotel suites. Now those initial interviews are happening online by video, and no one seems interested in going back to the old way, which was inconvenient for all and uncomfortable for many female candidates. (Another depressant this year is that some economists stayed away in protest of Louisiana’s abortion ban, which was triggered by the overturning of Roe v. Wade.)

The question people were asking one another in New Orleans is whether the event can survive without what for many was its reason for being: hiring.

Breadth and depth matter, the new president said. There are plenty of smaller, narrower economic conferences, but if you want to learn about topics outside your specialty or catch up with old colleagues who have gone in other directions, there’s nothing better than the annual A.S.S.A. meeting, said Athey, who is also chief economist of the antitrust division of the Department of Justice.

Daron Acemoglu, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told me he enjoyed this year’s meeting more than past ones because he was able to participate in more sessions instead of interviewing grad students all weekend. He said the current level of attendance might be more or less the new steady state.

Kline’s piece seems heartfelt — suspiciously so. This cinematic vision of Americans harmoniously disavowing a racist symbol has the dreamlike clarity of a pharmaceutical ad. It’s sappy, clean, resolved — a satire of progressive propaganda, goosing the libs.

Blunt sentiment, cushioned by an uncertain dose of parody, defines Kline’s career-spanning survey at the Whitney, down to its grand, neocon-inspired title: “Project for a New American Century.” The 43-year-old New Yorker flirts with the idioms of contemporary propaganda — ads, memes, influencers — just as the artist duo Vitaly Komar and Alexander Melamid tackled the posters, flags, and slogans of the Cold War.

Deliveries of fuel, coal, industrial chemicals and building materials were similarly delayed throughout the nation’s heartland.

This critical river and its tributaries — responsible for transporting more than $17 billion worth of farm products and 60 percent of all U.S. corn and soybean exports annually — has been stricken by drought since September, amid a time of global grain shortage and soaring food prices. While water levels will recover modestly this week, thanks to some upstream rain and snow, the long-term forecast remains dry.

Conditions are even worse in the southwestern United States, where an ongoing 22-year drought — now the harshest in 1,200 years — has shriveled Colorado River reservoirs, straining water supplies for farms, cities and hydropower from the Hoover Dam. Across the Atlantic in Germany, warmer temperatures and longer droughts have shrunk the Rhine River, making navigation harrowing on a waterway responsible for up to 80 percent of the country’s ship-bound cargo.

Economic powerhouse rivers like these are being sucked dry not only by climate change but by fast-growing cities and farming operations that need more water. Agriculture is the single largest consumer of freshwater, and global food demand is still rising."

The wild weather has come at a time when the demand for summer camp is up, three years after the start of the pandemic.

It started with the smoke drifting down from Canada, which prompted air quality alerts in the Midwest and Northeast as camp season was getting underway.

At Tanglewood Nature Center in Elmira, N.Y., which runs a day camp for children of elementary school age, the Air Quality Index hit 183 this month, an unhealthy level. The smoke forced the campers to stay indoors, where they built papier-mâché volcanoes. Wildfire smoke also meant more indoor activities for campers at Y.M.C.A.

The storm that wreaked havoc on Camp Squanto, which dumped up to eight inches of rain across much of the Northeast, also disrupted Camp Killooleet in Hancock, Vt.

Eleven U.S. banks came together yesterday to inject $30 billion into First Republic Bank, a smaller peer on the brink of collapse after the implosion of Silicon Valley Bank last week.

The arrangement was without precedent in decades, and an indication of how dire the banking sector’s predicament had become within a week. With their echoes of the 2008 financial crisis, the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank on Friday and Signature Bank on Sunday set off a panic that appears unlikely to subside immediately.

Shares of First Republic, which had lost three-quarters of their value in recent days, rallied on the announcement. But numerous other bank stocks continued to be pummeled. The banking sector has also been under pressure as a result of trouble at Credit Suisse, which was fighting for its life before Switzerland’s central bank stepped in to provide a backstop.

“Born and raised in Berkeley, I had a disdain for the Central Valley and Sacramento — hot and flat, they seemed to me — until I read this book. It opened my eyes (and my mind) to the depth of history, the richness of family and community, the importance of place, and the wonder that is all of California.” — Peg Cahill, Mt. Shasta

“Southern California: An Island on the Land” by Carey McWilliams (1970)

“Written in 1946, it is the fascinating story of how Southern California got well on the road to what it is today. It starts with geology and the all-important climate, but is filled with larger-than-life characters like Helen Hunt Jackson, Aimee Semple McPherson and the makers of Hollywood. This is a must-read for anyone who wants to understand the region and its hold on America.” — Dave Wilkinson, Moorpark

“Cadillac Desert” by Marc Reisner (1986)

“It’s a terrific mix of firsthand journalism, deep research and great storytelling, and it reveals just how precarious the West’s interdependent water supply is. Throw in political rivalries, underhanded deals, and the larger battle between the increasing demands of new arrivals and an overtaxed ecosystem, and you have a landmark work. It was written more than a generation ago, but its story of the conflict between land development and water policy in the American West remains one of the nation-shaping stories of today.” — James Daly, Alameda

“Properties of Thirst” by Marianne Wiggins (2022)

“Set mostly during World War II in central California, it is written in such marvelous prose. This sprawling masterpiece is filled with multigenerational coming-of-age stories and dives into the California water wars, as well as the birth (and shameful disgrace) of the Japanese internment camp at Manzanar. It shines a light on the cultural and class differences of that era. There is much about agriculture and the produce native to central California, and there is lots of cooking.” — Nancy Dolan, Oxnard

“City of Quartz: Excavating the Future in Los Angeles” by Mike Davis (1990)

“This incredible deconstruction and examination of the myth of the Golden West is a brilliant cultural geography of Los Angeles. From the ruins of Llano to the founding of the Church of Scientology, Davis illuminates the power structures that have controlled Los Angeles since its founding.” — Elizabeth Rood, San Francisco"

At this point, much is known about the myriad attempts Trump and his backers made to subvert the result of the 2020 presidential election. The country’s saving grace was that there was little preparation behind that effort and Republicans in key positions — to say nothing of Democrats — proved hostile to the project. But as The Times reported in October, more than 370 Republicans running for office in 2022 have said they doubt the results of that election, and “hundreds of these candidates are favored to win their races.”

The 2022 elections are very likely to sweep into power hundreds of Republicans committed to making sure that the 2024 presidential election goes their way, no matter how the vote tally turns out. Hardly anything has been done to fortify the system against chicanery since Jan. 6. What if congressional Republicans refuse to certify the results in key states, as a majority of House Republicans did in 2020? What if — when Trump calls Republican secretaries of state or governors or board of elections supervisors in 2024, demanding they find the votes he wishes he had or disqualify the votes his opponent does have — they try harder to comply? The possibilities for crisis abound.

Here, too, Republican officeholders who don’t fully buy into Trumpist conspiracy theories may find themselves rationalizing compliance. This is a movie we have already watched. Most of the House Republicans who voted against certification of the 2020 election knew Trump’s claims were absurd. But they chose to hide behind Representative Mike Johnson’s bizarre, evasive rationale for voting as Trump demanded they vote without needing to embrace the things he said. Johnson’s solution was to suggest that pandemic-era changes to voting procedures were unconstitutional, thus rendering the results uncertifiable. It was nonsense, and worse than that, it was cowardice. But it’s a reminder that the problem is not merely the Republican officeholders who would force an electoral crisis. The enabling threat is the much larger mass of their colleagues who have already proved they will do nothing to object.

Not all crises begin with a political showdown. Some could come from a virus mutating toward greater lethality. Some could come from a planet warming outside the narrow band that has fostered human civilization. Some could come from the expansionary ambitions of dictators and autocrats. The past few years have brought vivid examples of all three. But particularly over the past year, the Republican Party has shown itself to be somewhere between dismissive of and hostile toward the preparations and responses these possible crises demand.

Last week I criticized the Biden administration for failing to find a party-line path to financing pandemic preparedness. But such a path was necessary only because the Republican Party has swung so hard against efforts to prepare for the next pandemic. The Republican Study Committee’s budget is a vivid example of where the party has gone on Covid. It is not that Republicans are pro-Covid. But the party’s energy is very much anti-anti-Covid. It includes policy after policy attacking vaccine mandates, emergency powers and vaccinations for children. But in its 100-plus pages, I could find nothing proposing ways to make sure we are better prepared for the next viral threat."

While I may fret over the ambiguity on Page 5 of a student’s essay, I’m aware of the greater machine. Their whole semester will boil down to one letter, and that letter joins 30 or so others on a transcript they may send to a dozen colleges, some of which have thousands of applicants.

Besides, I like my students. I see them coming into the building at 7:30, carrying three backpacks for a routine that may well go on until 7:30 that night, roughly the time it takes someone to complete a full Ironman triathlon. They will use their free periods to prep for group projects, they’ll scarf down lunch before a French quiz, and hours later, toe the line of scrimmage against those massive defensive backs from the other side of the county. I don’t need to be excellent at as many utterly different things as they do. And my skills are not constantly judged like this, year after year, by a rotation of personalities. If kids come to my writing classes and share their heart and soul on the page, I want to offer them a handhold on this stony path.

Also, it’s just so much easier to give good grades!

But when so many adolescent egos rest upon this collective, timorous deflection, it doesn’t do an awful lot of good. Passing off the average as exceptional with bromides like “wonderful” and “impressive” soothes the soul, but if there’s nothing there to modify these adjectives, teachers do little service to their colleagues who receive these students the next year. It has that looming sense of climate denial, propped up by wishful thinking.

Grade inflation, after all, acts just like real inflation. In the early 1960s, when, according to GradeInflation.com, about 15 percent of grades given at four-year colleges were A’s, a dollar could buy you a movie ticket. Now, this will get you 15 seconds with a college essay coach and a firsthand lesson in Freud’s concept of the narcissism of minor differences: The more a community shares the same thing, the higher the sensitivity becomes about small disparities. So if everyone else applying to the College on the Hill has A’s in math, your A-minus suddenly gives you the wrong distinction.

In the shape-shifting landscape of college admissions, grades have never been more important. Now more than 80 percent of four-year colleges do not require standardized tests. Interviews, perhaps the truest show of the unadorned student, are also falling the way of the Bachman’s warbler. ChatGPT brings possibly serviceable responses to essay questions, if you can live with yourself for using it. And a recommendation letter coming from someone who teaches 150 students is going to look different from someone’s who teaches 50. This all augurs toward the new Pangea: grades. As a high school teacher, I don’t want to hold that much power, nor do I think I should."

It has been a long time, and a lot of money. Since I was inspired to become an astronaut by the Apollo moon missions, I would have loved a chance to go to the moon myself. But I have mixed feelings, though I hope that we have a successful mission. It is always exciting to see a new vehicle fly.

For perspective, we went from creating NASA to landing humans on the moon in just under 11 years. This program has, in one version or another, been ongoing since 2004. SpaceX, on the other hand, has made tremendous progress since starting not long before 2004. I would bet on SpaceX to land humans on the moon before NASA.

Stirone: David, you’ve shared how inspiring the Apollo mission was for you, but you’re having trouble getting excited for Artemis. How do you reconcile the longing for that inspiration with this program?

Grinspoon: I find myself so conflicted about this, and I’m trying to figure out why. Part of the problem is that it feels a bit like a do-over of Apollo. It’s not supposed to be: In theory it’s the beginning of a sustained presence on the moon, which is an exciting idea. But I have doubts about whether it is sustainable, given the costs and the politics. But also, it looks like a Saturn V, so there’s this strange sense of nostalgia mixed in, which I don’t trust. Yet, I know when it gets close to launch, when we’re counting down, I’ll get tears in my eyes and feel the thrill all over again.

Lori Garver: Like Leroy and David, I have very mixed feelings. I agree that sending humans to the moon again could offer meaningful benefits to the United States and society as a whole, but I don’t believe the way we are going about it is sustainable because we are using outdated and expensive single-use technologies. Apollo was a race, so doing it in that fashion was the right thing to do. We’ve now spent tens of billions of dollars and over a dozen years doing it again — just saying it is sustainable doesn’t make it so."

An Argentinean victory over France will not change the facts of economic globalization. The English Premier League alone usually turns over more money every season than the quadrennial World Cup, and European football towers over the rest of the world, which is why half of the players at the tournament play in just five big European leagues. Yet something will have changed, too.

It is now 16 years since a World Cup final was played in a football powerhouse European nation, as some of the rising powers of the Global South — South Africa, Brazil and now Qatar — have taken their turn. South Africa 2010 carried Pan-African aspirations that for a moment seemed to become reality, with Ghana poised to make a semifinal. Brazil 2014 was a celebration of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s Brazil, and by association the leftist governments that had transformed the continent, though it ended up as more of a wake.

Qatar 2022, by contrast, was always about Qatar — its visibility, its reputation and its strategic survival. Despite criticisms of the country’s treatment of migrant workers and disregard for L.G.B.T.Q. rights, it has achieved much of what was intended. After four weeks of near-constant football, and the sometimes bitter off-field conversations that accompanied it, Qatar’s position in the world is palpably stronger.

Yet as the first World Cup in an Arabic-speaking, Muslim-majority nation, it also aspired to stand for something more. In its timing, its crowds and its narratives, the tournament offered a version of the world in which the Global South, in all its myriad complexities, is more present and more powerful.

In FOUR BATTLEGROUNDS: Power in the Age of Artificial Intelligence (Norton, $32.50), Paul Scharre, a former soldier who is now the director of studies at the Center for a New American Security (a Washington think tank with which I was affiliated before his time there), foresees a world in which machines will be able to think not only faster, longer and more precisely in combat than humans, but also quite differently. For example, game-playing machines spook their human opponents because they make odd, unexpected and even “alien” moves, as if “from a different dimension.” When pilots operated in exercises against machine-controlled aircraft, they were surprised to find the planes flying directly at them, head-on — a maneuver human pilots don’t perform in training, for obvious reasons.

Scharre focuses on China, where the government is constructing what he terms “a new techno-dystopian state.” The test bed for this new system of omni-surveillance is the Xinjiang region. Government cameras and other devices register information on faces, fingerprints, eyes, voices, blood, DNA and license plates. Electronic police “sniffers” track Wi-Fi and cellphone usage. The border police have been known to install spyware on phones that automatically detects banned material, such as Muslim religious literature or photographs of the Dalai Lama. Artificial intelligence and huge amounts of computing power are required to help make sense of the ensuing flood of data.

With time, computing power will become even more important, Scharre predicts, playing the central role in the 21st century that oil did in the 20th. Thus, he says, new global powers will emerge — among them, he predicts, the Netherlands and Taiwan. The latter currently provides 90 percent of the high-end chips in the world; China, in comparison, is a “relative backwater.”

The Chinese government is investing heavily in an effort to catch up. Indeed, Scharre notes that over a quarter of the people studying artificial intelligence in the United States are Chinese citizens. Yet this gives the United States an unexpected advantage: These researchers “overwhelmingly” choose to remain here after graduation, he reports.

Scharre’s book brought to mind a phrase my editors used when I was a reporter decades ago at The Wall Street Journal: Certain articles, they said, were “dull but important.” Reading this book was not easy, but I think should be required for anyone interested in the future of the global economy or geopolitics."

They faced skeptical questioning from lawmakers about why their agencies — in particular the Fed, which was Silicon Valley Bank’s main regulator — had not done more to stop the bank from imploding. Democrats pressed the officials on whether gaps in regulation had allowed problems in the banking system to build after rollbacks under the Trump administration. Republicans, by contrast, blasted Fed supervisors for either missing obvious risks or not addressing them effectively.

It is unclear whether the intense scrutiny will spur any new laws or changes to existing ones, especially in a divided Congress. But the episode is likely to prompt regulatory and supervisory changes at the Fed. The central bank is conducting an investigation into how it failed to stop growing vulnerabilities at the bank. Mr. Barr suggested repeatedly on Tuesday that tighter regulation and supervision would most likely be the result of that inquiry, which is set to conclude by May 1."

Trump to the White House with hope or horror, the prospect of a Trump restoration is so deeply ingrained overseas that leaders in several countries have hedged their bets in diplomacy, security and even where they invest their fortunes.

There were few signs that Mr. Trump’s indictment last week on criminal charges in New York has changed those calculations.

Foreign leaders have watched him bounce back from so many disasters, according to diplomats and foreign policy experts, that they now regard his political resilience with something approaching fatalism. This is especially true in Europe, whose leaders spent four years enduring Mr. Trump’s hectoring on a host of issues, including military spending and climate change.

Even if Mr. Trump’s legal woes end his political viability in a way that two impeachments and an election defeat to Joseph R. Biden Jr. did not, many worry that he will be replaced by any number of Trump-like alternatives, of whom the Republican governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, is the most prominent example."

The home contained the wooden rocking chairs that the family of the Rev. Dwight Baldwin had shipped all the way from their East Coast home in the 1830s when he took over the compound, their son’s antique shell collection and the medical instruments that Dr. Baldwin, a missionary and physician, had used to vaccinate much of Maui against smallpox.

Unlike others in Lahaina whose families in the area stretch back generations, Ms. Morrison, 75, from Berkeley, Calif., happened upon the town while sailing around the Hawaiian islands in 1975. She said her mind was made up when she set out on foot around the town, once known as a vacation spot for Mark Twain and as a gathering point for whalers, now featuring art galleries and restaurants. “I walked down Front Street,” she said, “and decided this was my place.”

In the wake of the fire on Thursday, the sense of loss — of history, of community, of friends and family — was coming achingly into focus for many of those who had long lived there."

How the company that owns the factory, First Solar, managed to hang on when most solar panel manufacturing left the United States for China is critical to understanding the viability of President Biden’s efforts to establish a large domestic green energy industry.

Mr. Biden and Democrats in Congress last year authorized hundreds of billions of dollars in federal incentives for manufacturing solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, electric cars and semiconductors. The efforts amount to one of the most expansive uses of industrial policy ever attempted in the United States.

As a result, many companies, including First Solar, have announced the construction of dozens of factories, in total, around the country. But nobody is entirely sure whether these investments will be durable, especially in businesses, like battery or solar panel manufacturing, where China’s domination is deep and strong. Chinese manufacturers enjoy lower labor costs, economies of scale and incentives from a government eager to control industries critical to fighting climate change."

The states have also agreed to make additional cuts beyond the ones tied to the federal payments to generate the total reductions needed to prevent the collapse of the river.

Taken together, those reductions would amount to about 13 percent of the total water use in the lower Colorado Basin — among the most aggressive ever experienced in the region, and likely to require significant water restrictions for residential and agriculture uses.

The Colorado River supplies drinking water to 40 million Americans in seven states as well as part of Mexico and irrigates 5.5 million acres of farmland. The electricity generated by dams on the river’s two main reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, powers millions of homes and businesses."

Two variables related to average monthly trade value are: the amount of trade by country since the Feb. 24, 2022 invasion of Ukraine as represented by the width of the arrows and the percentage change in trade since the invasion as compared to the data for 2017 – 2021.

Constructor Notes

Shannon Rapp: I have drafts of this theme dating back to July 2021. I had three theme entries and a revealer but never found a fourth themed entry that spoke to me, so I put the puzzle in a drawer. More than a year later, when Rebecca and I were tooling around on other ideas, I mentioned this one to her offhand. In her trademark fashion, she dropped SPAGHETTI CODE on me 10 minutes later. That sealed the deal. Not only did Rebecca save this theme from the depths of my drafts folder, she also convinced me to send it to The Times. After receiving many rejections for other puzzles and finding success publishing crosswords elsewhere, I had all but given up on submitting to The Times. So it’s completely to her credit that this puzzle exists. I want to express my gratitude and appreciation to all my friends and collaborators in the crossword community — nothing without you! Rebecca Goldstein: I’m grateful that Shannon let me come along for the ride on this puzzle. Enjoy!

Since mutinous soldiers detained President Mohamed Bazoum of Niger on July 26, they have kept him isolated in his private residence in Niamey, the capital, with his wife and one of their sons; dissolved his government; and, according to U.S. officials, vowed to kill him if West African countries intervened militarily.

On Sunday, the junta member acting as a spokesman, Col. Amadou Abdramane, said that Mr. Bazoum would face charges of “high treason” and “undermining the internal and external security of Niger” after the democratically elected president spoke with foreign leaders and international organizations while in detention.

The coup in Niger last month set off one of the most severe political crises in recent years in West Africa, following a series of military takeovers in a region already troubled by Islamist insurgencies, some of the world’s most extreme effects of climate change and widespread poverty."

Hay wasn’t able to travel from Austin, Texas, where she lives, to Stockholm, so she created the work virtually; instead of choreographing a group work, it became this converging of solos. (She credits Jeanine Durning, one of her longtime performers and a rehearsal director at Cullberg, with the coaching.) The shutdown of theaters also canceled the work’s original premiere, so Hay proposed an alternative: Why not have the dancers perform the work without an audience? What might they glean from that experience?

In “Dear Dancer,” a short film directed by Marcus Lindeen exploring the creation of “Horse,” Hay refers to her process of asking questions as a “lifetime project” in which the “value of the experiment is to keep it going even if you are the only witness of your own dancing.”

Because of the pandemic, that kind of expression isn’t so limited or alien: For many during the shutdown, dancing with no one watching became a reality. In “Horse” — now with spectators — Hay takes that idea further, creating the sensation that we are witnessing individual worlds. The dancers rarely touch; moments of close encounter become part of the work’s fabric. The dancers don’t even perform for each other as much as for themselves. And all the while, “Horse” completely ignores us, the audience. It’s such a relief.

But in the spirit of Hay, questions persist: Are they even performing? What is a performance? “Horse” is both boring and beautiful; it’s like falling in love with a piece of lace. Hay’s work requires patience and a willingness to pay attention — it’s an accumulation of slight shifts of rhythm, the articulation of joints and unwavering focus. After the dancers performed the work without an audience in March 2021, Hay writes that they “soared, at least this is what they told me.”

Most compelling was that in this live setting, they hung onto that feeling of performing for no one. They bowed, but without needing love. It was strangely thrilling.

The agreements came about three weeks after the center-right Popular Party crushed Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez’s left-wing coalition in regional and local elections. To secure control of dozens of cities, the Popular Party struck coalition deals with the far-right Vox, which also performed well, embracing part of the party’s nationalist, anti-migrant agenda.

Both parties will now govern together in some 25 cities of more than 30,000 residents, including five regional capitals, giving Vox, a party once considered anathema by most voters, crucial political leverage. They have also teamed up to run the wealthy Valencia region, which accounts for 10 percent of Spain’s population.

“It’s something completely new, both in terms of extent and depth,” Sandra León, a political analyst at Carlos III University in Madrid, said of the alliances. “It opens up a new path, a new period in the right-wing bloc.”"

At a cocktail party this week in Davos, one executive told DealBook something he — and most of the attendees at the World Economic Forum — would most likely never say in public: “I hope E.S.G. just goes away.”

The executive, whose company is involved in the carbon industry, clarified that he still believes that it is vital to focus on climate, but that environmental, social and corporate governance — as the business approach is formally known — has become too broad and distracting. He’s just one of many executives who have talked to DealBook about coming to terms with how politically charged E.S.G. has become, and about how to deal with it.

Have executives overpromised on E.S.G.? Fixating on lofty goals, without delivering on actions, has made business leaders vulnerable to a backlash, executives said. As evidence, some point to BlackRock’s Larry Fink, one of the earliest and most vocal proponents of E.S.G., saying he’s trying to “change the narrative” after taking fire from the right, and despite the fact that the asset manager still has investments tied to fossil fuels. The elevated messaging, and the pushback to it, has also obscured what supporters of the movement say are the real financial considerations of E.S.G., like what climate change means for a real estate business.

One finance executive compared the current “Davos era” approach to E.S.G. with other once-popular management philosophies, like the Six Sigma system embraced by the former G.E. boss Jack Welch. While investing with purpose probably won’t go away, the executive at Davos said, this particular flavor of E.S.G. may."

It is an important marker for a politically shifting continent, and a pregnant moment for a country that has long grappled with the legacy of its dictatorship.

Even before Spaniards cast a single ballot, it has raised questions of where the country’s political heart actually lies — whether its painful past and transition to democracy only four decades ago have rendered Spain a mostly moderate, inclusive and centrist country, or whether it could veer toward extremes once again."

Pushed into this ever-smaller corner, the Ukrainian army is determined to hunker down and hold out, even as allies have quietly questioned the rationale for fighting block by block in a devastated city that is close to being encircled, according to recently leaked U.S. intelligence documents.

Strategy: In Kyiv’s assessment, holding out in these grim conditions is a strategic imperative, to bog down the Russian Army while Ukraine rearms and retrains its own military for a coming counteroffensive."

As water sources, particularly in the western United States, dry up from overuse, drought and climate change, supporters of direct potable reuse — the use of treated wastewater in the drinking water supply — are pitching it as part of the solution. Increasingly, they are turning to beer as a way of getting people beyond the “ick factor” that has been a hurdle to its broader acceptance.

But his fiery intervention in the immigration debate has drawn a tart response from government ministers and other Conservative politicians, who say the law is needed to curb the number of migrants who illegally cross the English Channel in small boats.

“He’s wrong on both counts,” the immigration minister, Robert Jenrick, told the BBC. “There’s nothing moral about allowing the pernicious trade of people smugglers to continue,” he said. “I disagree with him respectfully.”"

But he also explored his own concerns about the state’s out-of-control housing market: that his college-age daughters may never be able to afford to live in the region where they grew up, and might be forced to move far from nearly everyone they know.

“I had been really raised and was deeply sympathetic to a view that real estate development is always wrong, always speculative, always venal,” Daniel told me. “So when I started to follow the YIMBY arguments, I became interested in what a political and ideological inversion it was, on this really key point, from the values in which I had been raised.”

He said writing the article was an important way “for me to simultaneously keep my heart open to what it all really meant to my parents and their neighbors, while keeping my mind alive to what the stakes are for me and my kids, and everybody else’s kids — and the nature of the society we’re building, or not building.”

The front-runner for the Republican nomination, Donald J. Trump, was in Michigan last week, reeling off a rambling bill of particulars against E.V.s, complaining falsely that they run out of power in 15 minutes, are bad for the environment, and would destroy the domestic auto industry within a few short years.

Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, a distant second to Mr. Trump in national polls, recently railed against electric vehicles when he unveiled an energy policy platform that promised to roll back E.V. subsidies to “support Americans’ right to drive the cars they want.” Mike Pence, Mr. Trump’s former vice president-turned-competitor, agrees with Mr. Ramaswamy and others that the transition to electric vehicles would send American auto manufacturing to China.

Opposing electric cars — and the industry’s ongoing shift away from internal-combustion engines to battery power — allows Republican candidates to criticize China, the dominant economic force in the battery industry. It also pleases G.O.P. voters still hostile to the notion of climate change — what Mr. Ramaswamy disparaged Wednesday night as “that God-forsaken religion, the climate cult” and “the E.V. subsidy cult” — and to all things environmental and “woke.” And it evokes a nostalgic halcyon past, the same one that Mr. Trump conjured when he promised in 2016 to bring back coal mines, steel mills and basic manufacturing.

But the steel mills and coal mines failed to roar back to their glory days, and the internal-combustion engine is unlikely to as well. In fact, the electric vehicle transition is well underway.

That transition is driven in part by President Biden’s policies, which subsidize the manufacturing and purchasing of E.V.s and their components and impose strict fuel economy standards on automakers that can be met with zero-emission electric cars. But it’s also motivated by Detroit executives who have vowed to convert their corporations to all electric, by consumers reacting to environmental concerns and gas prices, and by aggressive policies from governments like those of California, Britain and Europe that are beyond the reach of a Republican White House."

In the early 2010s, the Irish-born New York-based artist had worked for five years in the Democratic Republic of Congo, photographing and filming the humanitarian disaster that has claimed millions of lives and displaced millions more. That project led to another video and photographic series focusing on the European refugee crisis unfolding around the Mediterranean. Before that, he had embedded with the U.S. Army in Iraq.

“I was exhausted,” Mosse said recently, as he recounted the events that led to his latest film installation, “Broken Spectre,” filmed in the Amazon rainforest from 2018 to 2021. “I thought I’d put the superego aside, and just enjoy the simple pleasures of photography. This project essentially began with portraits of orchids.”

Mosse booked himself into a remote ecolodge in the Ecuadorean cloud forest, and began photographing plants, lichens, mycelium and insects with a macro lens. He found that many organisms phosphoresce under ultraviolet light, so he created dramatic Technicolor images of the teeming biodiversity on the forest floor."

Today’s New York still has filthy streets, plus population density and aging infrastructure, making it a perfect home for its rats. The core strategy for managing these animals must be disrupting that perfect home by limiting their access to human food and buildings. Mr. Adams and Kathleen Corradi, his new rat czar, deserve credit for beginning to pursue this strategy, but it will take every New Yorker’s help to succeed.

City agencies have heavily relied on using rat poison; in 2021 alone, they applied over 60,000 pounds of rodenticide poisons. From 2015 to 2021, they doubled their use of anticoagulants that kill rats by slowly causing internal bleeding. The mass deployment of poison across our streets can hurt predators up the food chain as well. It takes only one unsecured bait box to poison a curious family dog."

A nuclear decision maker might be unsure of whether a missile is really in the air, how high a nuke’s yield is, why the missile was launched or whether more missiles will follow.

Another of Dr. Cerf’s studies involves climate change. It found that when people were asked to stake money on climate outcomes, they would bet that global warming was happening, and they were more concerned about its impact, more supportive of action and more knowledgeable about relevant issues — even if they began as skeptics. “You basically change your own brain without anyone telling you anything,” Dr. Cerf said.

He thinks the results could be applied to nuclear scenarios because you could use bets to make people care about nuclear risk and support changes to policy. The findings could also be used to evaluate the thinking and prediction of aides who advise the president.

Some scholars of decision science don’t agree on such extrapolations.

“To go from there to giving advice on the fate of the world — I don’t think so,” said Baruch Fischhoff, a psychologist who studies decision making at Carnegie Mellon University.

He doesn’t have to say it. His reverence for Franklin Roosevelt’s response to the Great Depression and his hope that President Biden learns the right lesson from it is evident on every page.

For Kuttner, a founder of The American Prospect, that lesson is clear: America has prospered when the federal government has gone “big,” acting to tame the market and temper “the economic and political power of capital.” Roosevelt regulated banks, created jobs through infrastructure projects, provided unemployment relief, established the minimum wage and Social Security, backed organized labor, guaranteed home and farm loans, and taxed the rich.

The gains were fragile, Kuttner writes, “built on circumstances and luck more than enduring structural change.” They came only with compromise, most consequentially with segregationists and other enemies of racial equality, North and South. Many gains were reversed when presidents, including Democrats, beginning with Jimmy Carter, advocated a smaller government and a less regulated market.

In the 2020 presidential primaries, the New Deal Democrats were Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Kuttner assumed Biden would continue Barack Obama’s combination of social liberalism and economic conservatism, which during the Great Recession included the no-fault bailout of the big banks and the preference for deficit reduction over additional economic stimulus. That combination, Kuttner believes, slowed the recovery and contributed to Donald Trump’s appeal among white working-class voters."

That’s one of our recommended books this week.

Cosby’s latest, “All the Sinners Bleed,” sets a memorably warped serial killer on the loose in a small Southern town. (Stephen King, who knows something about scary books, wrote our review of that one.)

There’s more: a vampire romance, an expansive novel about India’s national identity, a biography of Cleopatra Selene and a look at the Supreme Court’s backstage machinations. Finally, Melissa Sevigny’s “Brave the Wild River” tells a story of scientific discovery and wilderness adventure minus the terrifying flames, as it looks back on the pioneering female botanists who joined a 1938 expedition in the Grand Canyon. Happy reading.

ALL THE SINNERS BLEED

S.A. Cosby

In his earlier thrillers, Cosby worked the outlaw side of the crime/suspense genre. In his new one — about a Black sheriff in a rural Southern town, searching for a serial killer who tortures Black children — he’s written a crackling good police procedural."

I’m Ezra Klein. This is the “Ezra Klein Show.” [MUSIC PLAYING] Something I’ve noticed is when I do episodes that are deep in the arts or the humanities, I feel the need to really put my shoulder into selling them. If it’s a show on Ukraine or the Republican Party, the topic sells itself. But poetry — does poetry sell itself? But I want to try to avoid that kind of intro here. Because this is a lovely episode, in part because it’s not a linear argument that is easy to describe. And that is, I think, the point of it, too, that great poetry is not a linear argument. It’s an effort to get beyond that way of thinking about the world, to open yourself up to the deficiencies of it, an effort I’m trying to make more and more myself these days. So my guest today is Jane Hirshfield. She’s a poet. She’s the author of many collections of poetry, including her most recent “Ledger,” which is probably the book of poetry I’ve gifted to others most often. She’s also the author of two very beautiful books of essays on poetry and how it works and the poetic mind. And if you are intimidated by poetry, I really recommend these, “Nine Gates, Entering the Mind of Poetry” and “Ten Windows, How Great Poems Transform the World.” As always, my email, ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. Jane Hirshfield, welcome to the show.

jane hirshfield

Thank you. It’s wonderful to be here.

ezra klein

One thing that has shifted in your poetry in recent years is that it has turned to the climate crisis. You said in an interview that during the years when you were writing “Ledger,” which is the newer collection, the crisis of the biosphere went from something imagined as future to something current, arrived. How did that shift in your sense of it change your poetry?

jane hirshfield

Well, the shift changed me. I had felt a sense of urgency — forgive me for revealing my age, but — since 1970, when I went to the very first Earth Day. It’s not as though everything we are living through now was not knowable then. Carter had solar panels on the White House roof. Imagine if we had paid attention 50 years ago. But with the California fires and drought, with the Christmas tsunami, which is the one thing which, I suppose, was not a man-made event but recalibrated the man-made ones — made me think about the ethical difference between what we have caused and the — forgive this word — ordinary catastrophes of the natural world. It simply became — I had been writing about climate for a long time. I had been writing about the imperiled natural world for a long time. But it became urgent when it became clear it was no longer future. It was here.

ezra klein

Could you read for me the poem “Let Them Not Say,” which is one of the poems that opens up “Ledger“?

jane hirshfield

Yes. “Let them not say. Let them not say we did not see it. We saw. Let them not say we did not hear it. We heard. Let them not say they did not taste it. We ate. We trembled. Let them not say it was not spoken, not written. We spoke, we witnessed with voices and hands. Let them not say they did nothing. We did not enough. Let them say, as they must say something, a kerosene beauty. It burned. Let them say we warmed ourselves by it, read by its light, praised, and it burned.”

ezra klein

There’s a striking moment in that poem to me around a kerosene beauty.

jane hirshfield

Yes.

ezra klein

And I read that as you acknowledging that a lot of what we’ve invented, a lot of what we’ve done, a lot of the damage we’ve done has a beauty to it, a wonder to it. Air travel is beautiful. Electric light is beautiful. Trains are beautiful. Tell me about the act, the decision, the intuition to acknowledge that beauty in a poem motivated by this kind of fear of the future’s judgment.

jane hirshfield

Well, I think that is key to what makes a poem be a poem, is that it is not an advertisement. It is not a piece of propaganda. It is not a screed. It is something which tries to see the wholeness of things from every angle and every side in order to see more clearly, truly, to feel more deeply, widely, and, perhaps, tenderly. And I’m so glad that that line struck you, because it is a key line. And it is perfectly true. It also holds — besides holding the beauty of everything we have made and the instrumentality of everything we have made, I have spent years reading by kerosene lamps. And I always feel, if I’m going to speak of these things, that the poem should hold some acknowledgment of the fact that I, too, am creating the problem. I drive a car. I fly on airplanes. I have electric lights. And my own complicity in what we are doing must be acknowledged. No good poem is ever going to be accusatory. A bad poem might be. But a good poem will not do only that. And what this poem is was trying to do, I think, was trying to find — because when I begin my poems, I don’t know what they are going to say. I know the first few words that start them, and then I find out what I’m going to say — I knew that I myself am amongst all of us who are making this future, which will look back on us and see what we have done and whether we have done not enough or not.

ezra klein

What do you mean when you say that when you begin a poem, you don’t know what you’re going to say?

jane hirshfield

The only thing I knew when I started this poem was the opening words of it: Let them not say. Those words came into my mind. And then the next words came into my mind: We did not see it. And then the next words came into my mind: We saw. I had some sense that during that time — this was written in 2014 — writing into the crisis of the biosphere was much on my mind. So that was in my unconscious. But consciously, when I write a poem, I listen. I almost never have a preconceived idea of what I’m trying to do or how I’m trying to do it. I have something that troubles me, that fractures me, that requires a different kind of thought and feeling in order to be worked through. And out of that sense, some words will come. I think a poem is a collaboration of conscious and unconscious minds, the way a dream is.

ezra klein

Tell me about something you said a moment ago, which is that a good poem is never accusatory.

jane hirshfield

So, for me — there might be somebody else who would have a different definition of a good poem, and they are entitled to their own taste and their own preferences. But, for me, if a poem points a finger and shakes it at another person, it is a narrowing of understanding. You can do that without poetry. You don’t need a poem to say j’accuse and point your finger. But poems are, for me, always an attempt to see from more than one point of view in more than one way, to enlist the collaboration of tongue, heart, mind, body, everything I have ever experienced, and to try to write into an awareness which is larger than the everyday, walking around forms of thought. Walking around in the everyday, I can have a flash of anger towards certain decisions which are made in the halls of power. But that’s not poetry. Poetry is almost the opposite of that. Poetry is the attempt to understand fully what is real, what is present, what is it imaginable, what is feelable, and how can I loosen the grip of what I already know to find some new, changed relationship, to find something I didn’t know until the poem was written and finished? And then I know something new, and I have been changed. So the thing about a simple accusation, what’s different before and after that? Nothing. You knew how you felt before, and you knew how you felt after, and there’s been no transformation. But for me, poems are vessels of transformation. They are the glass crucible that a chemical reaction takes place in. And what comes out at the end is a different thing than what went in at the beginning.

ezra klein

One of the things that has attracted me to reading a lot more poetry in the last couple of years — and yours in particular — is — I want to call it a fascination, but I think I mean a yearning to have a more poetic mind. And I don’t mean, in that, artistic or beautiful. But I mean something more along the lines of what you’re saying, which is an openness, that openness to transformation. And so I’m curious here not so much about the artifact of the poem, but the relationship between that state you’re in, that receiving state, where you describe almost channeling something and the production of the thing. We can say what a poem does or doesn’t do. But I’m interested in how you attain that state where you can do that.

jane hirshfield

Yeah. So for me, it is recognizably a different condition of being than the person who goes out and buys groceries. Now, when I was young, there was a quicker oscillation between the two. And maybe when I was going out to buy groceries, I would more often be hit by a poem right that moment, and stop and write it down. But in recent decades, I need to find my way to a more vulnerable and permeable state of being, where I can hear the voice which is otherwise drowned out by what Gregory Bateson used to call purposive consciousness. And purposive consciousness is very useful to our species, but it is not the entirety of how we know the world, or how we navigate the world, or even how we change the world. My experience is, I must be quiet. I must feel protected, so protected time and space. I can’t write a poem if part of my mind is thinking, oh, at 10:30, I need to leave to go see the dentist. Because I need to be able to fall into the condition of listening and dreaming through words and sounds and music and images that arise and magnetize themselves into being. And you can’t be watching the clock and do that. And you can’t be expecting the phone to ring. And you certainly can’t be checking for emails. And so this sense of a sort of monastery of consciousness, a sequestration, a rowboat in the middle of the lake — everybody will have their own image for this. But I think only when I feel that I can deepen my relationship to what I hear and see and feel and allow to come through me, that’s when the discoveries are made. And writing is an act of discovery.

ezra klein

I want to ask you, then, to read — I think what may be my favorite poem of yours, which is from your book “The Beauty,” called “My Skeleton.”

jane hirshfield

Mm. “My Skeleton. My skeleton, who once ached with your own growing larger, are now each year imperceptibly smaller, lighter, absorbed by your own concentration. When I danced, you danced. When you broke, I. And so it was lying down, walking, climbing the tiring stairs. Your jaws. My bread. Someday you, what is left of you, will be flensed of this marriage. Angular wristbone’s arthritis, cracked harp of rib cage, blunt of heel, open bowl of the skull, twin platters of pelvis — each of you will leave me behind, at last serene. What did I know of your days, your nights, I who held you all my life inside my hands and thought they were empty? You who held me all your life in your hands as a new mother holds her own unblanketed child, not thinking at all.”

ezra klein

One thing I appreciate about this poem, which is true for a lot of your poems, is that it brings a very close awareness to something that is always close to us, and we are very rarely aware of. And I’m curious — because it is something you do often — how that process works for you.

jane hirshfield

So thank you, first, for noticing that. Because I do think that for me, one large element that goes into this life of poem-making is a matter of noticing what is ordinarily unnoticed, both for me personally and also for poetry’s work in the world. Other things can look at what’s in the spotlight. Poems like to look at what’s out at the periphery and find out what can be learned from that. So here we are, always walking around inside what will someday become our skeleton, at least, momentarily. And I began to think about it. And I began to think about it. There has been an increasing awareness of science in my poems for quite a long time now. And some of the things in here that might slip by without noticing are just scientifically true. So that a skeleton each year grows imperceptibly smaller, lighter, absorbed by your own concentration, that happens. First, the skeleton grows and grows stronger. And then in an increased age, we all know older people get smaller. And this is by a process of the bone being absorbed. And so this fact, which I’d probably been carrying around for many years before I wrote the poem, suddenly stepped forward and began the speaking of it. And then once I had the idea of, oh, what is my relationship to my skeleton? And, why haven’t I noticed it much? Why haven’t I given it its full credit and gratitude for all the work it’s doing for me all my time? And, of course, we will go our separate ways at some point. And, what of that? And the process of thinking this through, of saying this through, of thinking “your jaws, my bread” also became, during the writing of the poem, an investigation, which carries on through a lot of the poems. The opening section of this book, “The Beauty,” that came out in 2015, it starts with a run of poems whose title is all “my” something or other. And taken as a whole — I realized after I had written them — they are all investigating, where does the self begin and end? This question of, is my skeleton me? Am I it? And, what do we do about the fact that selves aren’t actually terribly stable or definable things? Because they are, in the end, inseparable from everything. They are wonderful narratives. They are stories we usefully walk around inside of that evolution gave our species, this world of ideas and concepts and self-regard and the feeling that our own fate is very important for us to take care of. But I was also very interested in, what is our interconnection to what is beyond my own fate? And my skeleton is mostly beyond my own fate. It was given to me. And maybe it makes a difference if I run every day or don’t run every day or what I eat. But it has its own life. And we conduct ourselves, for however many decades on Earth, as a kind of chorus of two, my lived life and my physical body that it cannot ever happen without.

ezra klein

This gets, for me, at something that has been striking about — I don’t want to suggest I have enough awareness of poetry to say modern poetry. But a lot of the poetry I seem to read, which is — I think there’s a reputation of poetry, particularly, contemporary poetry, as very abstract, very intellectualized. And yet, so much of it is about bodies, animals and the natural world.

jane hirshfield

Yes.

ezra klein

There’s a deep, intense focus on the tangible material existence we have, in a way that now seems quite different to me than other intellectual disciplines. And I’m curious why — first, if that feels right to you. But if so, why do you think that is?

jane hirshfield

Well, it feels entirely right to me. But I do think that our job as poets — as I mentioned a little bit earlier, one of the jobs of all art is to look at what the central focus of the culture is not looking at. And one of those things in our current moment is certainly embodiment, not the body as object of ads about how to make it more attractive, but our actually lived, embodied knowledge, experience, and the complete joyousness of remembering that we are animals. It is also, I think, one of the ways that poetry expands the knowable. Don’t forget the word “know” itself. There’s the biblical meaning of know, which is carnal knowledge, which is get into bed together and have a wonderful time. That is part of what human beings need to know. It is also part of the seat of our sense of ethics, our sense of justice or injustice. These are bodily informed. All of the emotions are felt physiologically. You can name where in the body you feel them, how they are turning, whether we find them enormously pleasurable or excruciatingly painful. And this is the information of a social species. It is extraordinarily important that we honor and preserve that, or we will just continually be slaughtering one another because we haven’t got the subtlety to recognize, oh, I have just created a separation, and that makes it harder to be with this person and do something with them, and I need to correct that somehow. Or, I have just embarrassed myself terribly. And the three excruciating emotions are shame, embarrassment, anxiety. Grief is pure. Grief is unbearable but bearable. Embarrassment is just unbearable. It is through the body that we know these things. And when it is unbearable and excruciating, we have learned, quite sharply: Behave differently. So poems hold this physical love of the world, affection for the world. And, again, we will not save this Earth and all the beings upon it because it’s a good idea. We will save this Earth and its beings because we love it. We love them. We love life. We love being alive for the moment or two that we are in the immense span of time. And poetry is where you get to dwell in these things. Because it’s not trying to do other things. It is its task to reunite us with the senses, with our hungers, with our emotions, with our physical connection to the bones inside of our hands that we so often ignore — unless we have arthritis and they hurt.

ezra klein

I want to go back to something you gestured at there, which is what we do and don’t know of the body. My favorite stanza in that poem is, “What did I know of your days, your nights, I who held you all my life inside my hands and thought they were empty?” A couple of years ago, I read a book about emotion by Lisa Feldman Barrett. And one of the big points of that book is that emotions are constructed as we interocept, as we get sensation from the body. But part of what’s interesting about that is how much sensation we don’t get, which, when you start thinking about it, is really strange. I mean, do we feel arthritis in the hands? Or I can feel digestion, or I can feel my breath if I concentrate. But I can’t feel protein synthesis or cells replicating or thinking — I don’t feel electricity going across my brain. I don’t feel anything that my liver is doing at the moment. It’s very strange how much is happening in the body, and we are getting no sense data from that. So the line, “What did I know of your days,” I know nothing of its days, almost. And yet, if any of those things stop happening, that’s the end of the thing I think of as me.

jane hirshfield

Exactly so, exactly so. And, slightly strange association, the wonderful thinker Ivan Illich wrote a book called “Shadow Work” some decades ago, where he talked about all of the unacknowledged labors that sustain communities and what actually happens in the world. But within our bodies, there is an enormous amount of shadow work going on. And every once in a while, I get to stop and thank it. Because that’s what poems can do, is they can look and say, ah, I forgot to be grateful for the fact that the bones in my feet are all working. Then I can look up in this strange world of information we live in. And when I write a poem that talks about our hands, I can rather quickly find that there are 54 bones in our hands and put that in the poem, which is in a different poem in “Ledger,” I think it is. And somehow, crossing the barricade between what is foreground and what is background is very important to me for my own sense of leading as full and broad a life as I am able to, to take more and more of the unseen and — at least once or twice in a life — bow in its direction, recognize how interconnected and dependent all things are and how continuous we are with those we love, with our friends, with the community that sustains us, with the strangers who we will never meet, but who are all making this world together, and then with the cells and the trees and the lizards. There is that old idea, Lynn Margulis, the Gaia hypothesis, that in fact, this world — that we are part of a single-bodied world, Gaia, the same way that the cells of my wrist bones are part of me. [MUSIC PLAYING]

ezra klein

I think that’s a nice place to ask you to read another poem, which is from right next door in the same collection, “My Proteins.”

jane hirshfield

Yes. So the one thing I need to say before reading this for people is to remind them that the word “protein” comes from the Greek god Proteus. And the way proteins work is by folding and unfolding. That’s how they do the work they do in the body. So the poem began with a New York Times Science Times page article saying that scientists had figured out how itch works. So it began with talking about itch. But somewhere along the line, it morphed into the — then not much spoken of, but now pretty widely recognized — microbiome, that there are millions of small beings making their lives inside of us. And that’s part of it all too. That’s part of the story of self, non-self, beyond self. “My Proteins. They have discovered, they say, the protein of itch — natriuretic polypeptide b — and that it travels its own distinct pathway inside my spine. As do pain, pleasure and heat. A body it seems is a highway, a cloverleaf crossing well built, well traversed. Some of me going north, some going south. Ninety percent of my cells, they have discovered, are not my own person, they are other beings inside me. As ninety-six percent of my life is not my life. Yet I, they say, am they — my bacteria and yeasts, my father and mother, grandparents, lovers, my drivers talking on cell phones, my subways and bridges, my thieves, my police who chase myself night and day. My proteins, apparently also me, fold the shirts. I find in this crowded metropolis, a quiet corner where I build of not-me LEGO blocks a bench, pigeons, a sandwich of rye bread, mustard, and cheese. It is me and is not, the hunger that makes the sandwich good. It is not me then is, the sandwich — a mystery neither of us can fold, unfold, or consume.” So yes, that does rather illustrate everything we have just been talking about. When I was a child, I would lie in bed at night and ponder, when I eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, when does it stop being a sandwich and start being Jane? So I was a very metaphysical child.

ezra klein

That’s a wonderful cone.

jane hirshfield

Yeah, and the question still comes back.

ezra klein

Tell me about that fascination for you between the experience of the coherent self — I sit here. I use the first person pronoun. I am thinking thoughts. I am talking to you — and then the remarkable amount of evidence, both scientific and then when you sit there and a thought bubbles up that you had no volition around, that there is more complexity to the compositional creature I am in that.

jane hirshfield

So I think this sense of the self as, at the very least, permeable, if not entirely constructed, it really has been a lifelong theme for me. It has been something that, perhaps, I felt first and thought second. It’s such a mystery. We were born into a world. We clearly — at birth, all we can do is open our eyes in absolute, stunned wonder and maybe giggle or feel various pains and processes that our bodies aren’t used to doing. And then somehow, we get integrated into a social structure, a family, friends, schools, larger communities. And we’ve got an I that we need to take care of. There’s a reason that pronoun exists in whatever grammar any particular language carries it in. But I think our task as beings — for me, my task as a being has always been to try to make that sense larger and larger, and less fixed, and less in the grip of the narrowest forms of self-service, and more available to the larger interconnection, which we are equally and indelibly part of. It gets into things like mystical experience. Mystics of every tradition all over the world — shamans, the Judeo-Christian tradition, Hindi, mystics — anywhere you look in the world — Indigenous people — there is some embodiment of the understanding of the self dropping away. And for me, these have been, perhaps, the most important moments of my life. And you don’t even need to be in the realm of the spiritual for this. There’s a marvelous book by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi called “Flow” that probably many of your listeners know. And in that book, he talks about how you can fall into any task any task which is difficult enough to take your whole concentration. People get a glimpse, a moment of the baseball is coming towards you. And suddenly, it is in slow motion, and you can see every seam. Or the mathematical problem becomes three-dimensional and beautiful to you. Or you are listening to a piece of music, and there is only the music. There’s no Jane. There’s no Ezra. There’s only the music. And for most of us, these are rare and occasional glimpses. Barbara Ehrenreich wrote a book saying that she thought it was much more ubiquitous than we give credit to in the way that we talk to one another. But after that came out, I was at a very large lunch table. And I just decided to ask everyone at the table — without putting them on the spot, I hoped, but just as a sort of conversation starter: Have you had a mystical experience? When you were a child, did you have a mystical experience? And it wasn’t quite everyone, as Barbara Ehrenreich had proposed. It was 80 percent had had something, especially in childhood. And for me, these experiences, they just recalibrate, not only my heart and my awareness, but they also recalibrate my ethics. If you don’t think that your fate is separate and single, you will behave differently in this world.

ezra klein

Have you had a mystical experience?

jane hirshfield

Well, in my own tradition, one isn’t supposed to answer that question. It’s considered — you don’t want to trot these things out and talk about them too much. But I think you can intuit the answer from that.

ezra klein

One of the interesting things about that Barbara Ehrenreich book — and I had had her on the show back in the Vox days. And she died recently and is a — for people who’ve not read her, she’s a remarkable writer.

jane hirshfield

Yes, she is.

ezra klein

But she was known as a very leading and very public atheist. And later in life, wrote this book, in part about this mystical experience, as she describes it at times, of a world of flame that she had when she was much younger and was never quite able to shake. And even in our interview, talked about not quite knowing what to make of that book that she wrote herself and not always being sure she should have written it. But one thing that I appreciated about that book — and I see it sometimes in your poetry — is I think when I was growing up, I was told that the science and religion division was between a kind of pragmatic, material, reductionist science and a wondrous, mystic, open, curious — although, sometimes dogmatic — religion. And as I’ve gotten older and looked and studied more science, it’s become — I mean, it has been since before I was born, but I’m more aware of it now — it is so unbelievably weird and wondrous. And the microbiome all the way to quantum physics to — without getting into, I think, very pop versions of these, it is, I think, impossible to bring the appropriate wonder and humility to how different the world is on its fundamental levels and how we experience it. To be reductionist about it all, it has always struck me now as a little bit absurd. Because you can’t read a new paper these days without being sort of flattened anew by a world that simply does not owe you an experience it accords to its reality.

jane hirshfield

[SIGHS] Where to even to begin to talk about all of that? So I know most of the friends of this last several decades of my life are research scientists. And you’ve never met a group of people more susceptible to wonder, awe and, sometimes, the mystical dropping away of experience. There is no division. C.P. Snow’s book about the two cultures, that’s such a memorable phrase, that to this day, we have this idea of these binary ways of being in the world. But I once did an on-stage conversation for the L.A. main public library with the astrophysicist, Sean Carroll. And the subject which was given us was ways of knowing. And we talked about all the ways of knowing that, within science and poetry, are exactly the same. There is no separation when you are searching for a new description of what is all around you. The same openness is required. The same experimentation is required. The same imagination is required. There’s a marvelous quote, the Russian novelist and occasional poet, Vladimir Nabokov, who was also a lepidopterist, said something along the lines of, we must think with the precision of poets and the imagination of scientists. And I just love how he mixed up the terms in there.

ezra klein

Or didn’t.

jane hirshfield

Exactly, exactly. Both require both. And I think this experience of self falling away into a larger — just, shiver of experience, awareness, that is not contained, that is its own fullness and sufficiency, that is available to all people. And religion might have come out of it, but it does not confine it. It does not define it. It does not hold it. It is simply a place where people who are especially susceptible to that experience might go. Although, in the case of some religions, they might actually not go. Because it depends on the religion and what it is promulgating. You can’t divide the world up like a curriculum in a catalog. Because human beings will experience what they experience and feel what they feel and know what they know. We can’t be put into compartments.

ezra klein

You have this lovely line that you wrote in an email to us where you said, quote, “Art slips through the psyche’s barbed wire. It lessens division and increases kinship.” And I see a lot of your work — but “My Proteins” is maybe a good way into it — as being about this question of kinship.

jane hirshfield

Yes.

ezra klein

It’s well and good to have an interesting inquiry about the borders of the self and when the sandwich becomes Jane and when Jane becomes sandwich. But this question of kinship is a little less intellectual, much more urgent, given the power humans have — and also the power we have in relationship to each other, not just to the natural world. I’m curious about that relationship for you, between art and kinship.

jane hirshfield

So I think it is in the very bone marrow of poetry and all art to work through a vocabulary of connection and recognition of the profound interdependence and interconnection of everything. And it travels both ways. It travels — sure, we humans might project a sense of kinship. But we are also part of a fabric of the heart’s ecology, which is how the world is sustained. And I don’t want to go to the obvious, but all of the new research about trees and how it turns out that through a mycorrhizal map of underground connections, they are feeding one another, they are communicating to one another, they are kin. And from childhood, that just felt to me a correct sense of the world, that if you are not frightened and you are not angry, everything you look at, you will say — as Saint Francis of Assisi said in the title of his famous “Canticle,” Brother Sun, Sister Moon, that we are all in it together. And that is not the dominant sense of our current culture. But I think it is the means of art making that, as I have often taught when I’m talking about poems in that context, every description is not only a description of the outer world, it is a depiction of a state of soul. Because that is how we work. It’s one large kinship system — and not only between us and other human beings. I really like the idea of looking at a tree and saying uncle, thank you. Thank you, cousin, sister.

ezra klein

Can you read for me your poem “A Cedary Fragrance?”

jane hirshfield

Mm. “A Cedary Fragrance. Even now, decades after, I wash my face with cold water — not for discipline, nor memory, nor the icy, awakening slap, but to practice choosing to make the unwanted wanted.”

ezra klein

Decades later from what?

jane hirshfield

Ah. The poem is thinking back to the time that — for many years, I didn’t want to talk about this in public because it gives people a lot of ideas that I would prefer them not holding. But I spent my twenties in formal Zen training and three of those years in a wilderness monastery inland from Big Sur called Zen Mountain Center at a place on Tassajara Creek. And for those three years, I was living without electricity, with kerosene lanterns, with no heat in the cabins. And in those years, we only had plastic over them in winter and screens in summer and only cold water tap in the bathroom. Although, rather fortunately, Tassajara is a hot springs. And so once a day, you could actually get warm in winter. Because at bath time, you could go have a hot bath. So this poem remembers back to those years of waking up in the morning at 3:40 in the morning, which is the time that Zen monks awaken, and washed my face with cold water. And after I left — and I don’t like cold water. I really don’t. I still don’t, to this day. But I never stopped that practice for exactly what this poem is trying to point towards or talk about or hold — not discipline, not memory, not the icy, awakening slap, but to practice choosing, to make the unwanted wanted, just to do something that you never thought you would want. And yet, at this point, I would not change that. Actually, I give myself dispensation if I’m traveling. If I’m in a hotel room, I’ll wash my face with hot water. Because I like it. But at home, always cold. And we’ve sort of changed the corner. This is a poem about a very different theme, and again, another quite lifelong one, which is — I never liked to name my themes, but I’ve reached the point where I’m willing to. I’ve written many, many poems out of the need to find a way to say yes to what I would, at first, rather say no to. Because our whole lives consist of such moments. Many things will happen to us that we would prefer not. We would prefer our loved ones don’t die. I would prefer the world were more sensible and kind and compassionate. I would prefer there not to be forest fires of such extraordinary devastation as we’ve been having, or fill in the blank. But a human life requires all of these things. And so to every day begin the day with this simple affirmation of “I will make the unwanted unwanted” has been a practice of decades for me now.

ezra klein

Tell me about the act of choosing to make something that sounds very difficult to want wanted in that larger sense, to spend three years as a wilderness monk without electricity, you said in your twenties, when you could have been out in the Bay Area, partying and taking psychedelics.

jane hirshfield

Oh, I did my partying before that. [LAUGHS]

ezra klein

Who were you that you made that choice, and what was that choice like for you?

jane hirshfield

So from childhood, I wrote poems. As soon as I learned how to write, I was writing poems. My mother pulled out a sheet of paper when my first small press book came out, saying — one of those big sheets where you’re just learning how to write, brown sheet with the wide, blue lines on it. And it said, I want to be a writer when I grow up. So that was what I had always wanted, and that was what I had aimed myself toward. But you can’t just be a writer. You have to be a person. And I knew that I would never be much of a writer at all if I did not know much more about how to be a human being. And for me — not for everyone, just me and a few others built the same way — entering formal Zen practice felt like a way to find out more what it is to be a human being, to learn how to pay attention, to learn how to not be afraid of discomfort, or being tired or cold or hot, or following a schedule that you don’t wake up in the morning and think about whether or not you’re going to get up. The wake-up bell rings, and you get up. What drew me towards it is almost inexplicable. I hardly knew what it was when I first went down the road to see it. I had read Japanese and Chinese poems when I was in college. The first book I ever bought for myself was a book of haiku. I was drawn to that particular way of parsing the world. There was something in it that felt, to me, a gate I wanted to go through. And when I first went, I thought I would stay a few weeks. I had no idea I would stay for eight years.

ezra klein

How did staying for eight years change the way you apprehended today?

jane hirshfield

So completely, it is probably almost unnamable — not least, what luck for a person who was born into East 20th Street in New York City and had led an entirely urban life, what luck to be able to live in the wilderness with almost nothing between you and the actual world, some plastic windows and some wooden planks, to live in the fundamental way that human beings have lived, what we evolved into, by the light and dark that the world gives us, the experiment of being in a very small group of people that doesn’t change, because nobody would go in or out for at least three months at a time. It was so basically human. And, of course, what you work with is all the parts of you that go, I don’t want to do this. I’m tired. I don’t want to wake up. Oh, the bell rings. I get up. And it gives you a set of tools for being willing to give yourself over to an experience which is fundamentally tuned towards attending to what is and making the periphery and boundary of the self a little less important. You’re still there. You’re the one leading your own life. You’re the one who has to get up and put your robes on and go in the dark to the meditation hall and then sit there for many, many, many hours a day. But it also isn’t you. It is a monastic schedule that has been in place for 2,500 years. Does that begin to say anything about this? You have all the experiences. No one should assume that just because somebody is sitting on a meditation cushion, that that means they are coursing in what is called in Japanese Zen “samadhi” all the time. You’re thinking. You’re itching. You’re restless. Your knees hurt. Your back hurts. Your shoulder hurts. You’re hungry. You’re cold. You’re bored. You’re having the experiences of the day racing through you. But because you are staying on the meditation cushion, one thing you learn over all those days and weeks and months and years is that these experiences matter. They are the quality of your life. They are the substance of your life. And they also continually change. One thing comes, and eventually, it goes. Something else comes, and eventually, it goes. And some of that time, your mind is actually simply aware and permeable. And when the first bird of the morning begins singing, there is no separation between you and the bird. [MUSIC PLAYING]

ezra klein

You’ve said that the practices of poetry, of Zen, and of daily life feel, for you, continuous. Tell me about that in particular. You had the practice of daily life to that.

jane hirshfield

Well, they must be continuous. One of the things that I always liked about Zen training is it is recognized as a period of training. It’s not like Catholicism, where, if you go into a monastery, it’s considered a failure if you leave. In Zen, it is considered an opportunity to do one thing intensely enough to get it into your D.N.A., of your psyche, perhaps, get it into your body, get it into your emotional body, get it into your mind, feel it. What a luxury. It’s like one long Sabbath. I know you did a program on the Sabbath a couple of months ago. And time in a Zen monastery is Sabbath time. But the rest of the week also exists. And it was always very important to me that one of the models is, you go back into the world, and you look like a normal person. And you live the way everybody else lives. Because any knowledge which is only available under special circumstances is not the actuality of our human lives. And so all you’re doing in meditation is learning how to wash the dishes well. Neither is prior to the other in importance. If you cannot take what happens on the cushion and have it be present in all the rest of your life, what is it worth to you or to anyone else? And in Soto Zen, which is the school of Zen that all of my training was in, they don’t make such a big fuss about the special, big experiences. Because the only measure of the meaning of such a special, big experience is, how are you when you’re racing to the post office and you find there’s a long line? If it doesn’t affect that, what is the meaning of it? There’s no meaning to it. If it doesn’t affect your response to hearing that a war has started in Ukraine, what is the meaning of it? Such a practice only has meaning if it extends through your daily life and how you spend the hours and minutes and seconds of it when you’re lucky enough to be here spending them.

ezra klein

I’d like to have you read one more poem that brings together daily life and poetry, I think, in a very literal way, which is “Advice to Myself.”

jane hirshfield

So yeah. One of my odd specialties I discovered has been — I was an early adopter of writing about computer experience in poems. Things like autocorrect showed up very early in my poems compared to anything else that I was seeing. And this is such a poem. This is a poem of the computer as experience. “Advice to myself. The computer file of which I have no recollection is labeled ‘advice to myself.’ I click it open, look, scroll further down. The screen stays backlit and empty. Thus, I meet myself again, hopeful and useless, a mystery, precisely as I must have done on Aug. 19, 2010, 11:08 a.m.”

ezra klein

Let me ask you, what makes that a poem as opposed to simply a journal entry?

jane hirshfield

[LAUGHS] That’s up to you. For me, what makes it a poem, I suppose, is that I had an experience, and it tells the experience. And I think it’s a funny poem myself — somehow recognizing that this hope that we will find some wisdom somehow and, no, disappointed again. But I looked before, and I looked again now. It’s holding a little obsidian shard of the experience of being human in a way that I could write it down. And because it went into print, other people can read it. And they can laugh with me at all our hope and our uselessness at solving these questions. I had no advice for myself. But somehow, admitting that makes it enough of a poem that, for some reason, of all that you could have singled out from my work, you chose this one. So maybe I should ask you — if I’m allowed to — why did you pick this poem?

ezra klein

Well, two reasons. One is that I think it’s very funny. As you say, it is a very funny poem. The other is it gets at something that you said and that I think is a little lost. You said once that poems began as technology to store information and stories precisely, pre-writing. That task is still in their DNA, though other tasks have been added. And that got me thinking about the way that poetry was once the most practical of arts, a way of keeping oral traditions alive, a way of making things easier to remember, more compressed. And now, they’re understood as these abstractions, these indulgences, the little bits of fun. And I’m curious for you — because that poem, to me, walks the line in an interesting way — about how you understand that old, very practical form of poetry, the poetry of, this happened. And I don’t just want to remember it, I want to make it possible for you to remember it and then someone else to remember it and their children to remember it, and on and on and on, the poetry of an oral culture.

jane hirshfield

Yes. So poetry began as the way to hold things precisely in place before there was writing. Rhyme and meter — the best way for a person of our time and our life to feel this as if I say to you, how many days are there in May? And you begin reciting, 30 days hath September, April — you say a little rhyme that holds the information in place because it rhymes. And that was what all of the great epics and the lyric poems and the work song poems of the pre-literate world were doing. They were storing information in ways that it would stay in place and not be susceptible to the forces of the children’s game of telephone. Then, writing came along. I love — there’s a whole chapter in my book of essays, “Nine Gates,” about the birth of poetry and oral mind and then how it changed when literacy came along. So I’m passionate about this subject. Things got added. Once you had writing that was able to do the bookkeeping and the genealogy and the etiquette books about how to be a guest at someone’s house when you’re a traveler on the road, poetry was freed to expand to subtler things, more intimate things. Although, the epics hold it all. “The Iliad” and “The Odyssey” are full-range portraits of what it is to be human. “Gilgamesh,” the early Sumerian epic, holds the story of the discovery of death and how we will respond to it when we realize our own mortality, which is one of the great human questions. And I think the work of poetry now, it has never lost its job of holding something very difficult to hold in a pocketable form, a giveable form, something that can be transmitted, something that you can pull out yourself years later when you suddenly think what you need most in this world is to reread Auden’s “Musée des Beaux Arts” to understand how it is that our culture can ignore suffering as much as it does. But we have also, I think, as a tribe of art makers, I suppose, we have moved greatly into the area of — as I think of it myself, anyhow — poems exist to answer the questions that can’t be otherwise answered, these great deep questions of how to navigate a human life that are not susceptible to medicine or engineering or any of the technologies of the practical world. So poems augment — if you’re just hungry and you want dinner, you’ll go to the grocery store, or you’ll pull out a cookbook. And you’ll make a recipe using whatever you’ve got in the refrigerator. But if you suddenly want to understand hunger — what does it mean to be hungry, what does it mean to be fed when other people are hungry — for that, you need poems. Poems respond to questions that have no answer that’s ever going to stay fixed or set. And yet, the questions will keep returning. And you’ll either go back to the same poem, or you will look for a new one, or you will write a new one. Because you’re haunted. That is why we will never have — the world is full of great love poems, but there will always be room for new love poems. The world is full of poems of mourning, but we will always write new poems of mourning. Because there is no one answer. There is no one set of words which says, oh, this is how you do it. This is how — when your beloved has died, how you managed to open your eyes the next morning.

ezra klein

It makes me think of how we have this cliché of teenagers writing their bad poetry, how poetry is very important to — I didn’t really write much poetry as a teenager, but poetry is very important to people when they’re young and trying to figure out their life. And in my day, you wrote it on your LiveJournal, and it was very emotional. And then it also has this sort of high art dimension, right? You become a poet. And that’s a very rarified thing to be. And that that middle has kind of been chopped out of it. I remember talking to Jeff Tweedy on the show, the lead of Wilco. And he talked about his father, who would get mad and stomp down to the basement and write angry poems when he was upset and then come and read them to the family. And I found that extremely moving, that kind of mundane, daily use for poetry in a life. And so I’m curious — I’d like to end on this question about that, about how to use something that has its origins as being so practical, that is still so widely done by so many of us when we’re young. How do you understand how distant poetry begins to feel for a lot of us as we become adults — either too remote, or not something we can do, or not something we’re good enough at it to do, or not something we can understand — how do you think about that gap that opens up between people and poems?

jane hirshfield

Well, one thing to start with — I have a theory, because I have seen it in my friends. There are an awful lot of people who never read poetry, never write poetry. But something large happens in their life, and they write something. And because I’m the person who write poems who they happen to know, they show it to me. And sometimes, it is a great poem. It’s not bad at all. It’s quite great. And so I have come up with this rule of thumb that every person has three great poems in them. They just might not know, even when they’ve written one. So this is a universal gift. It is not for the specialized. Just as everybody sings — even people who can’t carry a tune, when they’re alone in the car or the shower, they will sing — it is the inheritance of all of us, as all of the arts are, to draw or to dance or to sing or to drum. We are artmaking creatures. And there shouldn’t be an enormous division between one person’s making and another. It is quite continuous. I do think that for — and, of course, you’re right. For some reason, this is very prevalent in the teen years. As you are learning to navigate the longings and disappointments of Eros, particularly, poetry does tend to step forward at that time. Although, I also, when I was, I think — I don’t know, 12 or 14 — I was writing really angry poems about the Vietnam War, ranting poems about the Vietnam War. So I was a poet interested in the political even then, it seems. But we, mostly now — if you want to know where that great central Mississippi River of poetry went, it went into song lyrics. And every song that has words, those words are a poem. We call it lyric poetry because it began as an art, as words that were sung to the lyre. And so poetry is alive and well and flourishing. Because everybody’s either singing songs that they’ve heard or making up their own quite nicely. And poems have many kinds of work they do in the world. And one of the kinds of work that they do — they bring people together, say, work songs or, alas, war songs. They also honor moments of transition and carry you across a moment when your life is changing. And the one place where you will almost always hear a poem now is a wedding or a funeral. And I’ve always thought, as long as poems are being given at weddings and funerals, the art is fine. Because it is there to serve people when they want words that will help them through these unanswerable, unnavigable moments. And part of that is simply knowing you are not alone in your experience. Whatever it is you experience, someone has been there before, found language to hold, and survived it. The poem is the evidence of the survival. And that brings great comfort to us at the moments we’re not sure that we can survive what has been asked of us. And I love humility. I have come to really value this as a quality that helps me get through the day. Given our current world, where almost every day, you turn on the news, and it’s devastating. Even now, it never stops being devastating. I thought it was going to quiet down, and it hasn’t. And for me, one of the great uses of poetry and one of the great needs for poetry is an antidote to despair. I am susceptible to despair. But I know it serves no one. And so I’m always looking for antidotes to despair. And poems are a terrific antidote to despair. Because no matter what is happening in your life or the world’s life, if you can write words to have a conversation with what you feel about this, what you see, even your own impotence, even your own I have nothing here, if you can say that in words that are new and different and distinctive and only that moment’s language, you do have agency. You change the world and yourself by changing your thoughts. And first, you change yourself. And then maybe you change the world. And then maybe you help somebody else in their moment of great despair — or their moment of great joy.

ezra klein

I think that’s a beautiful place to end. So always our final question, what are three books that you would recommend to the audience?

jane hirshfield

OK. This is a strange range of books in that I’m not giving you any poetry books at all. I’m giving you other things. One is a book called “Metaphors We Live By” by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson. And reading that book completely changed my understanding of language because it shows you how everything we say has its tap roots in the embodied world and how all of our structures of mind and biases of mind are reflections of our first experience of the world of embodied interbeing that we are part of. So one example for that is, why is it so hard for human beings to not be pro-growth, even in an age where we understand that unmitigated growth is not going to be good for the planet, people or its other beings? Well, we were born into awareness of life is what comes up from the ground and gets larger, and that is what feeds us and shades us and gives us a place to live and creates flowers and all of that. And death is what stops growing and gets smaller. And so the bias towards “growth is good” is incredibly powerful in us. And I feel more sympathetic for the difficulty we have dealing with our current problems when I am aware of the fact of how deeply entrenched in our language and our conceptual minds these fundamental things are. So “Metaphors We Live By”— it’s also a good book for understanding how poetry works, but it’s much more a good book for understanding how we work, why our thinking is what it is. This next one is going to seem kind of arcane, I imagine. So the Russian poet Joseph Brodsky has a book of essays, “Less Than One.” And one long chapter in that essay is a close reading of the poem “September 1, 1939” by Auden, one of the great public poems of the age. And as I often tell my students, there is an entire graduate course in how to read poetry in that one essay. If you read “September 1, 1939” in “Less than One,” you will know how to read poems. You will know what goes into reading poems. The next one, just because I reread it and felt it was indispensable and invaluable and has not been surpassed for its clarity of seeing combined with an absolute commitment to affection for our fellow human beings, James Baldwin, “The Fire Next Time.”

“Kelly has been a fierce advocate for the vitality of broadcast television while being a steady and respected network leader through the good times as well as turbulent periods,” George Cheeks, the chief executive of CBS, said in an email to employees Wednesday."

Thank you very much and on behalf of Melania, myself and our entire family, I want to thank you all for being here tonight. It’s a very special occasion at a very special place. You and all of those watching are the heart and soul of this incredible movement, the greatest country in the history of the world. It’s very simple. There’s never been anything like it, this great movement of ours. Never been anything like it, And perhaps there will never be anything like it again. There’s never been anything to compete with what we have all done.

Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests, and my fellow citizens, America’s comeback starts right now — America’s comeback starts right now.

Two years ago, when I left office, the United States stood ready for its golden age. Our nation was at the pinnacle of power, prosperity and prestige, towering above all rivals, vanquishing all enemies and striding into the future confident and so strong.

In four short years, everybody was doing great: men, women, African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, everybody was thriving like never before.

There was never a time like this. We turned the page on decades of globalists, sellouts and one-sided trade deals. Lifted millions out of poverty and together we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. When the virus hit our shores, I took decisive action and saved lives and the U.S. economy. And by October of the same year, America was roaring back with the No. 1 fastest economic recovery ever recorded. How about that?

All of the incoming administration and all they had to do was just sit back and watch. Inflation was nonexistent. Our southern border was by far the strongest ever. And because the border was so tight, drugs were coming into our country at the lowest level in many, many years. Importantly, after decades of rising energy costs, the United States had finally obtained the impossible dream of American energy independence, which soon would have turned into energy dominance.

For the first time in memory, China was reeling and back on its heels. I had never seen that before, because the United States was outdoing them on every single front and China was paying billions and billions of dollars on taxes and tariffs. The farmers know that because they got 28 billion of it. No president had ever sought or received one dollar for our country from China until I came along and we were getting hundreds of billions of dollars. Many people think that because of this, China played a very active role in the 2020 election. Just saying. Just saying. I am sure that didn’t happen. Instead of jobs in factories leaving America for China, they were for the first time ever leaving China for America.

Businesses were pouring back because of our historic tax and regulation cuts, the biggest in both categories in history, bigger even than what Ronald Reagan was able to produce, and he produced a lot. China, Russia, Iran and North Korea were in check. Respected. They respected the United States. And quite honestly, they respected me. I knew them well. I knew them well.

The vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors. In less than three weeks, al-Baghdadi, its founder, was hunted down and killed. North Korea had not launched a single long-range missile since my summit with chairman Kim Jong-un, nearly three years before we developed a relationship. And that's a good thing, not a bad thing. It's a good thing. Very good thing, actually. Because look at what is happening today. My opponents made me out to be a warmonger and just a terrible person who would immediately go into war. They said during the 2016 campaign that if he becomes president, there will never be a war within weeks. We will have wars like you've never seen before. It will happen immediately. And yet, I have gone decades, decades, without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.

The world was at peace, America was prospering, and our country was on track for an amazing future, because I made big promises to the American people, and unlike other presidents, I kept my promises. I kept them.

Thank you very much. Under our leadership, we were a great and glorious nation, something you haven’t heard for quite a long period of time. We were a strong nation and importantly, we were a free nation. But now we are a nation in decline. We are a failing nation. For millions of Americans, the past two years under Joe Biden have been a time of pain, hardship, anxiety and despair. As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years. Gas prices have reached the highest levels in history and expect them to go much higher, now that the strategic national reserves, which I filled up, have been virtually drained in order to keep gasoline prices lower, just prior to the election. Joe Biden has intentionally surrendered our energy independence. There is no longer even a thought of dominance, and we are now begging for energy help from foreign nations, many of whom find us detestable. Our southern border has been erased and our country is being invaded by millions and millions of unknown people, many of whom are entering for a very bad and sinister reason.

And you know what that reason is. We will be paying a big price for this invasion in our country for years to come. Hundreds of thousands of pounds of deadly drugs, including very lethal fentanyl, are flooding across the now open and totally porous southern border. The bloodsoaked streets of our once great cities are cesspools of violent crimes, which are being watched all over the world, as leadership of other countries explain that this is what America and democracy is really all about. How sad. The United States has been embarrassed, humiliated and weakened for all to see. The disasters in Afghanistan, perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind, and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world.

And Ukraine, which would have never happened if I were your president – are something —

And even the Democrats admit that. That's something I have seen them admit over and over again. But our enemies are speaking of us with scorn and laughter and derision because of those two events. But there are many more, even just today, a missile was sent in probably by Russia, to Poland, 50 miles into Poland. And people are going absolutely wild and crazy and they are not happy. They are very, very angry.

Now we have a president who falls asleep at global conferences. Was held in contempt by the British Parliament over Afghanistan. Thanks to the words of wisdom, he said thank you to the wrong country for inviting him to a major summit on the environment, of all things.

They fly for days to get there and then he calls the country a name that was actually a country on another continent. He is leading us to the brink of nuclear war, a concept unimaginable just two short years ago. You cannot mention the nuclear word. It is too devastating. The Green New Deal and the environment, which they say may affect us in 300 years is all that is talked about. And yet nuclear weapons, which would destroy the world immediately, are never even discussed as a major threat. Can you imagine? They say the ocean will rise one-eighth of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot. Something is wrong with their thinking. Under Biden and the radical Democrats, America has been mocked, derided and brought to its knees, perhaps like never before.

But we are here tonight to declare that it does not have to be this way. It does not have to be this way.

Two years ago, we were a great nation and soon, we will be a great nation again.

The decline of America is being forced upon us by Biden and the radical left lunatics running our government right into the ground. This decline is not a fate we must accept. When given the choice, boldly, clearly and directly, I believe the American people will overwhelmingly reject the left’s platform of national ruin. And they will embrace our platform of national greatness and glory to America, glory.

Exactly one week ago, our citizens voted in the important midterm elections. Despite a ridiculously long and unnecessary period of waiting, far longer in fact than any third-world country, just a short time ago, the Republicans won back control of the House of Representatives.

And it was with a great Trump-endorsed candidate, Congressman-elect Kevin Kiley, who was a fantastic person, a fantastic person.

And I am very happy it was his vote that did it. So we now won back — this happened just an hour ago. Much criticism is being placed on the fact that the Republican Party should have done better. And frankly, much of this blame is correct. But the citizens of our country have not yet realized the full extent and gravity of the pain our nation is going through. And the total effect of the suffering is just starting to take hold. They don’t quite feel it yet, but they will very soon. I have no doubt that by 2024, it will sadly be much worse and they will see much more clearly what happened and what is happening to our country and the voting will be much different. 2024.

Are you getting ready?

And I am, too. I am, too. I do want to point out that in the midterms, my endorsement success rate was 232 wins and only 22 losses. You don't hear that from the media.

This is an elegant night and an elegant press place. And I am not going to use the term “fake news media.” So we are going to keep it very elegant, but you don't hear that from the media. But I think you will because people are starting to see what happened.

That score, in the primaries, it was 98.6 percent. But they were still trying to blame me. And the reason for the success and that unprecedented success rate is that the Trump administration changed our nation on trade, on securing the border with the strongest safest border ever in the history of our country, on Islamic terrorism, we had practically just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks during the Trump administration. In fact, we got along well with the various countries.

Including coming up with the Abraham accords. It’s a great thing. But it is because of cutting taxes and regulations at the highest level ever and building the greatest economy. Any time in the history of the world, there has never been an economy like we had just two years ago. Despite the outcome in the Senate, we cannot lose hope and we must all work very hard for a gentleman and a great person named Herschel Walker, a fabulous human being, who loves our country and will be a great United States senator. Herschel Walker.

Get out and vote for Herschel. He deserves it. He was an incredible athlete. He’ll be an even better senator. Get out and vote for Herschel Walker. We elected a group of incredibly talented America First leaders who will be stars of our party for many years to come. In the popular vote, another thing that’s not discussed for the House, we must remember that Republicans won five million more votes, the largest margin in many, many years over the Democrats, five million more votes. That’s a big thing. Breaking the radical Democrats’ grip on Congress was crucial. So in other words, because of our great congressman and all of our great congressmen and congresswomen, we have taken over Congress. Nancy Pelosi has been fired.

I told them, I said, “If you just keep a little bit lower standard, you are going to have a big victory.” They said let's win by 40 seats, let’s win by 50. I said, “If you win by two seats, be happy.” But she's on her way to another country right now. She’s been fired.

But we always had known that this was not the end. It was only the beginning of our fight to rescue the American dream. And it's a word you don't use, it's two words, I don't want to be Joe. It’s two words: American dream. That was not good what he did, a lot of bad things. Like going to Idaho and saying welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it. In order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for president of the United States.

Thank you, all of you. So many incredible friends and family here tonight. It’s such a beautiful thing. Some people say, “How do you speak before so many people all the time?” When there is love in the room, it is really easy. You ought to try it sometime. Together, we will be taking on the most corrupt forces and entrenched interests imaginable. Our country is in a horrible state. We are in grave trouble. This is not a task for a politician or conventional candidate. This is a task for a great movement that embodies the courage, confidence and the spirit of the American people. This is a movement, this is not for any one individual. This is a job for tens of millions of proud people working together from all across the land and from all walks of life: young and old, Black and white, Hispanic and Asian, many of whom we have brought together for the very, very first time.

If you look at the numbers, if you look at what’s happened with Hispanic, with African American, with Asian, just look at what’s happening, this is a party that has become much bigger, much stronger, much more powerful, can do much more good for our country. This is a job for grandmothers and construction workers, firefighters, builders, teachers, doctors and farmers who cannot stay quiet any longer. You cannot stay quiet any longer. You’re angry about what is happening to our country. Our country is being destroyed before your very eyes.

It’s a job for every aspiring young person and every hard-working parent, for every entrepreneur and underappreciated police officer who was ready to shout for safety in America. The police are being treated so badly. These are great people that can straighten out the crime. They are the ones who know how to do it. We have to give them back their respect and dignity.

This will not be my campaign. This will be our campaign, all together.

Because the only force strong enough to defeat the massive corruption we are up against is you, the American people. It’s true. The American people, the greatest people on earth. We love them all, we love both sides. We are going to bring people together. We are going to unify people. And it was happening in the previous administration, and what was bringing them together was success. Prior to Covid coming in, the people were calling me, that were calling me, you wouldn’t believe it. People that were so far left, I figured they would never speak to me and I would never speak to them, but our success was so incredible, like never before. And then Covid started coming in from China. We call it the China virus. Some people call it other things. But it was devastating, and we built it back and did an incredible job. But when people say Republicans or Democrats or liberals or conservatives, I say we can get together. And we were doing that. That was happening just prior.

Because the success was greater than this country has ever had. We were leapfrogging China and leapfrogging everyone else and everyone wanted a piece of it. But just as I promised in 2016, I am your voice. I am your voice.

The Washington establishment wants to silence us, but we will not let them do that. What we have built together over the past six years is the greatest movement in history because it is not about politics, it’s about our love for this great country, America. And we’re not going to let it fail. I am running because I believe the world has not yet seen the true glory of what this nation can be. We have not reached that pinnacle, believe it or not. In fact, we can go very far.

We’re going to have to go far. First we have to get out of this ditch. Once we are out, you will see things that nobody has imagined for any country. It’s called the United States of America. It’s an incredible place.

We are Americans, and we do not have to endure what has taken place in Washington, D.C. This is our country, our government. And the corridors of power, they are our corridors. They are not their corridors, these are our corridors. We are coming to take those corridors back.

From now on until Election Day in 2024 — which will come very quickly, we will go, “Look at how time flies. Look at how fast it is all going,” — I will fight like no one has ever fought before. We will defeat the radical left Democrats that are trying to destroy our country from within. And likewise protect us all, we want to protect us. We have to be protected from all of those nations out there that are looking to destroy us from beyond our shores. There are lots of nations that hate us, gravely. And that’s the problem.

When they look at us in disarray like we are now, when we go to them begging for oil and we have more liquid gold under our feet than they have, or any other nation has, and we don’t use it because we’re going to them? It's crazy what is happening. We can’t let it continue. Joe Biden is the face of left-wing failure and Washington corruption.

He had a big G20 dinner tonight. Everyone flew over to wherever they flew over. And guess what? He never showed up. They're still looking for him. What’s going on?

G20, I used to love that. The leaders, I used to make deals for our country like you wouldn’t believe. It was one, give me the next one, give me the next one. We got them to stop taking advantage of our country. Every nation took advantage of our country. We renegotiated deals with Mexico and Canada, USMCA, we got rid of the worst trade deal ever made. Ever made. NAFTA, the worst trade deal ever made. That is why the farmers love Trump. Because we did a great job. The manufacturers also. We did a deal, we restructured our terrible deal – terrible deal – with Japan. I did it with Prime Minister Abe, a great man, who, unfortunately, it’s so sad, he was a great friend of mine, great man, loved his country so much. We restructured and made it a really terrific deal. With South Korea and other countries.

The best of all is what we did with China. We made an incredible deal. But after Covid, I don't even bother talking about it, because the devastation that it caused the entire world was too much to bear. I will ensure that Joe Biden does not receive four more years in 2020. Can’t do it.

Our country could not take that. I say that not in laughter, I say that in tears. Our country could not take four more years. It can only take so much. It’s all very fragile to start off with. It can only take so much. In 2020, I received the largest number of votes of any sitting president in history. By a lot. And we will do it again, but with even more votes this time.

Many have noted the huge gains we have made with Latino voters. And I believe we will set even greater records with this crucial vote in 2024.

The Hispanic voter, the Latino voter, has been unbelievable. Great people. Very entrepreneurial people. And they want security. Everyone thought when I did the wall, when I built the wall, they thought it would hurt me with the Hispanic vote. No, it helped me because they understood. They wanted safety. They wanted security. They understood the border better than anybody else. So they were amazed that we started that trend and now we are continuing with that trend. Look at what we have done in Florida and what everybody is now doing in Florida. In Texas, along the border in Texas, won every single community. I won every single community.

The governor of Texas called, great gentlemen just got re-elected. He said to me, “I would like to talk to you for a second. I said you've done something no one else has done. You’ve won every single area along the border. The longest since Reconstruction.” I said, “Reconstruction? I guess you call that the Civil War.” That’s what I call it. That’s what I call it.

Governor Abbott, very good man. It's horrible because what is happening is they are sending hundreds of thousands of people right through his state, right through Arizona, right through all of the states. What is happening is they are coming up all of the states. And we can’t have it anymore. This campaign will be about issues, vision and success and we will not stop. We will not quit until we achieve the highest goals and make our country greater than it has ever been before. We can do that. We can do it.

Our victory will be built upon big ideas, bold ambitions and daring dreams for America’s future. We need daring dreams, it is not enough merely to complain or oppose. We don't want to be critics, we don’t want to be complainers. I never wanted to be a critic. I never respected critics. They tell people what is wrong but they can't do it themselves. We will win, because we will fight with every measure of our strength, with every ounce of our energy, to lift up the working men and the working women of America and restore the fabric of this nation. The radical left Democrats have embraced an extreme ideology of government domination and control. Our approach is the opposite: one based on freedom, values, individual responsibility, and just plain common sense. It’s common sense.

In two years, the Biden administration has destroyed the U.S. economy. Just destroyed it. With victory, we will again build the greatest economy ever. It'll take place quickly. We will build the greatest economy ever. And if you remember, I did it twice. I did it before Covid and handed off something where the stock market was higher than just prior to Covid coming in.

And we did it twice and we will do it again, but this time we will do it bigger, stronger, better than anybody could ever imagine.

One of the beautiful things of the polls, if there is such a thing, a beautiful thing, one of the important factors of the polls, is that we see how bad they’ve done. We will be able to do it properly and it will be much easier. Everybody will agree with us because everybody sees what a bad job that has been done during this two-year period and it will be a four-year period. Everybody sees that. It will be much easier for us to do what has to be done.

We will immediately tackle inflation and bring down to a level that it was. You know we were at zero, but actually the best number is 1 percent, you know that. You don’t want it really zero. But we were at zero. We got to exactly 1 percent, the perfect number, one thing every economist agrees, don’t have it at zero, have it at, like, 1 percent. They even say 1 to 2. But I said, “Listen, do 1.” We had it at 1 percent and we had it there for a long period of time. And we had the value of the dollar, we had it so that this country could make a lot of money. And I fought other countries where they devalued their dollar, they devalued their currency. Whether it was the pound, whether it was the yuan or the yen. And I used to fight like cats and dogs with the leaders of other countries because they were stealing from us when they did that, they had artificial devaluations of their currency. It's a very important thing. I haven’t even heard it mentioned in two years. It’s a very important thing. It's very hard for us to compete when they do that artificially. They had to pay a big price when they did it. They never really did it for very long. I said we’re not going to do business with you any more as a country. They believed me. They let it go back up.

Instead of putting America last, as the Biden administration has done very, very openly and bravely, because I can’t imagine saying, “Let's put America last” — I think it takes courage – we will again put America first. Every policy.

Thank you very much. We do love our country. That's why we are here. I didn’t need this. I had a very nice, easy life. This is something I didn’t need. A lot of you people don’t need either. But we love our country, we have to take care of our country, we have to save our country.

Every policy must be geared toward that which supports the American worker, the American family and businesses, both large and small, and allows our country to compete with other nations on a very level playing field, which we never had until I came along and the Trump administration came along. And now we are losing it. They are moving back into China, they are moving back into other countries. It's horrible. That means low taxes, low regulations and fair trade. Much of which I’ve already completed, but now will even greatly enhance.

Other countries should pay for the privilege of coming into the American marketplace. They have to pay to come into our country and make all of that money, take it away from us. Thanks to the Trump administration, still the best and biggest country in the world is what we have. We have the best and biggest. If you remember, for many years, you can look in your projection books, China was going to take over from us as the largest economy in the world in 2018 or 2019. I said I don’t like that timing.

I was with President Xi, who is now president for life. I call him king. He said “No, no, I am not the king.” I said, “Yes, you are the king, you’re president for life, that's the same thing.”

But I said, “President, President, you can’t do these things.” Remember they had China 25? That means China was going to take over virtually the whole world economy by ‘25. I said that’s not a nice sign, I don’t want that sign. They took it down, they took down the whole slogan. It will probably be coming back in the near future. But I found it very insulting. I said, “I find that very insulting.”

On Day 1, we will end Joe Biden’s war on American energy. You will see when that happens, you will see energy costs come down. Because energy is so big and important, you will see inflation dropping, dropping, dropping. You will see it come down. It’s a thing of beauty. You wouldn’t think it’s that complicated. What has been complicated a little bit is what has happened with so many other things, I believe originally started by this energy disaster. We were $1.87 for gasoline, now it is hitting $5, $6, $7 and even $8 and it’s going to go really bad. The socialist disaster known as the Green New Deal, which is destroying our country, and the many crippling regulations that it has spawned, will be immediately terminated so our country can again breathe and grow and thrive like it should.

It’s very very much hurting our country. Germany tried it.You know, Germany tried it. They were up for about a year. Remember, I said to Angela, do you remember Angela? Do you remember Angela? Nobody is remembering her now. Angela Merkel. I sent her a white flag of surrender. She said, “But why do you send this to me, Donald?” I said, “Angela, I sent it to you because this is a flag of surrender, you're getting 78 percent of your energy from Russia.” When that happens, history has proven that it’s not good for Germany. Just take a look over the last 150 years, it hasn’t been good.

What I didn’t know is it would take place so fast. Germany closed, as you know, all of its coal plants, all of its nuclear power plants, they closed everything. Now they’re building coal plants and they’re building them fast. China's building a coal plant every week. Every week, they open up another. They talk about all of the things that they do environmentally. They are watching us die with the Green New Deal, with our windmills and solar that doesn’t have the power to fire up our great factories and great plants. They are watching us die and they are laughing as it happens. Remember, economic security is national security. That’s what it is. We need economic security.

That is why we will launch an all-out campaign to eliminate America’s dependence on China. We will bring our supply chains, which are a disaster right now, you can't get anything, and good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. No. 1, won't get it, and if you do, you will pay three to four times more than you paid last year. We will bring our supply chains and manufacturing base back home, as we were strongly doing during the Trump administration. We will systematically bring back health, wealth and success to the American middle class and to America itself.

Please, sit down.

I feel so guilty having you stand. You’ve been standing for the whole event. I feel very guilty. I don't want that to happen.

To every worker and family struggling to survive in the Biden economy with inflation destroying your family and your life, this campaign will be for you. Help is on the way. Joe Biden has abolished America's borders. We are going to restore and secure America's borders just like we had them before. Best ever. We built the wall and now we will add to it. Now we built the wall, we completed the wall and then we said, “Let's do more,” and we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would have been great. And they said, no, no, we are not going to do that. That is when I realized that they actually want to have this disaster known as open borders. Hard to believe, isn’t it.

But one of the reasons we had so much success at the border was because of the fact that — two things. We got Mexico to give us free of charge 28,000 soldiers. That helps. The president of Mexico is a great gentleman by the way, a socialist but that is OK. You can't have everything. But he is a great man and a great friend of mine. Twenty-eight thousand soldiers while we were building the wall. And then when the wall was finished, that’s how we set all these records, we have records that no one can even compete with right now. It's a disaster. I believe it's 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people, they’re pouring into our country. We have no idea who they are and where they come from. We have no idea what’s happening to our country. We are being poisoned. Within moments of my inauguration, catch and release will be gone forever. Remain in Mexico —

— Remain in Mexico, which was so important. Everybody came in here and they remained here and never left. If you couldn't get them, you couldn't find them. I had a policy, remain in Mexico. And if you think it was easy for me to get the president of Mexico to agree to that, it wasn't but we got it. And they terminated it. Now they come here and stay and we have no idea where they are, and they get lost. It's very dangerous for our country. And again, I’ll say: We are going to pay a big price someday for what they are doing. We will begin the process of safely removing the illegal alien criminals that have been unlawfully allowed into our country. We have no choice. We have no choice.

And in restoring border security, we will stop the flow of deadly drugs and horrible human trafficking, which both have been set upon us like never before. The human trafficking, you think of it as an ancient thing. It’s not ancient, because of the internet, human trafficking is worse than it’s ever been in history. We stop them at the southern border, which is the No. 1 port all over the world, the southern border. So much comes through the southern border. No. 1 port and we stopped them. Now, it's at levels that are many, many times what it was just two years ago. Biden and the radical left have let loose on this total breakdown of law and order. It was a total breakdown of law and order. I will restore public safety and American cities and other communities that need our help. If they don't want our help, we’re going to insist that they take our help this time. Because you know, the Democrat governors, these are all Democrat cities, the governors and mayors are supposed to ask for the help, they would never ask for help. And yet people are being shot and killed at random, like nobody has ever seen before. And we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and other places. In Seattle, we went and we were getting ready to go and they took over part of the city. The governors, the Democrats don’t want to ever ask to do anything because they don’t want to shake things up. In the meantime, the cities are rotting. They are indeed cesspools of blood. So we’re going to go help them, even though they don't want our help. We will give our police back their authority, resources, power, legal protection, and we will give them back their respect. They’re great people. I will immediately launch a no-holds barred national campaign to dismantle the gangs and clean out the nests of organized street crime.

The worst criminals, the worst gangs are MS-13, under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out because the countries where they came from wouldn’t take them. And I learned about that. My first day, I should say. And I learned about it and I said, “Which countries?” And it was Honduras, Guatemala, it was El Salvador, some others. And I said, “How much do we pay them?” “Sir, you pay them $750 million a year. That’s a lot of money.” I said, all right, stop payment. We're not paying them anymore. Because they wouldn't accept them. They would put planes on the runway so when our plane would come out with these gang members from MS-13, the plane couldn’t land because other planes were on the runway. The buses weren’t allowed to get through their borders because they had stronger borders than we did by far. We don't have borders, they did. Other countries that we defend have borders. We defend other countries' borders but we don’t defend our own. These countries — I got to know all of the presidents, prime ministers. I got to know them all. I said, all right, stop payment of the $750 million a year. They would not take them. You cannot get anybody back in. They didn't just come out, they sent them out. They want to keep their good ones. They don't want the bad ones. These are gang members that will kill, and they like using knives because a knife is more painful than a gun. You’ve read the stories. MS-13, these are savages. They say, “Please do not use that name, they are people.” I say, “No, they are savages.” And so we went along and I said stop payment of the $750 million and I get a call the next morning from the presidents of every country that we are talking about.

“Sir, there seems to be a misunderstanding, what is the problem? Is there anything we can do?”

“Yeah, you're not taking your MS-13 gang members back that you sent to us in the caravans.”

I love the name, I came up with it. I love the name, the caravans, thousands and thousands of people. And in those caravans you have rough, rough people. I said, “You are not taking them back.”

“Well, we didn't know this was a problem, sir. Is there anything we could do?”

I said, “Yeah, take them back.”

“We would be glad to take them back.”

They took ’em back. I still didn't give them the 750. By the way, now Biden wants to give them $4 billion. They were happy with 750 and now they want to give them $4 billion. Somebody, someday is going to explain that one to me. It actually makes you rage with anger when you hear that. They wanted 750 so badly and now they're getting $4 billion. We will wage war upon the cartels and stop the fentanyl and deadly drugs from killing 200,000 Americans per year.

And I will ask Congress for legislation ensuring that drug dealers and human traffickers, these are terrible, terrible, horrible, people who are responsible for death, carnage and crime all over our country. Every drug dealer during his or her life on average will kill 500 people with the drugs they sell, not to mention the destruction of families. But we’re going to be asking everyone who sells drugs, gets caught selling drugs, to receive the death penalty for their heinous acts. Because it’s the only way. We don’t need any more blue-ribbon committees. I don’t like to say this. I don’t even know if the American public is ready for it. A lot of my people say, please don't say that, sir. That’s not nice.

They kill 500 people each on average. If you don't do this, in China, when I was with President Xi, I said, “President, do you have a drug problem?” No, no, no, we don't. He looked at me like I didn't know what I was doing. He said, “No we don't have a drug” — how come you don't have a drug problem?

He said quick trial. “What is a quick trial?” I sort of knew. “What is a quick trial?” That’s where if you get caught dealing drugs, you have an immediate and quick trial. And by the end of the day, you're executed. That’s a terrible thing but they have no drug problem.

The only drug problem they have is they make the fentanyl that comes into our country, and I had him stopping it. Then, when I was gone, no one mentioned it to him again. We were stopping it. That was way down, that number, but they send it in. But they don't have a drug problem. Other countries like Singapore – has no drug problem, no drug — you ask them, they don't even know what you're talking about, when you say drug problem, they don't even know what you’re talking about, they have no drug problem.

Why should they sell there and risk their lives every time they sell, when they can come to the United States and nobody even cares. They can do whatever they want to do and become rich. It's a disgrace. If you want to get rid of that and also bring down your level of crime probably 75, 80 percent, that is the only answer. No more blue-ribbon — I refuse to create them anymore, it was just a joke, it was New York people wanting to be on a committee for publicity reasons, no more blue-ribbon committees. That’s the only way you’re going to solve the problem. I hope politicians are listening because they should do it quickly. Joe Biden has also proven he is committed to indoctrinating our children, even using the Department of Justice against parents who object. It's a terrible thing. It's so sad what’s happening. When I am in the White House, our schools will cease pushing critical race theory as they were.

Radical civics and gender insanity, or if they do that, they will lose all federal funding. But we’ll get them to stop. I will be the president who finally fixes education in America. We were doing great. We were starting to really get it right. We will not let men, as an example, participate in women's sports. Is that OK? No men. No men.

My people tell me, “Sir, that’s politically incorrect to say.” I said, “That's OK. I’ll say it anyway if you don't mind.” We’ve had tremendous, tremendous problems and you know, it is very unfair to women, just very, very unfair. We will defend the rights of parents and we will defend the family as the center of American life.

But who would think, standing up here, 10 years ago, 15 years ago, that a politician, and I don't like to think of myself as a politician, but I guess that’s what I am. I hate that thought. But that a politician would be up saying, We will defend parental rights. Of course we would defend — who would think we would even have to mention this? Who would think it should even be a subject to be talked about? We have to defend parental rights, can you believe this? As commander in chief, I will get Biden’s radical left ideology out of our military. And I did, I did.

And the first day, they put it back. The first day, they signed an executive order and they put it back. It was gone. We will abolish every Biden Covid mandate and rehire every patriot who was fired from our military, with an apology and full back pay.

Thank you. And they deserve an apology. And they deserve full back pay and they’ll get it. And unlike Biden possibly getting us into World War III, which can seriously happen, I will keep America out of foolish and unnecessary foreign wars, just as I did for four straight years.

We will again have peace through strength. That is all it is. As events overseas have shown, to protect our people from the unthinkable threat of nuclear weapons and hypersonic missiles, the United States must also build a state-of-the-art, next-generation missile defense shield. We need it. The power of these missiles and the power of a word I refuse to say: nuclear. We have to have it. We need a defense shield. We have to do it. We actually have the technology and we’re going to build it. Just as I rebuilt our military, I will get this done.

I rebuilt our entire military, which nobody talks about. When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old. We had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber, but not anymore. But as I've said before, the gravest threats to our civilization are not from abroad but from within. None is greater than the weaponization of the justice system, the F.B.I. and the D.O.J. We must conduct a top to bottom overhaul to clean out the festering rot and corruption of Washington, D.C.

Thank you. And I’m a victim, I will tell you. I’m a victim. Think of it. The F.B.I. offered $1 million to Christopher Steele, who wrote the fake dossier, if he will lie and say that the fake dossier was true. And he refused to do it, so it had to be really fake. And then they hired somebody, Danchenko, for $200,000 a year, to focus on Trump and to get Trump and other things, including the raid of a very beautiful house that sits right here. The raid of Mar-a-Lago, think of it. And I say, “Why didn’t you raid Bush’s place, why didn’t you raid Clinton? 32,000 emails. Why didn’t you raid Clinton’s place? Why didn’t you do Obama, who took a lot of things with him?”

We will dismantle the deep state and restore government by the people. To further drain the swamp, I will push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on members of Congress, it’s time. And I will ask for a permanent ban on taxpayer funding of campaigns. A lifetime ban on lobbying by former members of Congress and cabinet members.

No, I see what they make, they leave the White House or they leave Congress and they’re paid millions and millions and millions of dollars a year. No, you have to have a ban. We want a ban on members of Congress getting rich by trading stocks with insider information. And many of our great members agree with that. They actually agree with that, and of course, we will do whatever it takes to bring back honesty, confidence and trust in our elections.

To eliminate cheating, I will immediately demand voter ID, same-day voting and only paper ballots. Only paper ballots.

France just had an election — 36 million people voted. It was all done by 10 o’clock in the evening, no complaints. You had a winner, you had a loser, the loser went home. The winner, he’s a friend of mine, nice guy, but he was happy. But there was no complaints. And if there was a complaint, you check it out and you can fix it very easily, you can find out what’s going on. No, paper ballots, same-day voting, voter ID, so simple. And we want all votes counted by election night.

They spent all of the money for machines and all of the stuff and they end up two weeks later, three weeks later, by that time, everyone forgot there was even an election. It’s horrible. This doesn’t happen, I’ve said it before, it doesn't happen in third-world countries, they do better than we do. It's horrible what’s happening with our election and our election process. And I’ll get that job done. That’s a personal job for me. I take that very personally. But this is just the beginning of our national greatness agenda. And that’s what we call it: a national greatness agenda.

Because our country can be greater than it ever was. Our country was great. Our country is not great anymore. Our country is a laughingstock right now, but our country can be greater than it ever was before, by a lot. There will be more, much more, to come in the months ahead. There are so many things we can do, many of them are not even hard to implement. The journey ahead of us will not be easy. Anyone who truly seeks to take on this rigged and corrupt system will be faced with a storm of fire that only a few could understand. Right?

I happen to have some children in the front row. They understand. In fact, my one boy, stand up, Eric.

I think he got more subpoenas than any man in the history of our country. So, unfair. Al Capone, you all heard of the great gangster? Al Capone got far less. Billy the Kid almost got none. Jesse James, no. Eric Trump got more subpoenas. He is a Ph.D. in subpoenas. They come from Congress.

I appreciate the job you do and the abuse you’ve taken. I really do.

It hasn't been a joyride for our great first lady either. It hasn't been a joyride. Stand up.

I go home and she says — they do love her. I go home and she says, “You look angry and upset,” and I say, “Just leave me alone.” It hasn't been the easiest thing, but she’s been a great first lady and people love her.

We will be resisted by the combined forces of the establishment, the media, the special interests, the globalists, the marxist radicals, the woke corporations, the weaponized power of the government, the colossal political machines, the tidal wave of dark money and the most dangerous domestic censorship system ever created by man or woman, the most dangerous system we’ve ever had. We will be attacked. We will be slandered. We will be persecuted, just as I have been, I mean I have been. But many people in this room have been. But we will not be intimidated. We will persevere, we will stand tall in the storm, we will march forward into the torrent. And we in the end will win. Our country will win. We will win.

My fellow Americans, we will join together and reverse this staggering American decline and it is staggering indeed and we will again restore the spirit of our nation. And then, we must build and raise up a legacy that will stand without equal in the entire history of the world. With your help, we will create communities where our children will grow up safe and strong. And a nation where they will grow up free and prosperous and well. We will re-establish the principles of hard work and merit and end the scourge of homelessness that is plaguing our beleaguered Democrat-run cities. We will heal our divisions and bring our people back together through incredible success. We will defend life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We will expand the frontiers of human knowledge and extend the horizons of human achievement and we will plant our beautiful American flag very soon on the surface of Mars, which I got started. But we need everyone involved. We need everyone’s help. We need to look out for one another. We need to be friends. And we need every patriot on board.

Because this is not just a campaign. This is a quest to save our country. I am talking about saving our country.

Thank you very much. Thank you very much. I am asking for your vote, I am asking for your support, and I am asking for your friendship and your prayers on this very incredible but dangerous journey.

If our movement remains united and confident, then we will shatter the forces of tyranny and we will unleash the glories of liberty for ourselves and for our children and for generations yet to come. America's golden age is just ahead. And together, we will make America powerful again.

We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. We will make America glorious again. And we will make America great again.

Thank you very much. God bless you, all."

A Ukrainian drone struck a Russian oil tanker early Saturday off the eastern coast of Russia-occupied Crimea, a day after a Ukrainian drone struck a Russian warship on the Black Sea. The attacks — the most serious strikes on the Russian Navy since last year — coincided with a new directive from Ukraine’s maritime authority warning that six Russian Black Sea ports would be considered “war risk” areas until further notice.

While Ukraine has grown bolder in recent days, including firing drones at Moscow, Russia has turned to regular attacks on the Black Sea, a crucial economic hub. The attacks appear to demonstrate that both sides are increasingly ready to open a new dimension in the war, taking violence to places that have largely been spared until now.

The attacks beyond the established battlefields come as Ukraine presses on with a counteroffensive that it launched in the south and east around two months ago, with no sign yet that Russian lines have been decisively breached.

Trump. Right-wing lawmakers have pledged to cut the department’s budget and proposed a slew of restrictions on the agency, including defunding the special counsel overseeing investigations of the former president and withholding funding for a new F.B.I. headquarters.

“I will not vote for ANY appropriations bill to fund the weaponization of government,” Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, pledged on Twitter as she announced her proposal to defund the office of the special counsel in the Trump investigations. It is not yet clear whether that measure will be added to the legislation.

Such provisions could render many of the G.O.P.-written spending bills dead on arrival in the Democratic-controlled Senate, paving the way for a government shutdown if the disputes cannot be resolved by Sept. 30 or automatic spending cuts in early 2025 if Congress fails to clear all dozen of the individual spending bills.

Adding so-called “riders” — provisions that sometimes have little to do with the underlying legislation — to appropriations bills was once a common practice for lawmakers seeking to influence policy on an array of hot-button issues, such as abortion and the environment.

But as the appropriations process on Capitol Hill has broken down in recent years, huge packages lumping all or most federal funding together in one take-it-or-leave it bill negotiated by congressional leaders in both parties have replaced individual spending measures, limiting the opportunities for rank-and-file lawmakers to tack on such items."

More than 62 percent of Americans ages 25 and up do not hold bachelor’s degrees, and the earnings gap between those with a college education and those without one has never been wider. In 2021, the difference between the median earnings of younger workers with bachelor’s degrees and workers of the same age with high-school diplomas only was $22,000 — the largest since the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began tracking earnings in 1990. That’s happening even as the cost of college spirals upward, putting it out of reach for many. This has fueled anxiety, bitterness and a sense of alienation among the millions who see themselves as shut out of an economy that does not value them.

Making college more affordable is important, but there are other keys to the doors of opportunity as well. With an executive order issued on Jan. 18, his first full day as governor, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania used one of them: He eliminated the requirement of a four-year college degree for the vast majority of jobs in the state government, a change similar to one that Maryland and Utah made last year. This demonstrates both good policy and good leadership, representing a concrete change in hiring philosophy that stops reducing people to a credential and conveys that everyone — college-educated or not — has experience and worth that employers should consider. It is a step — and a mind-set — that other leaders should consider as well.

The decision was driven in part by the realities of a tight labor market. Unemployment in Pennsylvania is 3.9 percent — close to the national average of 3.5 percent — and lower than it was before the pandemic. Public and private employers have been struggling to find qualified applicants, prompting a re-evaluation of hiring criteria. As Mr. Shapiro’s order notes, “In the modern labor market, applicants gain knowledge, skills and abilities through a variety of means, including apprenticeships, on-the-job training, military training and trade schools.”

His move opens up 92 percent of state government jobs — approximately 65,000 positions — to anyone with “the relevant work experience and skills-based training, regardless of their educational attainment.” Job postings will emphasize experience over education."

Now scientists were arguing about ‌‌the causes of obesity, which affects more than 40 percent of U.S. adults and costs the health system about $173 billion each year. At the meeting’s closing session, ‌John Speakman, a biologist, offered ‌‌this conclusion on the subject: ‌ “There’s no consensus whatsoever about what the cause of it‌ is.”

That’s not to say the researchers disagreed on everything. The three-day meeting was infused with an implicit understanding of what obesity is not: a personal failing. No presenter argued that humans collectively lost willpower around the 1980s, when obesity rates took off, first in high-income countries‌, then in much of the rest of the world. Not a single scientist said our genes changed in that short time. Laziness, gluttony‌‌ and sloth were not referred to as obesity’s helpers. In stark contrast to a prevailing societal view of obesity, which assumes people have full control over their body size, they didn’t blame individuals for their condition, the same way we don’t blame people suffering from the effects of undernutrition, like stunting and wasting.

The researchers instead referred to obesity as a complex, chronic condition, and they were meeting to get to the bottom of why humans have, collectively, grown larger over the past half century. To that end, they shared a range of mechanisms that might explain the global obesity surge. And their theories, however diverse, made one thing obvious: As long as we treat obesity as a personal responsibility issue, its prevalence is unlikely to decline."

Chaotic protests broke out last night shortly after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired his defense minister for criticizing a divisive judicial overhaul. The dismissal intensified an already dramatic domestic crisis — one of the gravest in Israeli history.

Netanyahu’s decision appeared as an unmistakable signal that the government intends to proceed with a final vote in Parliament early this week on the first part of proposed changes. The plan would give the legislature greater control over the Supreme Court. But if his intent was to muscle through the judicial changes with a fait accompli, his action may have backfired.

From the graph, we can see that the lines, with steps for the off-season, shown for LeBron James and for Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, have about the same average slope. (See Stat Nugget below.) This means that James accumulated points at about the same rate as did Abdul-Jabbar. Since he is now scoring about 30 points per game, he could surpass 40,000 points before he bows out of basketball. Time will tell by how many points he will surpass Abdul-Jabbar.

This graph is one of six that were published in the New York Times article “LeBron James Outscored Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and All the N.B.A. Greats.” This graph displays how James, in terms of his age, was ahead of the pack of all basketball players for his entire career. Lisa Leslie, the retired W.N.B.A. star, said that James is “the most dominant point guard, two-guard, small forward and power forward all in one” because of his size, speed, explosiveness and overall basketball I.Q. The graph backs this up.

There were so many great headlines this week, especially from New Jersey. There must be either LeBron James fever, a love of basketball or excellence in writing headlines in the Garden State. Here are some that captured the main idea of the graph: “LeBron James: The Young NBA Career Scoring Leader” by Gabe of Auburn High School in Massachusetts; “LeBron James: Youngest with Most Career Points” by Colleen of Academy of Saint Elizabeth in Morristown, N.J.; three from students at Perth Amboy High School in New Jersey — “King James Reigns Supreme Amongst NBA’s Elite: Top 250 Scorers Announced!” by Cesar, “LeBron James Sweeps the Court: Will He Stay on Top?” by Alida, and “LeBron’s Journey to Becoming a Legend” by Michelle and two from New Jersey (no school name given) “LeBron James Shoots His Way Past Abdul-Jabbar and Straight Into History” by Kaitlin and “New King in Town: LeBron Takes the Crown for Highest Career Points” by Isabella.

You may want to think about these additional questions:

How many points a basketball player scores is affected by more than the player’s skill, durability, creativity and talent. What other factors may have influenced Abdul-Jabbar and James on their way to their stellar scoring records?

There are five more graphs in the article that use some of the data in the released graph:

The changes have prompted widespread criticism from prominent literary figures and others, including Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of Britain. The books’ publisher, Puffin Books, and the author’s estate did not immediately respond to questions about the nature of the changes. However, The Telegraph, a British newspaper, earlier reported that hundreds of words, including descriptions of characters’ appearances, races and genders, had been changed or removed in at least 10 of the author’s 19 children’s books.

Dahl died in 1990. A review of the author’s works began in 2020, before Netflix acquired the Roald Dahl Story Company, which manages the author’s copyrights and trademarks, Rick Behari, a company spokesman, said in a statement on Monday.

“When publishing new print runs of books written years ago, it’s not unusual to review the language used alongside updating other details including a book’s cover and page layout,” Mr. Behari said, adding that the efforts were led together with Puffin. “Our guiding principle throughout has been to maintain the story lines, characters, and the irreverence and sharp-edged spirit of the original text.”"

Mr. Blinken and Mr. Xi held talks at the Great Hall of the People, the grand building on the west side of Tiananmen Square where Mr. Xi often receives dignitaries.

In most of the world, the authorities can’t do much about it. Even as the software grows more sophisticated and accessible, few laws exist to manage its spread.

China hopes to be the exception. This month, the country adopted expansive rules requiring that manipulated material have the subject’s consent and bear digital signatures or watermarks, and that deepfake service providers offer ways to “refute rumors.”

But China faces the same hurdles that have stymied other efforts to govern deepfakes: The worst abusers of the technology tend to be the hardest to catch, operating anonymously, adapting quickly and sharing their synthetic creations through borderless online platforms.

Support for abortion rights now appears to be one of the big reasons Democrats defied history and staved off deep midterm losses. In a new article, my colleague Elizabeth Dias and I explain how Democrats changed the politics of an issue that’s long been most galvanizing for their opponents.

Democratic campaigns invested more heavily in abortion rights than any other topic, riding a wave of anger after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June. In total, Democrats and their allies spent nearly half a billion dollars on ads mentioning abortion — more than twice what they spent on crime, and eight times as much as Republicans spent on abortion, according to AdImpact, an ad-tracking firm.

The impact

In Virginia, Minnesota, New Mexico and elsewhere, abortion rights emerged as a driving force in the midterm elections, helping Democrats win ballot measures, governor’s races and House seats."

In the summer, the Supreme Court fully overturned Roe v. Wade, a decision long expected, but one that still seemed to shock even the people who wanted it — even after the surreal publication of a drafted opinion in the spring. The fact that it really did happen — that suddenly a woman had to drive into another state to get an abortion so that she wouldn’t potentially die from complications — not only carried that kind of real-life consequence in a thousand private moments of people’s lives, but also opened up a world of other possibilities about what could happen. Maybe the court would roll back marriage equality. Or sign off on “independent state legislature” theory, an obscure theory adopted by a group of right-wingers that would grant expanded powers to state legislatures in carrying out elections and risk destabilizing the entire system.

Accompanying all these events was a disorienting, high-stakes discourse about how to talk about conspiracy theories and antidemocratic threats, and about how much to do so. We know that what people say — what we say — on social platforms, and certainly in the media, shapes the way people perceive politics, but in a way that can be hard to measure — an awareness that can convert every piece or post into an opportunity or mistake. Writers argued that excessively focusing on democracy might alienate rather than persuade voters, or even corrupt institutions by intertwining constitutional and partisan concerns.

Then there was the world beyond discourse, where no one could control much of anything beyond one man. For months, for years, since the 2014 annexation of Crimea and the West’s tepid response to it, people had warned that Vladimir Putin would eventually launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine — then it happened. Not many people in Russia or anywhere else seemed to want this beyond Mr. Putin, but that did nothing to prevent Ukraine from becoming the kind of place where a boy has to figure out for himself that troops shot his mother and stepfather because nobody knows how to tell him, where people had to drink the water from radiators to stay alive, where reflecting on brutal deaths in one city, someone can find themselves grimly observing, “In theory, international bodies have the authority to prosecute war crimes wherever and whenever they occur.”

The quick transition of the invasion from something expected but hypothetical into something very real, with needless deaths and millions of Ukrainians and Russians leaving their homes maybe forever, opened up other dark possibilities. It seemed existential, first for Ukraine, then for the rest of Eastern Europe. The NATO alliance, if things escalated, could fracture. The possibility of China invading Taiwan — and the possibility of full-scale global war — suddenly seemed easier to imagine, and even expect. Nuclear weapons became something people had to think about, seriously. And more immediately, it seemed as though disruptions in natural gas, battery and grain production and distribution would crash countries far and wide.

The debate about whether post-pandemic inflation might be transitory gave way to whether this might be the 1970s with the pain of stagflation and energy shortages; then whether the crypto collapse might have 2000s housing-market flavors; what popping energy prices in Europe might do to politics there and beyond; and worst, whether grain prices would cause a wave of starvation around the world. On the Bloomberg financial podcast “Odd Lots,” the hosts frequently observe there’s been a “perfect storm” of crisis conditions: in shipping logistics, coffee prices, copper production shortages, the challenges of starting to pump more oil, seemingly everything has broken down or gone awry a bit all at the same time. Is this just a heightened period of unusual events, or a lull before interlocking pieces collapse?"

Research shows that even short periods of pretrial detention can lead to increased recidivism.

The effect of the bail law changes approved in recent years has been hotly debated, with supporters and opponents both claiming that facts validate their positions. But the available data cannot yet deliver a full verdict on the law. Its impact on reducing recidivism will only become clear over time, as people avoid the destabilizing effects of pretrial detention — like the loss of a job, home or custody of a child.

Progressive Democrats are also seeking to attach a number of liberal measures to the final budget, while fighting Ms. Hochul’s proposal to increase tuition at the state’s public universities. These Democrats have also proposed far-reaching legislation to protect tenants from eviction and make multibillion dollar investments in education, health care and reducing the effects of climate change, in addition to those Ms. Hochul has put forth.

They have pitched the policies as a way to appeal to overlooked communities — and to expand the Democratic base.

“If you look at the election, it wasn’t Long Island and upstate New York Republicans that delivered her win, it was more progressive Democrats in the city of New York, who got her her win,” said State Senator Liz Krueger, a Democrat from Upper Manhattan who is helping to lead the budget negotiations. “Yet clearly, a lesson from that election was she almost lost to a MAGA Republican in a blue state, spending $100 million.”"

His firm is also involved in the East Side Coastal Resiliency project, an initiative to protect part of Manhattan, including East River Park on the Lower East Side, from rising waters because of climate change. The preliminary phase has involved razing what is there now, including beloved trees and fields, which has produced some tensions in the community. “The more people you touch, the more opinions you solicit,” Mr. Ingels said of the divisive and long-term undertaking. “But I think most of the residents who experienced Hurricane Sandy would probably prefer to remain dry.”"

We should all be feminists, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie wrote, and at this point in climate change, we should probably also all be vegans (at least for part of the week).

But in Andrew Lipstein’s ingenious second novel, avoiding meat and dairy is a sign that something has gone seriously wrong. Sort of like when Rosemary Woodhouse found herself nibbling on a raw chicken heart, part of the mounting evidence she was pregnant with Satan’s child, but in reverse.

Like “Rosemary’s Baby,” “The Vegan” features young marrieds mulling conception and living in a highly desirable part of New York City — then, a four-room apartment in a Victorian building on the West Side of Manhattan; now, a brick townhouse in Cobble Hill— and a dinner party where a guest is effectively roofied.

Only here the perpetrator is the protagonist, one Herschel Caine (which, were you to consult a naming dictionary, translates roughly to “deer killer”): partner at a quantitative hedge fund, with $2.8 million in his bank account, growing qualms about his line of work and a keep-up-with-the-Joneses anxiety about his neighbors, one of whom is a Guggenheim."

Baby boomers, a reputedly upbeat lot, are probably not considering whether there will be enough space to inter them after they’ve all died. Philip Bump, cynical Gen Xer, goes right there and then some.

In his new book, “The Aftermath,” which considers the socioeconomic and political impact of America’s noisiest if no longer largest living generation, Bump measures the average coffin, multiplies its dimensions by the number of surviving people born in the United States between 1946 and 1964 — 74 millionish — and figures their corpses can be squeezed into 43 square miles. “We could simply take all of the land that’s part of the Walt Disney World complex and convert it into the most densely packed cemetery in North America,” he suggests. “The Grievingest Place on Earth.™”

One longs for more such lightning flashes of wit to jolt a study that’s commendably ambitious — immigration, racism, technology and climate change are considered — but can be digressive and (at least for a “word person”) numbingly number-centric.

Bump is a columnist for The Washington Post with a 1950s egghead vibe who writes an appealing newsletter called How to Read This Chart. Promotional copy for “The Aftermath” calls him “a journalist as adept with a graph as with a paragraph,” and indeed there are so many bars, squiggles, arrows, circles, dots, numbers and pictograms within these pages — 128 charts in total — that poring over them might make that hypothetical word person feel a little cross-eyed and frantic, like Goofy in the old cartoon short “How to Play Football.”"

At the same time, the government announced that it would support two major plans for capturing carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and factories, and injecting the gas into depleted reservoirs under the North Sea. Such “carbon capture” projects tend to be mostly led by energy companies and make use of their expertise and infrastructure.

The announcements were an indication that the North Sea oil and gas industry is becoming an important battleground for Britain’s next general election, in 2024. The governing Conservative Party appears to have decided that protecting the industry could be a vote-winner over the opposition Labour Party, which has threatened to halt new drilling permits if it wins next year."

Lately, Dr. Murthy has been using his position to highlight the issue, much as Dr. C. Everett Koop, who was surgeon general in the 1980s, famously addressed the dangers associated with smoking. Dr. Murthy has been on a listening tour of sorts, speaking with students, health care workers and community groups across the country

He recently spoke with The New York Times about the growing intensity of his focus on this issue. This conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.

You have described mental health as “the defining public health crisis of our time.” Why?

I think of mental health as the fuel that allows us to show up for our communities, our friends, our family and our lives. And when that fuel tank is low, it compromises our ability to be who we can be in our best moments and to show up at work or in school."

But there you have it: Like Picasso’s “Guernica,” painted two years earlier, R.C. Sherriff’s novel “The Hopkins Manuscript” is thrilling precisely because it describes a hellscape so artfully, even as its own existence and endurance offer a ray of hope against annihilation. Now available in a new edition, Sherriff’s novel — an example of the “cozy catastrophe” genre, as our reviewer Alec Nevala-Lee points out — is one of the books we recommend this week.

Also up: a lively collection of obituaries, a charming history of beavers and their impact on the American landscape, a moving memoir by the actor Rob Delaney about his young son’s death, and a surprisingly serious study of cultural attitudes toward the human posterior. (Not too serious: It’s called “Butts: A Backstory,” and its cheeky cover features the airbrushed image of a peach cleft.) We also recommend Jefferson Cowie’s history of white supremacy in Alabama, Shahan Mufti’s account of a 1977 hostage standoff in Washington, D.C., and Judith Thurman’s collection of profiles and other essays. In fiction, besides the Sherriff we like Jamie Marina Lau’s “Gunk Baby,” a sardonic, Klieg-lit tale of consumerism and capitalism gone awry. Happy reading.

—Gregory Cowles

Cowie, a historian at Vanderbilt, recounts four peak periods in the conflict between white Alabamians and the federal government, including the reassertion of white supremacy under Jim Crow and the attempts of Gov. George Wallace and others to nullify the civil rights reforms of the 1950s and ’60s. Essential reading for anyone who hopes to understand the unholy union between racism and the rabid loathing of government."

For the second year in a row, Ms. Hochul has requested changes to the state’s bail laws that would make it easier for judges to detain people before trial. Once again, her proposal met stiff opposition in the Legislature, with Democratic opponents saying that the change would unfairly penalize the poor.

Even so, leaders are reportedly close to an agreement that would allow judges to set bail even if they did not believe there was a flight risk, according to two people familiar with the discussions. The arrangement would mean that judges would no longer need to choose the “least restrictive” means necessary to make sure defendants returned for court dates. But lawmakers have seemingly agreed to leave intact most of the 2019 changes to the state bail law that made the vast majority of misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies ineligible for bail.

Ms. Hochul has also outlined an ambitious proposal to spur the construction of 800,000 homes statewide. But her plan, which would have set local growth targets and authorized the state to mandate housing in localities that failed to meet goals, met strong opposition from lawmakers, particularly in the Assembly.

And while some Albany observers have surmised that Ms. Hochul has given up on imposing such mandates, she has remained publicly skeptical that incentives alone will the spur the volume of construction necessary to meet the housing needs of New York. Other housing issues, such as extended tax rebates for developers, and creative rezoning that could boost supply, are still on the table.

Why It Matters

Ms. Hochul has repeatedly said that a good budget is better than an on-time budget. Indeed, this is far from the latest negotiations have run: The budget wasn’t passed until early August in 2010, just days short of the record set in 2004, when it passed on Aug. 11.

State workers will continue to receive their paychecks, thanks to extender bills. But some things are not so easily put off.

On April 26, New York City’s executive budget plan is due — which will be a challenge, given the uncertainty in Albany.

And the budget clock is not the only one that is ticking: The 2023 legislative session runs only until June 8. The longer lawmakers spend on the budget, the less time they will have to address anything else.

What’s Next

When bail and housing agreements materialize, lawmakers must turn to a plethora of other issues, including:

How will New York pay for the drastic emissions reductions required under the 2019 climate law? Will the state expand the number of charter schools, raise the minimum wage or ban menthol cigarettes?

Who will make up funding shortages for the subway?

Time may tell."

For millions of Americans and for many young people in particular, the 2020s have been — thus far — a time of anxiety and dread, marked by social disruption, failing institutions and a deepening sense of urgency over the ability of humans to survive on this planet without destroying its environment.

But there’s not much in American culture that captures the dread and anxiety felt by young people and fueled by the looming climate crisis; the doomerism that feeds apathy, even indifference, about the future and what it holds; and the belief, still present and still potent, that something can and must be done.

There is at least one mirror that reflects this reality: the director Paul Schrader’s 2017 drama “First Reformed.”

At 76 (around 70 at the time of filming), Schrader may not be attuned to the rhythms of modern American youth, but “First Reformed” demonstrates an uncanny grasp of the anxieties that pulse through America’s young people and, to some degree, the nation at large.

Like so many of Schrader’s films, “First Reformed” is about the existential crisis of a flawed man facing an even worse society. In this instance, the man is Toller, a Dutch Reformed minister at a dying church, played with Calvinist intensity by Ethan Hawke. As he struggles with alcoholism and works through a crisis of faith brought on by the death of his son in Iraq, Toller is asked to counsel Michael, a radical environmentalist who wants his wife, Mary (played by Amanda Seyfried), to get an abortion rather than bring life into a doomed world.

Toller finds himself torn between Mary’s optimism and Michael’s despair, between his faltering faith and a new prophetic fervor brought on by fear of climate destruction, between his obligations to his church and congregation and the moral sacrifices necessary to keep both afloat.

Sitting as he does at the emotional center of the film, Toller embodies the energy of the millions of young Americans who see climate devastation on the near horizon. He speaks to their fear, he speaks to their anxiety, and occasionally, he speaks to their hope.

“Courage is the solution to despair. Reason provides no answers,” Toller says early in the film. “I can’t know what the future will bring. We have to choose despite uncertainty. Wisdom is holding two contradictory truths in our mind simultaneously: hope and despair. A life without despair is a life without hope. Holding these two ideas in our head is life itself.”

Schrader, himself raised in a strict Calvinist household, is channeling an age-old tension of American religious life, a dilemma tied to the nation’s Puritan and millenarian heritage. There is the fear of apocalypse and judgment — of a sinful nation in the face of a righteous God — and there is also the promise of salvation, atonement and resurrection for that sinful nation.

Ours may be a more secular age than the past, but as Schrader clearly sees, that doesn’t mean we aren’t possessed of the religious impulses that shaped our forebears. Some roots run a little too deep."

Diagnoses of mental illness among adolescents have been on the rise, and in May the U.S. surgeon general warned of “ample indicators” that social media may in part be to blame. In June, a psychologist called for a nationwide ban of cellphones in schools. By next March, kids under 18 in Utah will be allowed to use TikTok and Instagram only if they have explicit parental permission.

But perhaps banning social media — or heavily monitoring kids who use it, which is another common parental response — isn’t the most constructive solution to the problem. Perhaps, instead, we should focus more on helping kids learn how to safely navigate social media and manage online privacy and decision-making. This is the argument Devorah Heitner, an expert on children’s relationships with media and technology, makes in her new book, “Growing Up in Public: Coming of Age in a Digital World.”

The mother of a high schooler, Dr. Heitner, who holds a doctorate in media, technology and society and is also the author of “Screenwise: Helping Kids Thrive (and Survive) in Their Digital World,” knows how strongly parents want to protect their children from online threats. But the choices parents make in service of this goal often undermine the parent-child relationship and paradoxically put kids at more risk, she argues. Their fear-driven decisions “can get in the way of building trust and building skills,” she said, and provide parents with a false sense of security.

Here are some key takeaways from Dr. Heitner’s latest book and tips she shared for helping kids and teenagers safely navigate the online world."

What issues do you hope to prioritize in your campaign?

There were so many pieces of the Build Back Better Act that were unfortunately left on the cutting room floor, and it is going to be critical for Congress to pick up those policies, like paid family and medical leave, affordable early childhood education and elder care. Those types of policies will be at the heart of my campaign, as will policies that I fought for in the Delaware General Assembly, like gun safety and reproductive rights. One of the issues where we have to continue to make progress is climate change. We can’t build a fairer, more just world if we also don’t protect our planet.

A wave of bills in recent years have affected transgender people, like limiting transitioning procedures for children and restricting which bathrooms transgender people can use. What are your concerns going forward?

The policies that you mentioned are wrong and unconstitutional, and they are an attempt by MAGA Republicans to distract from the fact that they have absolutely no agenda for families and for workers in our country. They are solutions in search of a problem. They are cruel, and we know that policies that target young people, that target parents, that target families, that target vulnerable people in our society, they never wear well in history. I truly believe that democracy only works when it includes all of us."

Executives who are paid in shares and stock options have an incentive to make the stock price go up. Corporate governance law emphasizes disclosure so shareholders have the information they need to decide whether to stay or sell. One problem: Market-based discipline doesn’t work for shareholders if they care about things other than the share price, such as fighting climate change.

Haan has a fresh perspective on the agency problem — the fact that shareholders own the company but their agents, the executives, effectively control it. Since so many shareholders were women, it was easy for (male) professors and executives to think of shareholders as passive and managers as active, she argues.

Alfred Sloan Jr., the head of General Motors, gave the game away in 1926 when he wrote of his fear that “diffusion of stock ownership must enfeeble the corporation by depriving it of virile interest in management upon the part of some one man or group of men to whom its success is a matter of personal and vital interest.” “Virile”? As Haan puts it, “Although Sloan did not mention women directly, his word choice suggests a gendered meaning.”

Sexism was blatant for decades. When in 1953 a female shareholder of Standard Oil of New Jersey asked why the company had no female directors, even though it reported having more women than men as shareholders, the chairman, Frank Abrams, said the company hadn’t found a woman “who can contribute to the problems we have to face.” He added, “I was going to say that first they would start with our interior decorating.”

The firmly held belief that women were content to be passive owners wasn’t even accurate. Haan recounts the activism of several women, including Wilma Soss, who challenged corporate policies that required female employees to retire at 55, versus 65 for men, and was forcibly removed from an annual meeting of IBM for persisting in trying to nominate a female director from the floor."

Farms with cover crops or rows planted perpendicular to the slope seemed to suffer fewer mudslides; wind breaks of trees or hedges slightly reduced the destruction of crops. Such observations have spurred interest in these techniques even among those who use conventional farming methods but want to make their farms more resistant to extreme weather. “It’s a matter of creating a more resilient landscape, where the landscape can adjust to whatever conditions we have, either drought or overwater,” says Luis Cruz-Arroyo, who directs the Agriculture Department’s Natural Resource Conservation Service in the Caribbean.

These kinds of practices can reduce costs too. Imported fertilizers can cost 25 percent more in Puerto Rico than they do on the mainland. “There is a huge incentive to minimize inputs,” Cruz-Arroyo says. More and more, farmers are interested in not tilling their soil at all, for instance; untilled soil means reduced erosion and the preservation of its organic material. There is something of a paradox here: No-till and other soil-focused techniques can actually lower crop yields, but if they lower costs by reducing the need for fertilizers and fuel, Cruz-Arroyo says, farmers can still earn more than they would otherwise.

Gould says that agriculture in Puerto Rico is at an “inflection point.” By the 1960s, the island was largely deforested, a legacy of intensive agriculture. Today tropical forest covers 50 to 60 percent of its area. To the degree that intensive agriculture, especially for commodity crops like sugar, was replaced by other industries, industrialization may have helped forests recover in Puerto Rico. That’s good for the climate (trees sequester carbon), biodiversity and the soils.

Now, as Puerto Rico contemplates the expansion of its agricultural sector, it has a unique opportunity to shape it in a more environmentally sustainable way. “There’s interest, resources and a lot of scientific expertise on the island,” Gould says. “It’s an exciting time.”

Almost five years to the day after Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico, Hurricane Fiona made landfall on the island in September. Fiona wasn’t as powerful as Maria, but it dumped huge amounts of rain, which led to flooding, mudslides and an islandwide blackout that took weeks to resolve fully. At least 25 people died. And every farmer I was in touch with had to deal with significant damage. One lost entire fields of plantain trees, and his workers’ homes were left without water and electricity. On another farm, rushing water had carved a new — and now dried-up — river bed. Aponte, however, prepared by his experience with Maria, emerged relatively unscathed. The metal structures he had been building remained intact, and he had to contend with only a few fallen trees. By late October, he was planting recao right on schedule."

My mind’s eye has me in a booster seat there, and my earliest restaurant memories are tastes of El Cholo’s cheese enchiladas, with their tangy reddish-brown sauce, and of warm corn tortillas, oozing with melting butter and a bit of salt. In those Catholic days of meatless Fridays, the Mexican menu was a refuge with its chiles rellenos, rice and beans, so my mother and my older brother and I would collect Dad at his aerospace plant and head into the city.

In this scientific intervention, Hertog recounts the moment, in 2002, when Hawking declared: “I have changed my mind. ‘Brief History’ is written from the wrong perspective.” Hertog agreed.

Ethan Kelly reads the audiobook with a confidence that suggests he has just emerged from the same Cambridge University halls where Hawking and Hertog discussed their ideas — this audiobook can make the listener feel smarter than he or she is. We’d been thinking of cosmology all wrong, Hawking and Hertog theorized, from a “God’s-eye view” that obscured the scientist’s essential truth: “We are within the universe, not somehow outside it.”

Some of the deep dives into new, interior viewpoints might lose the average listener, but the heavy stuff is broken up with refreshing anecdotes that illustrate not only the author’s devotion to his mentor but also the extent of Hawking’s brilliance — and sense of humor. “I am dying,” Hawking once typed into the machine that spoke for him, making Hertog suffer through a long pause before he finished: “… for … a … cup … of … tea.”

To help us feel anchored again in our physical world, there are birds. At least, they’ve always served that purpose for Mya-Rose Craig, the author of BIRDGIRL: Looking to the Skies in Search of a Better Future (Macmillan Audio, 9 hours, 30 minutes). The 21-year-old Craig is a prodigy of sorts within the vast (and growing) world of birders. She clocked 325 species in one year alone — when she was 6. While early trips took her around the English countryside from her home outside Bristol, soon she was accompanying her parents to Ecuador, Antarctica and beyond. By 17, she had become the youngest person ever to have seen more than 5,000 bird species."

Usually they included an elephant or perhaps a tiger or a woman in a shimmering sari. The messy problems of multiethnic democracy, a tangled bureaucracy shot through with corruption, the great difficulty of dragging hundreds of millions of people out of poverty — these would all be overcome through ingenuity, technology and India’s relentless spirit of progress. The cyclical nature of these magazine covers brought to mind the famous quip about Brazil: India was the country of the future and always would be.

But now it appears that the time has finally arrived: India is indeed the nation of the moment. It is a critical player in just about every major issue facing the planet. Its economy is now bigger than that of the country that colonized it, making it the fifth largest in the world. It is expected to outrank China in population this year, if it hasn’t already. The Ukraine crisis has shown how desperately great powers around the world want to count on it as an ally. There will be no successful solution to climate change without India. It holds the presidency of the Group of 20, and its summit in Delhi this year promises to be a major moment on the global stage for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Apple reportedly plans to make up to a quarter of its iPhones in India — a huge endorsement of the country’s growing technology manufacturing prowess. India was the toast of the Davos World Economic Forum this year; the writer Fareed Zakaria declared that it “might be the most optimistic country in the world right now.”

So it is perhaps unsurprising that a new British documentary that chronicles one of the most violent chapters of India’s postindependence history, a chapter in which Modi plays a central role, has been welcomed by India’s government like a skunk at a garden party.

Even though the documentary, “India: The Modi Question,” which was made by the BBC, could not easily be watched in India, the government cracked down hard. It used emergency powers to ask that Twitter and YouTube block links to bootlegged clips, and the platforms quickly complied. When groups of students tried to screen illicit copies on campuses, the police roughed up and detained them. On one campus in New Delhi, administrators shut off the electricity to prevent a screening."

A prominent one has been that the continent is experiencing a return to the 1930s, a high tide for extremist forces. Yet the comparison lacks bite on many fronts. Europe’s fascists, for one, rose to power in a period of intense social confrontation: Hitler and Mussolini prevailed after labor movements tried to instigate revolutions. A muscular proletariat is conspicuously absent from the European scene today, fatally weakened by deindustrialization and loose labor markets.

In contrast to the 1930s, when fascist street violence flourished, the contemporary far right thrives on demobilization. Ms. Meloni’s party won a majority of votes in an election in which nearly four out of 10 Italians stayed home, with turnout down by almost 10 percent from the country’s previous vote. In France, Ms. Le Pen’s National Rally has long received its best tallies in parts of the country that have the highest voter abstention rates. And in Poland, the Kaczynski family behind the Law and Justice party rules over a country where fewer than 1 percent of citizens are members of a political party.

There is another critical difference, too. Hitler and Mussolini promised their national elites the equivalents of the colonial empires that their French and British competitors had long ago acquired. Today’s far right has an alternative worldview. Rather than expand outward, their main desire is to shield Europe from the rest of the world. They have accepted that the continent will no longer be a protagonist in the 21st century; the best one can hope for is protection from the hordes. In Jean Raspail’s 1973 novel “The Camp of Saints” — which has become a manual for the contemporary far right — the aim of Europe’s supposed saviors is not to conquer Africa but simply to keep its inhabitants south of the Mediterranean.

Low ambitions define the far right’s international approach, starting with the European Union. For decades, far-right parties focused their ire on the bloc’s undemocratic constraints, even championing exit from the union. Such defiance has died away. Far-right politicians still fulminate against immigration laws but say less about their nations’ reliance on European funds. The union, for its part, is increasingly geopolitically dependent on the United States and its industry is losing out to China. While Hitler tried to break an Anglo-American order and made a bid for global domination, Europe’s new authoritarians are happy to occupy a niche within the existing power structure. The goal is adaptation to decline, not its reversal.

Europe’s far-right advance does not follow a natural law. In Spain the far-right party Vox lost voters in the last election, partly because of the left-wing coalition government’s impressively low inflation figures. Yet Vox did manage to shift Spain’s political center of gravity to the right. Though many Spanish farmers were unable to sow this year because of this summer’s persistent drought, climate issues hardly figured as a theme during the campaign. In other countries, notably the Netherlands, the far right’s popularity has severely undermined efforts to mitigate the damage of climate change."

It formed the Northeast Alliance with American Airlines in 2021 and a year later announced its planned acquisition of the ultralow-cost carrier Spirit Airlines. At a time when four airlines and their tightly coupled networks control 80 percent of domestic traffic, the U.S. government is fighting both deals. Last month a federal judge ordered JetBlue and American to disentangle the Northeast Alliance. American said it would appeal.

As a journalist who has covered big mergers and airline operations, I’m taking the government’s side in this fight. If JetBlue is allowed to grow as big as it wants, market forces figure to make the JetBlue Effect evaporate like a vapor trail from one of its jets.

In other parts of the travel and hospitality industry, innovation is a driving force. Hyatt Hotels, for instance, just started a concept called Hyatt Studios, for extended-stay guests, which is the latest of the more than two dozen brands in the company’s portfolio. Innovation in airlines, however, is rarer than reward seats during the holiday season. While most goods and services improve over decades, air travel has defied progress — with the very important exception of safety. Innovative airline start-ups are relatively rare. One of the most recent is Breeze Airways, founded by David Neeleman — who also founded JetBlue.

Why don’t airlines innovate? Part of the answer is that they are in a capital-intense business and are largely driven by chief financial officers, while hotel management companies are asset-light and are driven by customer service managers. The former asks: How much more money can I squeeze out of this very expensive piece of equipment? The latter asks: How can I improve the customer experience and get paid for it? Which is why the experience of arriving at your hotel is so much better than the experience of flying to your destination.

The operating structure of the industry has also made innovation difficult, particularly since pandemic lockdowns lifted. When JetBlue started, it attracted thousands of résumés from pilots. Today, the carriers are short thousands of pilots and other professionals. Likewise, there were takeoff and landing slots available at J.F.K. in 2000. Today, the four major carriers control most of these precious slots in major airports and aren’t keen to surrender them. Want new jets? The production wait can be years long."

I thought about his story in 2017 when I found myself struggling with loneliness. My first stint as surgeon general had just ended. I was suddenly disconnected from the colleagues with whom I had spent most of my waking hours. It might not have been so bad had I not made a critical mistake: I had largely neglected my friendships during my tenure, convincing myself that I had to focus on work and I couldn’t do both.

Even when I was physically with the people I loved, I wasn’t present — I was often checking the news and responding to messages in my inbox. After my job ended, I felt ashamed to reach out to friends I had ignored. I found myself increasingly lonely and isolated, and it felt as if I was the only one who felt that way.

A critical gateway between the Mississippi River and global oceans, New Orleans has been an entry and exit point for the United States since before the Louisiana Purchase. The city is now betting that position will continue — and even deepen — as the world enters a new era of global integration.

The New Orleans port is one of the nation’s busiest for agricultural exports like soybeans and corn. But it has struggled to compete for the lucrative imports that are ferried on huge ships from Asia in part because those vessels cannot fit under a local bridge. As global supply chains rearrange in the pandemic’s wake, New Orleans’s proximity to Mexico and its position on the Mississippi River could help make it a crucial stop in what many expect to be a more resilient and supply chain of the future.

Executives at the New Orleans port are wagering on that transformation: They recently unveiled a plan to spend $1.8 billion on expanding the port to a new site that can handle more trade and accommodate bigger boats."

Putin fed speculation about a broader crackdown on Tuesday in a closed-door meeting with Russian media figures at the Kremlin, where he said he was delving into Prigozhin’s lucrative business contracts with the Russian Defense Ministry.

Officially, there is no hall of fame for unhappy families. But even the staunchest Russian novelist might be hard pressed to match the particular gift for dysfunction that the Wilcoxes, subjects of Jess Row’s sprawling metafiction “The New Earth,” display with such impressive esprit de corps across nearly 600 dense and often wildly discursive pages. Death and divorce are a given; immigration, climate change and crises of faith crowd the margins, clambering to compete with a thousand-year conflict in the Middle East. Incest eventually enters the chat, an assiduous but uninvited guest, and race hovers over it all, a quivering question mark. (The impetus for everything, naturally, is a wedding.)

It’s all richly imagined, reflexively neurotic and frequently quite dazzling. It’s also more than a single book, even one guided by a keen and careful hand, can adequately contain: a Gordian knot of domestic melodrama, global politics and high-flying philosophy told in multitudinous forms not limited to voice memos, free-verse poetry and unsent emails. A glowing cover blurb from Jonathan Lethem extols how Row, who promptly breaks the fourth wall on the ninth page, “explodes the family saga from within.” You have been warned.

In fact there’s not a little bit of Lethem in the novel’s distinctly New York setting, and in its many metaphysical wanderings beyond those walls — though Franzen may be a closer Jonathan, at least in the ways that Row (“Nobody Ever Gets Lost”) seems to go almost subcutaneous in his examination of the damage that the nuclear unit of spouses and siblings, parents and offspring can do.

“You want me to cut to the chase, but I’m not cutting to the chase,” one main character scolds a minor player early on, tellingly. “Sometimes time is not of the essence. You have to let a thought expand.” We are not bound by Row’s rules, so let us slice through: Despite their Anglicized name, the Wilcoxes are an immediately recognizable type, Upper West Side Jews long and comfortably defined by the bourgeois markers of their “lox-and-herring-and-Sunday-Times” tribe. Sandy is a lawyer poured in the mold of Gregory Peck, a rangy Midwestern gentile willfully grandfathered into the faith that his wife, Naomi, a brilliant, brittle climate scientist, was raised in but mostly rejects for herself."

The treasurer in North Carolina, Dale R. Folwell, has also taken an interest in the question of what he owes to his constituency. A spokeswoman, Maria Sebekow, wrote to me last month heralding a “bombshell” letter that Mr. Folwell had written calling on Mr. Fink to resign. “This is not mere posturing,” Ms. Sebekow’s pitch added.

But it did represent a kind of hedge. On one hand, Mr. Folwell did not mince his words during our interview. He quipped that E.S.G. should stand for energy independence, safe streets and neighborhoods, and good governance.

On the other hand, the treasurer quite pointedly did not fire Mr. Fink from overseeing some of the state’s money, even as he called on BlackRock’s leader to walk the plank. And that’s because he didn’t want to violate his duty to act in the best interests of the North Carolina residents to whom he answers.

“My fiduciary duty to those that teach, protect and serve, as well as to our retirees, directs that the current North Carolina Retirement Systems investments in BlackRock remain at this time,” he said in a statement. “Our job is to find the best value with the lowest cost and highest margin of safety.”"

A man. A tree. An apple. So begins “Are We Not Drawn Onward to New Era,” a performance piece by the Belgian provocateurs Ontroerend Goed, presented by the Brooklyn Academy of Music in association with the Public Theater’s Under the Radar festival. In the show’s first minutes, an apple is plucked and eaten, a paradise destroyed. Then the story changes.

For nearly three decades, this collective (its name is a Flemish pun that translates loosely to “feel estate”) has goaded theatergoers, sometimes gently and sometimes (“The Smile Off Your Face,” “A Game of You”) less gently. “Are We Not Drawn,” directed by Alexander Devriendt, falls on the milder end of that spectrum, even as it functions as an allegory about climate destruction.

After the apple is devoured, the tree that held it is torn apart by one of the six actors. Not everything in the show is entirely real; the tree very much is. On opening night on Wednesday at BAM Fisher’s Fishman Space, audience members groaned as he ripped branch after branch. If I’m honest I groaned, too — that poor defenseless sapling — even though there’s currently a Christmas tree in the corner of my apartment slowly turning into tinder. Soon a rainbow of plastic grocery bags, the kind that have recently been outlawed in New York, litters the stage. (OK, fine, I have a few of those in my apartment, too.) Then the smoke begins to billow.

This first half-hour, which ends with the stage strewn with trash and filled with smoke is ugly, deliberately, and just a little unintelligible. There’s sparse dialogue throughout, rendered without supertitles. The non-Belgians in the theater will probably assume that it is Flemish. (I did.) It is not. This is one more show in which the troupe toys with its audience, though here it displays better than usual sportsmanship. To say more would ruin the show’s central surprise. But remember that its title is a palindrome, a type of wordplay in which a word or phrase reads the same backward and forward. So after advancing, the show must then reverse. “Are we not drawn” is a parable of disaster, but run the tape backward and it instead promises repair. Paradise, it suggests, can be regained."

The new equipment allowed him to sell back extra power to the grid, but he had no idea just how profitable it would become in the summer heat as the price of power in the state’s electricity market spiked over and over again.

“This summer, it was constant,” Mr. Arizpe, an architectural photographer, said. “I think my best month, I netted about $250, and that’s after paying for running three A/C units. Last summer, I paid $600 a month. Now I’m making $250.”

The crushing heat created demand in Texas beyond all previous records. Wholesale electricity prices were high on many days because it was just so hot. But many other times this summer, the cost of electricity soared during periods when supply was ample and prices should have been low, according to energy traders, consultants and analysts."

“I worry all the time,” said Trudy Hann, 71, who moved to Buckeye in 1980, when the population was just 3,400. Today, it has more than 110,000 residents, and city officials say they envision 1.5 million people living there — enough to rival the current size of Phoenix.

On Saturday afternoon, Ms. Hann and her family huddled under an umbrella in a subdivision of Spanish-tiled homes bordering an unbroken expanse of desert, watching her grandson play flag football on a grassy field fed by treated wastewater.

Inocente Cayetano moved from Goodyear, Ariz., to Buckeye, just 15 miles west, shortly before the pandemic because it was cheap, without a concern about water. He said a starter home cost $100,000 less in Buckeye than it did just one town closer to Phoenix, allowing him to invest his savings in a mobile coffee trailer. The business took off, and he just broke ground on building a storefront location in one of Buckeye’s fancier master-planned communities."

The 31-story building, once the headquarters of A.I.G., has windows all around and a shape suited to extra corner units. In a city with too little housing, it could hold 800 to 900 apartments. Right across the street, one office building not so different from this one has already been turned into housing, and another is on the way.

But 175 Water Street has a hitch: Offices in the financial district are spared some zoning rules that make conversion hard — so long as they were built before 1977. And this one was built six years too late, in 1983.

“There’s nothing about that building — its construction, its mechanicals, its structural engineering — that prevents it from being converted,” said Richard Coles, the managing partner of Vanbarton Group, which has developed both conversions across the street. Vanbarton owned and thought hard about converting 175 Water, too. It looked for a time as if New York might change the 1977 cutoff, a simple no-cost reform to spur more conversions that had the support of Mayor Eric Adams and Gov. Kathy Hochul. A mere stroke of a pen would do it, Mr. Coles said.

But that idea died in the State Legislature this spring, along with the rest of the governor’s housing agenda. When Vanbarton concluded no change was coming, it sold the property."

“I was thinking about the inspiration that New York has given me, and it made me want to explore New York style archetypes, and my own personal New York style archetypes, from when I came to the city for my first job,” Stuart Vevers said in a preview before his lively 10th-anniversary Coach show, held in the heart of Midtown Manhattan at the New York Public Library.

That was back in 1996, he said, and the girls he remembered heading out to dance at the Pyramid Club provided the genetic code for the filmy chiffon slip dresses and shredded striped knits atop leather bras and panties that punctuated his show. Just as the young execs Mr. Vevers recalled “stepping out of their town cars and rejecting power dressing” in favor of slouchy pantsuits brought him to deconstructed oversize trouser suits in moss green and black and sweeping leather trench coats that looked as if they had been put through the wash to soften up the swagger.

They were part of the New York of his mind, a place where people come from elsewhere (Mr. Vevers is British) and find their tribe, which isn’t necessarily defined by geography any more — by uptown or downtown, east or west — but rather by state of mind."

What is the latest on what’s happening in Niger?

The leaders of Mali and Burkina Faso on Tuesday backed the soldiers who claimed to be in charge in Niger. They have much in common: The leaders of Mali and Burkina Faso also seized power in military coups, which led to their suspension from the Economic Community of West African States, a regional union.

After high-profile killings, some officers pull back from proactive practices that keep people safe. The public becomes more reluctant to work with the police. And with less confidence in the justice system, some Americans resort instead to violence to resolve conflicts.

These patterns have happened before. Between 2014 and 2016, murders also increased after widely publicized police killings of Black men in Ferguson, Mo.; Baltimore; and elsewhere. This year, Memphis is among a minority of big cities where murders have increased — and Memphis is also where officers were charged in the beating and killing of Tyre Nichols in January. In most cities, though, this dynamic seems to have diminished since 2020.

The third explanation for the murder drop is government policy: Many places have recently invested more in policing and other anti-violence programs. Cities used Covid relief money to bolster their law enforcement ranks, and some have received federal dollars for community-led efforts to break up violence. In Baltimore, a new strategy of focusing policing and other resources on people with a history of violence seems to be paying off, as The Baltimore Banner reported.

What we don’t know

Experts caution that these three explanations are not proven. And it is possible that the rest of the year will be more violent than the first half. “I do think it’s a little premature to be making any strong conclusions about what it all means just yet,” Jeff Asher, a crime analyst who tracks the big-city murder data, told me.

The lack of certainty is typical in discussions about crime. Starting in the 1990s, crime rates plummeted. Yet decades later, after much scholarship, no consensus has emerged for why violence subsided. Crime is an incredibly complicated topic, involving personal disputes, the economy, social services, the political system and more. A few decades, much less a couple of years, is typically too little time to explain a trend definitively."

For those who love the cold

Walk in the snow

A specialist in slow-travel European walking holidays, InnTravel will introduce two new “snow breaks” this year designed for non-skiers who want to explore the quieter side of winter. A seven-night trip in Bavaria, Germany, offers opportunities to visit the landmark castles of Neuschwanstein and Hohenschwangau under snow, and hike in the area on trails surrounded by the snowcapped Bavarian Alps. In Slovenia, a seven-night trip based in the village of Bohinjska Bistrica, in the northwestern part of the country, puts travelers on the edge of Triglav National Park and in the vicinity of walks around the lakes of Bled and Bohinj. Offered early December to mid-March, the trips start at 1,150 British pounds a person (about $1,333) and include lodging, airport transfers, local bus travel, many meals and some guided activities.

Extend ski season

If you want to prolong winter, hit a spring skiing hot spot such as Lake Tahoe in Northern California. Last April, when most of the major resorts were preparing to close down operations for the season, I visited Palisades Tahoe (formerly known as Squaw Valley) on the lake’s west coast, which boasts skiing that can last into May and beyond at reduced rates. In a trade-off between snow and expense, conditions were not peak — the snow was soft in places and occasionally sparse — but lift tickets were less than $100 a day (single day tickets this season in February are currently running from $149 to $229) and most of the mountain was open (the resort has yet to announce its spring skiing prices). At the end of the day, skiers and riders in T-shirts were drinking craft brews in the sunshine at aprés-ski bars at the base of the village, and many of the hiking and biking trails close to the lake were open and snow-free, offering something of a two-season vacation.

Celebrate the cold

Winters are long in Minnesota, and the organizers behind the annual Great Northern Festival in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul hope they stay that way. The event, Jan. 25 to Feb. 5, highlights the unique winter culture of this northern region with outdoor film screenings, performances, Nordic ski races and tours, ice plunges, the U.S. Pond Hockey Championships contested by amateurs on outdoor rinks and the St. Paul Winter Carnival with a snow-sculpting competition. Most of the events are free and some require a ticket, including Luminary Loppet, a walking, skiing or snowshoeing route on a frozen lake lined with 1,200 lights ($20). The winter celebration also focuses on climate change in talks, live podcasts and films on the subject. “Our cold, snowy winters shape our culture, and they are at risk as the climate continues to warm, so at the Great Northern, we want to motivate festivalgoers to take steps to preserve it,” said Kate Nordstrum, the executive and artistic director of the festival."

In addition to the likely humanitarian toll and the hit to U.S. standing in the world, any incursion into Mexico could worsen the same problems Republicans are trying to address. To the extent that the U.S. has succeeded in stemming illegal immigration and drugs in recent years, it has relied on Mexico’s close cooperation. Both Trump and President Biden have worked with Mexican officials to stop South and Central Americans from traveling to the U.S. through Mexico.

Mexico would almost certainly stop collaborating if the U.S. sent troops or let missiles fly. Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has said that talk of sending the U.S. military south of the border is “irresponsible” and “an offense to the people of Mexico, a lack of respect for our sovereignty.”

Representatives of the Trump, DeSantis and Haley campaigns did not respond to questions about using the military against Mexican cartels. A spokeswoman for Scott restated his support for the idea, but didn’t respond to questions about whether he would ask for Mexico’s approval before deploying the military there.

Of the 180 nations surveyed in the 2023 World Press Freedom Index, India sits at 161, a scant three places above Russia. Its position on the Academic Freedom Index has nose-dived since Mr. Modi took office, putting it on a course that sharply resembles those of other electoral autocracies. The Freedom in the World index has tracked a steady erosion of Indian citizens’ political rights and civil liberties. On the Economist Intelligence Unit’s Democracy Index, India has tumbled squarely into the ranks of “flawed democracies.”

A working paper from the Indian government dismisses such metrics as “perception-based.” Sadly, it is no “perception” that the government systematically harasses its critics by raiding the offices of think tanks, NGOs and media organizations, restricting freedom of entry and exit, and pressing nuisance lawsuits — most conspicuously against the opposition leader Rahul Gandhi, who was recently ejected from Parliament after his conviction on a ludicrous charge of having defamed everybody named “Modi.” It is no “perception” that Muslim history has been torn from national textbooks, cities with Islamic eponyms renamed and India’s only Muslim-majority state, Jammu and Kashmir, stripped of its autonomy.

Western commentators enthusing about the “new India” tend to breeze past such outrages as distractions from India’s economic growth and investment potential. But here too are troubling indicators. The share of women in the formal work force stands at around a paltry 20 percent and has shrunk during Mr. Modi’s tenure. The share of wealth held by the top 1 percent has grown since he took office and is now 40.5 percent, thanks to crony capitalism resembling the Russian oligarchy’s. Unemployment is rising, the cost of basic food is surging, and government investment in health care is stagnating. As for India’s readiness to partner on efforts to combat climate change — one of the Biden administration’s highest hopes — the Indian government has cracked down on climate activists and just removed evolution and the periodic table from the curriculum for under-16-year-olds in its ongoing assault on science.

The politics of Mr. Modi’s India are also affecting American communities, workplaces and campuses as the Indian diaspora in the United States grows. In Edison, N.J., marchers in the annual India Day parade last August drove a wheel loader, which resembles a bulldozer, bedecked with images of Mr. Modi and a far-right Indian government minister who has ordered the razing of Muslims’ homes and businesses, rendering such vehicles symbols of hate as provocative as a noose or a burning cross at a Klan rally. At Google, upper-caste Hindus tendentiously invoked “Hinduphobia” to rescind a speaking invitation to a Dalit activist, Thenmozhi Soundararajan, accusing her of hate speech. Those involved in a major academic conference criticizing Hindu nationalism were bombarded with rape and death threats. Across America there are now more than 200 chapters of the overseas arm of India’s fascist-inspired Hindu nationalist paramilitary organization, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or R.S.S., of which Mr. Modi is a longtime associate."

Two failures

Inflation. After decades of low inflation, Biden and his team erred on the side of a large Covid stimulus plan in 2021. They were more worried about the economy being too weak, as it has been for much of the 21st century, than being so strong that prices spiked. They were at least partly wrong."

Speaking at an annual gathering of world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly, Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, presented Russia’s invasion as a worldwide threat that would not stop at the borders of Ukraine. He added that Russia was weaponizing essentials like food and energy “not only against our country, but against all of yours, as well.”

President Biden also condemned Russia’s “naked aggression” and said the U.S. would continue to stand with the “brave people of Ukraine.” If the world appeases Russia, he asked, “can any member state in this body feel confident that they are protected? If we allow Ukraine to be carved up, is the independence of any nation secure?”

Unity is a frequent theme for the General Assembly, when the leaders and representatives of nearly 200 nations gather. But the world has become increasingly polarized: Russia’s war against Ukraine is pitting Moscow against the U.S. and its allies, while tensions between China and the United States are rising.

More weapons: As Zelensky spoke in New York City, defense ministers and other top officials met in Ramstein, Germany, to discuss providing military aid to Ukraine. The U.S. defense secretary said that Abrams battle tanks will arrive soon, bringing a powerful weapon to help Ukraine advance in its slow-moving counteroffensive."

He is also charged with a fourth count of obstructing an official proceeding. The most serious charge carries a maximum sentence of up to 20 years in prison. See the annotated indictment.

With overdose deaths on the rise, the state’s Medicaid program recently became the first in the nation to begin offering financial rewards to drug users who abstain from using stimulants like cocaine and methamphetamine. The program is an innovative, science-backed effort with many supporters, but it has raised some eyebrows.

“It’s really a brave choice of California to try this against potential backlash and misunderstanding,” said Catherine Teare, an associate director at the nonprofit California Health Care Foundation, noting that stimulant use is a particularly severe problem among the state’s growing homeless population. “This isn’t going to solve it,” she said, “but I think it’s well worth trying.”

There aren’t any targeted medications to combat addiction to stimulants, as there are for opioids and alcohol, so stimulant addictions are among the hardest to treat. That’s why state officials are banking on this pilot program to fight cocaine and methamphetamine abuse.

Deaths from these kind of stimulants in California quadrupled from 2011 to 2019, according to an analysis by the California Health Care Foundation. Emergency department visits related to amphetamines rose nearly 50 percent in two years, from 2018 to 2020, the analysis found."

Now all those plans have been scrapped. The White House announced on Tuesday that Mr. Biden would cut short an Asia-Pacific trip and return to Washington on Sunday after the Group of 7 summit in Japan for debt ceiling negotiations to ensure the United States does not run out of cash and default.

What the cancellation means, in the broadest of terms, is that America’s domestic politics is undermining American foreign policy at a crucial time, in a critical region. Analysts and diplomats warn that fears of an unreliable and dysfunctional America will now be revived in Asia and the Pacific, where the United States has only recently started to build momentum in its efforts to counter Chinese influence.

“It will reinforce lingering doubts about U.S. staying power,” said Hal Brands, a professor of global affairs at Johns Hopkins University. “And you can bet China will make hay of this — its message to countries in the region will be, ‘You can’t count on a country that can’t even perform basic functions of governance.’”"

Survivors described fleeing for their lives from a fast-moving “total inferno” that left the town of Lahaina in smoking ruins. Thousands of people filled evacuation shelters, and tourists continued a grim exodus to the airport.

Fueled by unusual conditions that included winds from a distant hurricane, the fire now ranks as one of the nation’s deadliest in decades. Flames burned with such intensity that at least a dozen people escaped into the Pacific Ocean, where they were later rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard. Firefighters continued to battle flare-ups yesterday.

The fire appeared to have been worsened by winds linked to a hurricane passing hundreds of miles away in the Pacific Ocean, though the exact causes were still unclear. Hawaii has battled a surge of fires in recent years, as wildfires have become more intense and frequent in the American West and beyond because of climate change."

Manhattan prosecutors are looking at TerraUSD and Luna, which are linked. (In a nutshell, when TerraUSD fell in value, the supply of Luna would go up, as part of a mechanism that was supposed to keep the price of TerraUSD stable.) In May, a flood of sell orders for TerraUSD overwhelmed the market for the digital currency and depressed the price of Luna. The markets for the two coins eventually collapsed.

The bulk of the TerraUSD sell orders appeared to come from one place, according to The Times: S.B.F.’s trading firm, Alameda, which had also bet against Luna. If things had gone as expected, Alameda would have reaped a huge profit."

He received key support from a political action committee tied to the carpenters union, which was seeking to block Jill Tokuda, a progressive state senator who was then the front-runner and was later elected to Congress.

When Covid hit in 2020, David Ige, who was then the governor, informally made Mr. Green the administration’s pandemic point man. But their relationship was not always harmonious, and the early call on the cruise lines fed perceptions that Mr. Green was prematurely campaigning to succeed Mr. Ige, who was prevented by term limits from running for re-election in 2022.

Eventually, the governor formalized Mr. Green’s role as Covid liaison. Armed with a whiteboard and raw data, he reestablished himself as the face of Hawaii’s response to the pandemic, pushing mandatory vaccines for public sector employees, indoor masking for businesses, and quarantines or proof of vaccination for travel among the islands. Aside from a few small protests outside his home, there was little of the public unrest that roiled other states.

In the spring of 2021, as infection rates dropped, a poll conducted by two local news organizations found that the lieutenant governor had a 63 percent approval rating, nearly three times that of Mr. Ige. A year later, Mr. Green defeated six other Democrats in the primary and won the general election easily.

As governor, he has stopped practicing medicine except as a volunteer; a state law that took effect in 2022 forbids governors from holding second jobs while in office. But he has made headlines several times for rendering care in emergencies. In July, Morning Consult reported that only two other governors had higher approval ratings from their constituents."

A missile built to sink ships exploded in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on Saturday, hitting a nine-story apartment building. As of yesterday, 30 people were confirmed killed, 79 were injured and at least 30 people remained unaccounted for. It was one of the largest losses of civilian lives far from the front line since the beginning of the war.

A week before, Russia had launched dozens of missiles across Ukraine in two waves of strikes that coincided with the Orthodox New Year. Deliberately or recklessly attacking civilian populations in this way is widely considered a war crime. It comes after months of Russian assaults on infrastructure targets that provide power, heat and water.

Immediately after the attack, pro-Russian news outlets and military bloggers claimed that the apartment building was not the target but had been struck by fragments of the missile after Ukrainian air defenses tried to intercept it. Ukrainian forces were quick to deny that, and evidence from the scene pointed to a direct strike on the building.

Location: Dnipro, a city nestled against the river of the same name, had a population of just under one million before the war began. Although targeted by Russian shelling, the city has never been occupied by Russian forces or been the scene of frontline fighting. The city has been home to displaced people who have flocked to its relative safety."

The author is not interviewing fresh arrivals but folks who seem to have been taking notes in the margins for decades. Sometimes the strain to get history just right shines through: One White House senior adviser looks right at the camera and says, “This sounds like something that Aaron Sorkin would want to write.”

As that example proves, Whipple shines when, like the documentarian he is, he lets people talk. This is most effective with true insiders (Christopher Liddell, Trump’s deputy chief of staff, tells of trying to ensure a transition come hell or high treason). Interviews with journalists and talking heads, on the other hand, add all the insight of a cable news panel. The result is not a lot of newsy nuggets about, for example, the messy withdrawal from Afghanistan. But in conversations with a talkative Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and others, Whipple proves adept at getting members of a relatively opaque administration to play the blame game in print.

No one is interviewed as extensively as Ron Klain, the White House chief of staff, who appears in the book more than anyone other than the president and his predecessor. Whipple has managed what seems to be a first: a two-year running conversation with a White House chief of staff, including real-time email reaction to events in Afghanistan. In many stories, Klain gets the last word, and readers get a front-row seat — even better than that accorded by Klain’s much-discussed Twitter feed — if not for the action, then at least for a spirited presentation of the White House’s case.

So what is the fight of Joe Biden’s life? The more accurate word might be “fights.” Whipple lists many, including Biden’s own “battle for the soul of the nation,” as his campaign had it, though the author highly ranks the confrontation with Russia. Without a unified theory on what rates as the primary skirmish of this presidency, Whipple works with what he’s got: the outputs — executive orders, speeches, spending bills — of the slow boring of hard boards. And the ultimate outcome of many of these is still in doubt."

Mr. Macron’s government is trying to balance pressure from a rising far right to get immigration under control, against France’s need for immigrant labor. Its bill reflects his long-stated willingness to streamline both admissions and deportations, fulfilling a promise he made during his re-election campaign earlier this year.

Recent incidents — including a schoolgirl’s killing by an illegal migrant and the disputed docking of a migrant rescue vessel — have also pushed the government to try to take the heat out of a combustible issue.

Immigration has long been a fixation of politics in France — the president’s proposal would be the country’s 29th immigration and asylum law in four decades — where politicians and commentators, particularly on the right, often describe a country fending off an out-of-control influx of migrants. In reality, France has a smaller proportion of immigrants in its population than most of its neighbors, and in the past decade, immigration has grown less there than in the rest of Europe."

With Covid disrupting normal urban life, it seemed much of the big money might focus on the financial advantages and leave the Big Apple.

Some wealthy finance types did move. But the buzz around finance moving to Miami seems to have died down. In fact, the population of Miami-Dade County actually fell between 2019 and 2022.

Ten times over 12 years, Pico Iyer accompanied the Dalai Lama across Japan. Inevitably, at every large public gathering, someone would ask what to do after having been disappointed by a dream not realized. The dreams themselves differed — peace in the Middle East, a reversal of climate change or hope for a relationship — but the disillusionment was always the same.

“Wrong dream!” the Dalai Lama would respond.

“The Half Known Life,” with this vignette at its center, takes the Dalai Lama’s sentiment to heart. How to reconcile our wishes and hopes with reality? Where does paradise really lie? What can a secular seeker learn from the world’s holiest places? In Iyer’s hands, the search for paradise, the way out of the ego, doubles as an internal journey. Skittering from the gardens of Iran’s holiest mosques to the car-free streets of North Korea’s capital, from the avenues of East Belfast to war-torn Kashmir’s Dal Lake houseboats, from the outback of aboriginal Australia to the Ethiopian chapels of Jerusalem, from the empty moonscape of Ladakh to the massive stone Buddhas of Sri Lanka, from the graveyards of Japan’s mountain temples to the burning ghats of Varanasi, this elliptical odyssey, graced with occasional notes of light, finds itself by dwelling in the shadows. The places we avoid, Iyer says, are “so often closer to us than the ones we eagerly seek out.”

No stranger to the travel genre, the prolific Iyer is after something more here. His chronicle, which begins with an appreciation of the sophistication, beauty and culture of Iran, becomes a requiem for a world — and an existence — estranged from itself. There are only two things he is afraid of, he tells us: serpents and heights; and there are plenty of both here, along with crypts, tombstones, graveyards, burning corpses and flickering lights, “an infinity of reflections” in “a treasure house of riddles.” A lonely, nostalgic and haunted quality emerges as Iyer casually intersperses bits of his personal history. There is a formula to many of the chapters: He touches down in a new place, checks into a lodging and finds a taxi or guide to take him to the next site. We meet his drivers, listen to their surprising conversation and extract unexpected wisdom. “The writer’s job,” Iyer opines, “is to dismantle the very notion of Other by showing how your hurts belong to me, as my hopes do to you.” But empathy is not the only thing going on; Iyer is also looking within. And as he looks, things get dizzier and dizzier.

Iyer is not a Buddhist, but he has a Buddhist sensibility. Born in Oxford and educated in elite English boarding schools, he is a secular writer with an eye for the spiritual. His book has the soft ring of a classic Buddhist meditation strategy: In order to understand the emptiness of the ego, one must first find the self as it appears. This might sound easy, but in practice it is incredibly frustrating. The more one tries to zero in on the self, the more elusive it becomes. The process is often likened to a dog chasing its own tail — round and round you go until the very giddiness of the process whirls you into an unexpected understanding. “The Half Known Life” brings this uncertainty to the fore. By the end of the book, Iyer wakes to a fog-drenched Varanasi, the holy Indian city of the dead. He can barely see 30 feet in front of him. Fires from burning bodies add smoke to the mist. We are in a “half known realm” filled with “ghostly towers and palaces” where the only paradise is a “candlelit back alleyway” that shows the way home. Iyer references Emily Dickinson and Herman Melville as he gathers his conclusions; both writers inferred that “a keen sense of all that could never be fathomed” is the way to paradise."

Unless America took major steps to rein in future deficits, they warned, a fiscal crisis could be expected within around two years.

Bowles described what he thought would happen: Foreigners would stop buying our debt. And then, he asked: “What happens to interest rates? What happens to the U.S. economy? The markets will absolutely devastate us.”

That was 12 years ago. At the time Bowles issued his warning, the interest rate on 10-year U.S. bonds was about 3.5 percent. Not much was done to reduce deficits, aside from a squeeze on discretionary federal spending that probably delayed economic recovery. But at the end of last week the 10-year rate, which has gone up substantially over the past year as the Fed raises rates to fight inflation, was … about 3.5 percent.

The point is that in the early 2010s, the last time we faced a potential crisis over the debt ceiling, there was an elite consensus that budget deficits were a severe, even existential threat. This consensus was, in retrospect, completely wrong. Yet it almost completely dominated the political conversation, to such an extent that, as Ezra Klein pointed out, the media abandoned the normal rules of reportorial neutrality and openly cheered proposals to cut Social Security and Medicare."

What stood out most were the strip’s imposing condominiums, hotels and beachy motels; many of them deserted and deemed unsafe.

As of Friday evening, Volusia County had ordered the evacuation of 27 condominiums and hotels, 22 of them in Daytona Beach Shores and five in New Smyrna Beach. They had been compromised by broken sea walls and water intrusion, leading authorities to evacuate thousands of residents, according to county officials. An additional 30 homes in Wilbur-by-the-Sea, an unincorporated community just south of Daytona Beach Shores, were teetering on the edge of the dunes.

“I’m going to reach out to McConnell and I want to say to the non-MAGA Republicans, ‘Work with us; we want to get some things done here,’” Mr. Schumer said in an interview on Monday in his Capitol leadership suite. “What gives us the opening is that they know embracing Trump and MAGA is a failure.

The agreement involved unfreezing $6 billion in Iranian oil revenue and dismissing federal charges against five Iranians. The deal was a result of two years of high-stakes talks and is part of a larger effort by the Biden administration to de-escalate tensions with Iran.

The Americans — Siamak Namazi, Emad Sharghi and Morad Tahbaz, as well as two others who have not been named at their families’ request — flew to Doha, the capital of Qatar, for a Cold War-style prisoner exchange with two of the five Iranians. The Americans are returning to the U.S., but three of the Iranians declined to return to Iran, according to U.S. officials.

The American prisoners had been jailed in Iran on unsubstantiated charges of spying, and some had been held for years in Evin Prison, one of the country’s most notorious detention centers. (Here’s what we know about them.)

News of the arrangement has generated intense criticism from Republicans who say that releasing billions in oil revenue amounts to paying a ransom and that it could lead to the taking of more hostages. Biden administration officials have said the agreement with Iran was the only way to win the release of the five Americans, and have denied that the deal indicates a major shift in the long-hostile relationship between the U.S. and Iran."

The travel industry “cares about getting their weather predictions right because weather affects everything,” said Amy McGovern, director of the National Science Foundation’s A.I. Institute for Research on Trustworthy A.I. in Weather, Climate and Coastal Oceanography at the University of Oklahoma.

Those better weather predictions rely on a type of artificial intelligence called machine learning, where in essence, a computer program is able to use data to improve itself. In this case, companies create software that uses historical and current weather data to make predictions. The algorithm then compares its predictions with outcomes and adjusts its calculations from there. By doing this over and over, the software makes more and more accurate forecasts.

The amount of data fed into these types of software is enormous. IBM’s modeling system, for example, integrates information from 100 other models. To that, it adds wind, temperature and humidity data from more than 250,000 weather stations on commercial buildings, cellphone towers and private homes around the globe. In addition, it incorporates satellite and radar reports from sources like the National Weather Service, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration. Some of the world’s most powerful computers then process all this information.

Here’s how all this may improve your future trips:

Safer and calmer flights

The skies are getting bumpier. According to a recent report from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, “severe turbulence at typical airplane cruising altitudes could become two to three times more common.”

Knowing where those disturbances are and how to avoid them “is mission-critical for airlines,” Ms. Bachstein said."

Molly Rinker, whose nickname was Old Mom, and who was one of the era’s fabled spies, reportedly tucked bits of information about British troop movements into balls of yarn. Who would suspect an aging matron, placidly knitting socks at a scenic overlook, of tossing message-laced skeins to the patriots? Knitting’s benign reputation allowed her to subvert the very conventions she appeared to uphold.

The French had their “tricoteuses,” which translates to women knitters (they have a word for that!), particularly those who, during the Reign of Terror, sat before the guillotines bearing grim witness to public executions. You may recall Madame Defarge from “A Tale of Two Cities,” whose stitches formed a Reaper’s roster of the condemned. Her real-life counterparts were equally complex, a mix of feminist hero and vengeful villain. Many (presumably savoring l’ironie) were said to knit liberty caps as the heads rolled: those red, conical hats with the point folded forward that represented freedom from tyranny. Marianne, a national symbol of France, is often depicted in a liberty cap. So, for reasons I cannot determine, is Papa Smurf.

Sojourner Truth offered a different twist on yarn and femininity during the Civil War, posing for photographs with her knitting, a nod to her belief that education and industry were the key to her community’s advancement. Decades later, when troops in World War I were dying by the tens of thousands from an epidemic of trench foot, caused by persistently wet toes, it was knitters to the rescue. The best defense was to change your socks — a lot — but factories of the time couldn’t handle the load, so home crafters produced them. I’m not saying we won that war because of women’s knitting, but I’m not sure we would’ve won without it.

Another activist first lady, Eleanor Roosevelt, was rarely without her knitting and began the Knit for Defense campaign during World War II. Similarly to Old Mom Rinker, female spies of the time used knitting as cover, one even parachuting behind enemy lines, then using her needles to transport secret code.

Today’s public knitters — and crocheters — are arguably more radical, perhaps in part because making something with your own hands almost by definition pushes back against dehumanizing technology and consumer culture. Knitters have mobilized against nuclear proliferation and the decimation of coral reefs. They have made blankets to welcome refugees; crafted tiny sweaters to save oil spill-damaged penguins; knit “temperature scarves” whose rows and colors document climate change; stitched for racial justice; sent handmade uteri to Congress in support of abortion rights (an especially apt political statement, since knitting needles were notoriously used, to women’s peril, in back-alley abortions). During the second Iraq war, a knitter in Denmark swathed a tank in a massive, homey knit blanket. The Russian feminist punk group Pussy Riot famously masked their identities beneath brightly colored knit balaclavas while performing songs such as “Putin’s Pissed Himself” and “Kill the Sexist.”"

Now they are headed to Washington for a major summit hosted by President Biden — the latest diplomatic drive by a major foreign power seeking to strengthen its ties to Africa, a continent whose geopolitical clout has grown greatly in the past decade.

An international scramble for military, commercial and diplomatic interests in Africa, long dominated by China, has expanded in recent years to include other powers like Russia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. In this intense competition, the U.S. has often lagged behind, analysts say — a decline the Biden administration hopes to reverse with the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit that starts on Tuesday.

He then tells her that the exam she needed to pass in order to enter their “working group” was sex.

Tomorrow, King Charles III will be crowned at Westminster Abbey. It will be the U.K.’s first coronation in 70 years.

Charles has been king since his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, died seven months ago. Since ascending the throne, he has worked to make the monarchy more accessible, forward-looking and inclusive, royal watchers say.

As king, Charles faces a daunting task. He is walking a tightrope between tradition and modernity, epitomized in his personal life. He’s divorced — and remarried. He eats healthy and cares about climate change. But tomorrow’s rituals will be a reminder that, in a secular, multiethnic, digital-age society, the crown is fundamentally an anachronism.

The British people, some of whom are more preoccupied with the spiraling cost-of-living crisis, have not necessarily turned against the idea of a king. But many, especially younger people, find the trappings of royalty increasingly irrelevant."

Speaking publicly for the first time in two days, a visibly angry Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, denounced as “blackmail” a weekend rebellion by the Wagner mercenary group even as he defended his response and hinted at leniency for those who took part.

Throughout the day, the Kremlin had sought to project an air of normalcy, unity and stability, despite Putin’s absence from public view after perhaps the most serious crisis of his two-decade rule. When he finally emerged, the Russian leader skirted a host of unanswered questions left by the revolt.

Putin did, however, indirectly address a question many had been asked since the mutiny began: Why was it not crushed, swiftly and mercilessly, by Russia’s much larger military? “On my direct instructions, steps were taken to avoid a lot of bloodshed,” he said. “This took time, including to give those who made a mistake a chance to change their minds.”

Response: Prigozhin, until recently a vital Putin ally, said in an 11-minute voice memo that his mutiny was not an attempt to seize power, but rather a protest of the Russian military’s plan to absorb his forces. He renewed his sharp criticism of Russia’s military leaders."

Two meetings — between the U.S. House speaker and the president of Taiwan and between the leaders of France and China — are highlighting the West’s delicate diplomacy with China amid rising tensions.

In China: President Emmanuel Macron of France traveled to Beijing to “relaunch” a strategic partnership between Europe and China. He also plans to urge Xi Jinping, China’s leader, to play a “major role” in bringing peace to Ukraine.

Macron, who will meet with Xi today, is determined to carve out a more conciliatory position toward China than the American one and to convince Xi to speak with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.

If the French leader can exploit daylight between China and Russia over Russia’s war in Ukraine — which appears unlikely given the two countries’ declaration of a “no-limits” friendship — he will have achieved something that is broadly in America’s strategic interest: a faster end to the war and a weakening of the Chinese-Russian bond."

Both of those two things will cause the economy to slow substantially.”

If Israel’s democratic institutions are undermined, investors and executives contended, it will keep blue-chip customers and investors at bay. And if a company has difficulty attracting customers, it will have the same problem with talent.

Many Israeli-led companies, including Wiz, are already based in the United States and keep a subsidiary in Israel because that makes it easier to appeal to investors and employees. Israeli tech executives who live in the United States often return when their children reach school age so they can acclimate to Israeli culture and serve in the military.

In 2018, for example, China cracked down on Marxist student groups and labor organizers, possibly because — as the labor scholar and sociologist Eli Friedman has noted — the young activists embodied “the Marxist principles the C.C.P. has long since abandoned in practice.” Likewise, Beijing has for years emphasized the sanctity of national sovereignty and noninterference in a country’s domestic affairs, yet has provided diplomatic cover for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Leading Chinese intellectuals openly acknowledge the difficulty of reconciling what China says with what it does. “Even we don’t believe much of what we say,” the Chinese economist Yao Yang, who is known for his pragmatic views, has said. “Our goal is not to defeat liberalism, but instead to say that what we have can be as good as what you have.” Jiang Shigong, a legal scholar and apologist for Mr. Xi’s political philosophy, has written that “‘socialism’ is not ossified dogma, but instead an open concept awaiting exploration and definition.”

China’s long-term ambitions are difficult to know with certainty, and they can change. But it is far from clear that it can — or even seeks to — replace the United States as the world’s dominant power.

Mr. Xi and the C.C.P. apparently see the United States as trying to keep China perpetually subordinate and vulnerable, opposing whatever China does or advocates in an international system that Beijing believes favors the United States and developed democracies. But at a minimum, China seems more intent on modifying aspects of a system under which it has prospered — making it safer for autocracy — rather than replacing it.

Mr. Xi often couches this effort in his political slogans like the “China dream” and a “shared future for humankind.” But there is continuing debate in China over what these visions really mean and what costs and risks China should accept in seeking global leadership. China’s overseas development largess, for example, is limited by the imperative of addressing its own persistent development needs at home, research by the scholar Min Ye has shown. Same for other key Chinese strategies for widening its influence: Its efforts to internationalize the renminbi and reduce dollar dominance are constrained by the tight grip it keeps on the currency’s value, as well as other capital controls. These policies help stabilize its economy and prevent capital flight, but they limit the renminbi’s global appeal."

For the last two decades the New York designer Thom Browne has been trying to change all that: first, by shrinking the proportions of his men’s suits to demand a reassessment; next, by erasing gender boundaries, and then by creating so many variations on the theme, he effectively transformed the little gray suit into a Rorschach test that contained multitudes.

On Monday in Paris, however, he took it to a new level: the couture.

Every few weeks, a light show featuring the blue and yellow Ukrainian flag — and occasionally a Ukrainian-language profanity about the Russian president, Vladimir Putin — is beamed onto the white facade of the Russian Embassy in Washington. Russia has fought back with a big spotlight, umbrellas to obstruct the projections and illuminations of its own, such as two giant white Z’s, a nationalist Russian symbol of the war effort.

This is the strange new normal around Russia’s main diplomatic outpost in the U.S., a scene of protests, spy games and general weirdness amid the most hostile relations between the U.S. and Russia in decades. The Russian ambassador, Anatoly Antonov, has called the embassy compound, where in recent years as many as 1,2000 Russians have worked, “a besieged fortress.”

The embassy’s personnel may be among Washington’s least welcome residents, but Biden administration officials are glad they are there to maintain diplomatic ties, they say. Kicking out the Russians entirely would mean an end to America’s diplomatic presence in Moscow, which, among other things, works to assist U.S. citizens imprisoned in Russia.

Students objected to a number of the judge’s views and court rulings. Before he became a judge, he defended Louisiana’s same-sex marriage ban, for example. In addition, he wrote an opinion denying a transgender inmate’s motion to be referred to by feminine pronouns in court proceedings.

Robust protest should be welcome in the academy, and it is entirely appropriate to ask any judge difficult questions during the question and answer session after a speech. But protests that go so far as to shout down or disrupt speeches or events aren’t free speech but rather mob censorship.

This is an ancient principle of American liberty. My right to protest does not encompass a right to silence or drown out another person. As the abolitionist Frederick Douglass wrote in 1860 after an antislavery event was disrupted in Boston by a violent mob, “There can be no right of speech where any man, however lifted up, or however humble, however young, or however old, is overawed by force, and compelled to suppress his honest sentiments.”

He continued, “Equally clear is the right to hear. To suppress free speech is a double wrong. It violates the rights of the hearer as well as those of the speaker. It is just as criminal to rob a man of his right to speak and hear as it would be to rob him of his money.” By shouting down Judge Duncan, the Stanford protesters violated his right to speak and the attending students’ right to hear his speech.

But I’m less interested in what happened than why it did. This isn’t the first disruption incident in recent years at an elite American law school. Last March, students at Yale Law School attempted to disrupt an event featuring Kristen Waggoner, then the general counsel of Alliance Defending Freedom. (Disclosure: I’m a former senior counsel for A.D.F.) Less than two weeks earlier, students at what is now the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco, shouted down a former Cato Institute lawyer, Ilya Shapiro, so completely that he couldn’t deliver his prepared remarks."

What happened?

SVB, founded in California in 1983, became one of the country’s 20 largest banks mostly by lending money to start-ups. SVB was sometimes willing to back start-ups that more traditional banks were not — and some of those companies went on to great success.

SVB’s problems date to 2021, when many technology start-ups were flush with cash and deposited large amounts of it with the bank. SVB, in turn, tried to increase its profits by investing those deposits elsewhere. But as the Federal Reserve increased interest rates to fight inflation over the past two years, SVB’s investments began to lose value. (Kevin Roose’s column helpfully tells the longer version of the story.)"

U.C.L.A. and my alma mater, U.C. Berkeley, each jumped from 20th to tie for 15th place overall, and were once again ranked as the best public universities in the country. U.C. Davis rose from 38th to 28th place, where it is now on par with U.C. San Diego and the University of Southern California.

I’m just seeing that it’s about me. So I must be bad.”

She decided to dedicate her life to one pursuit: “To not be hated,” she said.

Ms. Koch, 47, is the daughter of Charles Koch, 87, the billionaire industrialist, climate change boogeyman and far-right political force. His wealth is estimated at roughly $66 billion. Ms. Koch is named after her mother, who goes by Liz. The family is close — everyone spent Christmas together in Las Vegas, staying at the Wynn resort and taking in a mentalist show. But Ms. Koch, at least by her account, has been driven to the brink of insanity by her last name.

In a 2007 essay for Smith Magazine, she described her young adulthood as “panic attacks and meltdowns and doctors and pharmaceuticals and terrifying my parents and staring down that dark well of nothing you do will ever be good enough you privileged waste of flesh.” A couple of years later, she lied to classmates at Syracuse University, where she was working on an M.F.A. in fiction, insisting that her name was pronounced “kotch,” no relation to those “cokes,” the ones they may have read sinister things about.

Ms. Koch’s anguish may strike you as entirely understandable. Money can be corrosive, especially for the generation that didn’t make it."

I don’t have a proper night stand and I don’t usually read before bedtime. However, my metaphorical night stand includes “Moby-Dick,” “Don Quixote,” three of Virginia Woolf’s lesser-known novels (“The Voyage Out,” “Night and Day” and “The Years”) and the complete work of Beatrix Potter. I listen to the audiobook of one of these books at bedtime. As I’m familiar with the texts, I don’t ever worry about missing something while falling asleep.

What’s the last great book you read?

I read “A Change of Climate,” by Hilary Mantel, for the first time last year, and right away reread it twice. It’s an early to midcareer novel by Mantel, which is, unfairly and yet inevitably, overshadowed by her later work. “A Change of Climate” is on a short list of novels that I keep together as regular rereads, along with J.M. Coetzee’s “Life & Times of Michael K,” Edward P. Jones’s “The Known World,” William Trevor’s “Fools of Fortune” and V. S. Naipaul’s “A Bend in the River”: books that tackle many shades of evil and goodness, none of which fits neatly into any ideology and all of which challenge ready-made narratives. They are not comforting or enchanting; rather, written out of a dire kind of clarity, they are novels that leave no space for wishful thinking.

Has a book ever brought you closer to another person, or come between you?

The first time I met Edmund White, in 2016, we started talking about Elizabeth Bowen’s “The House in Paris,"" which was important for both of us for different reasons. It would not be an exaggeration to say that we recognized the kindred spirit in each other right at that moment, and we have not stopped talking since then. At the beginning of the pandemic, Edmund and I started a two-person book club, and over the past three years, we’ve read a long list of books. We meet every day (nearly every day) on Skype at 5 p.m., taking turns to read aloud passages we love, always pretending to be surprised if we underline the same sentence.

What’s your favorite book to assign to and discuss with your students at Princeton?

Marilynne Robinson’s “Housekeeping.” I once asked some students how fast they could read, and one of them said she could cover 100 pages in an hour, so I decided to use “Housekeeping” to teach the students how to do slow reading. (Books written to be consumed at one sitting or in a day don’t interest me.) We read a chapter a week, and the students keep an extensive reading journal. They read not by scanning the text or summarizing the gist of a chapter or making conclusive and/or judgmental statements. Rather, they read word by word, sentence by sentence, and they ponder over an unfamiliar word choice, a fleeting gesture, the shadow of an image, and the ripple of a sentence seen in the following sentence. The collection of their thoughts, observations and questions is very touching. It’s a testament to the art of reading with not only five senses but also with memory and imagination. And I hope it’s the most important thing I can teach my students: not merely the crafts of writing but the importance of paying close attention, to the world in a book and to the world beyond a book."

What began with Washington’s attempt to counter Chinese influence with America’s imprimatur has now prompted an apparent shift in New Zealand policy and created a project of something resembling separate nationhood for the Cook Islands, even as its residents remain New Zealand citizens.

The Cook Islands’ prime minister, Mark Brown, said in an interview that the country now planned to apply for full membership in the International Monetary Fund “at least by next year” and that his diplomats were “talking to key, critical people” about U.N. membership."

“We’re going to have to bring a group of Democrats together that is willing to work and meet him halfway,” Mr. Manchin said of Mr. McCarthy in an interview, adding that he has been in conversations with centrists in the House who could be part of such a coalition. “I think we all know that we’re going to vote for the debt ceiling.

It promises to put Hungary at the center of a wrenching and, for some, highly profitable green transition, with electric cars leading the way.

But residents in Mikepercs, a Fidesz stronghold in eastern Hungary, are seething over the arrival on nearby farmland of bulldozers and dump trucks preparing the way for the Chinese plant. Many worry the project would create pollution, drain their water supply and bring an influx of Chinese and other foreign workers."

The fallout from weeks of storms is dramatic and widespread. Residents of the town of Montecito, in Santa Barbara County, were ordered to evacuate because of floods and the danger of mudslides. Rivers overflowed, trees were uprooted and ocean waves destroyed homes and businesses. Even in the Los Angeles area, usually sunny and parched, streets were flooding. While the state should receive some dry weather today, forecasters said, another wave of rain is expected on Saturday.

California has a history of floods: In 1862, the governor-elect took a rowboat to his own inauguration because Sacramento was so deep in floodwaters. The intense storms now reflect, in part, a warming climate, which brings a heightened risk of storms that are more intense and destructive. The enduring question in California of how to tame floods — or find ways to ease the negative effects of ferocious storms — has a new urgency.

“For 20 years or longer, policymakers in California have been trying to bring the state along,” my colleague Shawn Hubler, a National correspondent based in Sacramento, told me. “But it hasn’t happened fast enough. Now climate change has caught up with us.”"

Yet for the last week, ever since the announcement that he was leaving the brand after nearly eight years, I haven’t been able to stop thinking that we will miss him more than we have yet imagined.

And that his departure is yet another example of the bind fashion has created for itself, with the constant churn of designers, constant reinvention of brands, constant production of new stuff. With the addiction to the immediate high that is the new! And different! And next!

Whether you liked what Mr. Michele did or not, there was no denying he had a point of view, and it changed not just how people dressed but the whole trajectory of fashion. That’s a rare achievement, and one that has a value all its own.

Coco Chanel did it, when she tossed the corset and started making little bouclé suits that fit like sweaters. Christian Dior did it, with the New Look. Yves Saint Laurent, with the subversive chic of Le Smoking. Cristóbal Balenciaga, with his purist architecture. More recently, Giorgio Armani did it with his deconstructed power suiting, and Martin Margiela, with his deconstructed ideas of beauty. They created their own vernacular that was then absorbed into fashion writ large, and from there into closets everywhere."

On the eve of the Biennale, Lokko was busy negotiating a small crisis of her own: Last week she criticized Italy for denying entry visas for three members of her curatorial team from Ghana, and said that one additional member was still awaiting a response.

Daniela d’Orlandi, the Italian ambassador in Ghana, said that while Italy considered “the focus on Africa of this year’s edition of La Biennale in Venice very valuable,” it had a responsibility to enact the European Union’s visa code, which, she wrote in a statement to The New York Times, “imposes an assessment not of the purpose of the trip or the reliability of the invitees, but the possession of the requirements envisaged by each applicant.”

She said she was not at liberty to reveal the details of the individual cases, but “that if these are not satisfied we are unable to issue the related visa.”"

The projects I described reduce fire risk through a labor-intensive process that draws partly on Indigenous traditions, and were carried out by two Indigenous-owned companies. But I also headed east, to Nelson, where the municipal fire service is doing similar work in the surrounding forest while also working with homeowners to make their properties less vulnerable to fire.

The green landscape of Nelson is a sharp contrast to the brown, arid landscape of the Central Okanagan around Kelowna. Jeff Hebert, the fire chief in Nelson, described it as “interior rainforest.”"

Lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives voted yesterday to remove Speaker Kevin McCarthy from his leadership position. The vote was instigated by a group of hard-liners from his own Republican Party.

It was the first time in the modern history of the House of Representatives that such a vote passed. The House speaker is second in line to the president after the vice president.

The vote passed 216-210.

The effort to oust the speaker, led by Representative Matt Gaetz, was incited by McCarthy’s reliance last weekend on Democrats to pass a temporary spending bill to keep the government open until mid-November. The rebellion prompted an extraordinary Republican-against-Republican debate on the House floor over McCarthy’s future before the final vote. There was no groundswell of support from Democrats to give the Republican leader an easy way out.

Background: In January, McCarthy made concessions to hard-line conservatives to get elected as speaker, allowing any member to move to vacate the position — virtually assuring this day would come."

How do you feel about the results that have been announced so far? What do you think they mean for you, your community, your state and our nation as a whole?

Though control of Congress still hinges on races that are too close to call, by early Wednesday it was fairly clear that Democrats had defied predictions, winning dozens of key House, Senate and governors’ races across the country and forestalling a “red wave” that Republicans said would define one of the most consequential midterm campaigns in recent memory. We will continue to update this post, but you can also follow the live report.

In “Five Takeaways From a Red Wave That Didn’t Reach the Shore,” Blake Hounshell summarizes the lessons of the 2022 midterms so far. Here are the first two paragraphs of each of these “takeaways”; please read the full article to learn more.

The Democratic base showed up. The biggest question hanging over Democrats all year was just who, exactly, would show up to vote for them. In a typical midterm election, like 2010 and 2014, turnout drops by about 20 percentage points from a presidential year. But turnout smashed all records in 2018, when voters repudiated Mr. Trump and Democrats retook the House. So far, preliminary research by the Democratic data firm Catalist suggests that this year looks much more like 2018 than it does the sleepy affairs that took place under former President Barack Obama. Many analysts now think the United States may have reached a new plateau of permanently high participation, stoked by each party’s fear of the other side. Abortion put Democrats in the fight. Throughout much of 2021 and the first half of 2022, Republicans appeared poised for shellacking-level gains in Congress and beyond. Then came the Supreme Court’s bombshell decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, overturning a 50-year precedent that many Americans had taken for granted. Suddenly, Democrats had found an issue to rally their base around. Two months later, when voters in conservative Kansas emphatically rejected a ballot measure to ban abortion, many saw a potential game-changer in the making. Democratic governors like Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan positioned themselves as bulwarks of abortion rights, while liberal groups poured hundreds of millions of dollars into ads highlighting the far-right positions many Republicans took to win their primaries. Trump saddled Republicans with weak candidates. Often, Democrats got the opponents they desired. And the Republican Party leadership was just as often confounded and frustrated by the choices its own voters made. G.O.P. leaders aggressively courted centrist governors like Doug Ducey of Arizona, Larry Hogan of Maryland and Chris Sununu of New Hampshire to run for Senate — to little avail. Mr. Trump played kingmaker from Mar-a-Lago, demanding that candidates pay fealty to his lies about the 2020 election being stolen. Republican primary voters sided overwhelmingly with Mr. Trump, leading Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, to fret about the “quality” of his party’s nominees. Inflation dominated, as Democrats grasped for a response. Again and again, voters told pollsters that soaring prices for gasoline, groceries and housing were their No. 1 concern by far. And Democrats grasped for a clear, consistent response to Republican attacks. The White House first tried denial: Administration officials argued that inflation was a “transitory” phenomenon, a word that would come to haunt many a Democrat months later. Then blame: When Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent oil prices rocketing upward, Mr. Biden and other Democrats tried to brand inflation as “Putin’s price hike.” The country is as closely divided as ever. The chief force in American politics remains its deep partisan divide. There were indeed some ticket-splitters on Tuesday, but in general Democrats turned out en masse for Democrats, and Republicans for Republicans. In years past, Mr. Biden’s low approval ratings and inflation stuck at 40-year-highs might have augured a convincing drubbing for his party. Harry Truman lost 55 House seats in his first midterms; Bill Clinton lost 53; Barack Obama lost 63. That kind of rebuke didn’t happen to Mr. Biden. It is rarely how American politics works anymore. There are fewer true swing voters than ever — and a dwindling number of swingable races.

Students, read the entire article, then tell us:

How do you feel about the results of the midterm elections that have been reported so far? Surprised? Excited? Angry? Worried? Something else? Why?

What races, issues or candidates did you care about most? Why?

If you are American, who was elected in your state? What ballot initiatives were approved or rejected? What is your reaction these results and why? What impact will they have on you and the communities you are a part of?

Which details of the voting results seem especially significant or interesting to you? Why? What do you think those results say?

Did your friends and family who were eligible to vote go to the polls on Tuesday? Why or why not? Do you think you will vote when you are eligible?

Did you know that Generation Z has won its first seat in Congress? Maxwell Alejandro Frost, a 25-year-old Democrat, won in Florida’s 10th Congressional District, and focused on issues important to many young voters: gun violence, climate change, abortion rights and Medicare for all. How engaged do you think your generation is in politics now? How do you think you will make your voices heard in future elections?

The Times writes that Tuesday’s elections show that “the chief force in American politics remains its deep partisan divide.” Do you see political divisions in your own life, whether in your family, at your school, in your neighborhood, or in any other communities you belong to? What do you think Americans should do about this divide?

How important do you think this election is? What do the results mean for our nation, in your view? What do you predict will happen, whether in the days and weeks ahead, in 2024, or even beyond? Why?

What worries you about the future of America? What gives you hope? Why?

Today, much of Ystrad Fflur is just a memory save for a grand stone Romanesque arch nearly 25 feet tall, the foundation outline of the abbey and the graves of 11 Welsh princes laid to rest next to one another. Nevertheless, when you stand in the grounds of the abbey and cast your eye around the wide, beautiful Tywi River valley that envelops it, it is easy to imagine just how influential this place once was.

It was here, sometime around 1350, that the monks received a commission from a wealthy local man to create a written record of the Welsh legends and folklore that had been passed down by poets, going back perhaps as far as the sixth century."

The possibility of this country, the promise, is based on a union mutually beneficial even as it contains multitudes of difference.

Under a “Swissness” law, national symbols can be used to promote chocolate only when the milk it contains is sourced exclusively from Switzerland, as well as 80 percent of all other raw materials too. For milk-based products, the processing and manufacturing must also take place in Switzerland, according to the law — the latest version of which came into effect in 2017. There are exceptions for products like cacao, which is grown in humid climates."

In a news release, Hindsbo, 49, said she was “beyond excited” to make the move, adding that “some of my greatest experiences encountering art” occurred at the museum, housed in a former power station on the bank of the River Thames.

The directorship of Tate Modern is one of the European art world’s highest-profile roles, with the museum expected to regularly stage blockbuster exhibitions of contemporary and modern art. Under Morris’s leadership, it’s hosted acclaimed shows including a sold-out Cézanne retrospective, a career-spanning exhibition of the British artist Steve McQueen’s video pieces and an exploration of work by African American artists during the civil rights era."

Twenty years ago, he was a preppy Beltway habitué and impishly libertarian magazine writer; a wryly affectionate account of Al Sharpton in Liberia that he wrote for Esquire was nominated for a National Magazine Award. Now he’s the sneering, conspiracy-obsessed host of what The New York Times called possibly “the most racist show in the history of cable news.”

As The Times wrote, there’s a long-running debate about “whether Mr. Carlson’s show is merely lucrative theater or an expression of his true values.” By most accounts, Carlson shares Donald Trump’s deep cultural resentments. But as an explosive new court filing in Dominion Voting Systems’ defamation lawsuit against Fox News demonstrates, in trying to explain why Carlson and many of his colleagues do what they do, we shouldn’t underestimate simple greed.

The brief, a motion for summary judgment in a case stemming from Fox’s egregiously false claims of Dominion-abetted election fraud, offers a portrait of extravagant cynicism. It reveals how obsessed Carlson and other leading Fox News figures were with audience share, and their fear of being outflanked by even further-right outlets like Newsmax.

“It’s remarkable how weak ratings make good journalists do bad things,” Bill Sammon, a Fox senior vice president until 2021, is quoted as saying. It’s a line that would fall flat on “Succession” because it’s too absurdly on the nose."

Initially, he went after Mr. Ramaswamy as the next best thing, saying that he “sounds like ChatGPT” and likening him to Barack Obama; Mr. Ramaswamy reminded Mr. Christie that the then-governor notoriously hugged Mr. Obama in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, just before the 2012 election.

Around an hour in, Mr. Baier finally invoked Mr. Trump — “the elephant not in the room” — and his indictments, to the boos of the crowd. This led to the night’s most memorable visual, when the moderators asked for a show of hands from everyone who would support Mr. Trump as nominee if he were convicted at trial. The hand raise began with Mr. Ramaswamy and moved across the stage like a sluggish wave at a stadium, stopping at Mr. Christie.

The Trump segment was the liveliest of the night, both for the candidates and for members of the audience, who at one point tried to drown out Mr. Christie until Mr. Baier asked them to please let them “get through this section.”

This apologetic, I-guess-we-have-to-do-this approach to Jan. 6 was a disservice, if not a surprise given the audience pressures on Fox. Yes, the moderators focused on serious issues, including climate change, which is often absent at presidential debates. But if there was enough time to ask about the conservative country anthem “Rich Men North of Richmond” — in the very first question — there was enough time to talk in depth about an attack on the Capitol. When a faction of members and supporters of a party try to overturn a democratic election, debate moderators need to recognize that that’s a big issue for that party, whether the fans boo or not.

But Mr. Trump was not there to make his own noise, which left more room for one of the main goals of a first debate: to let candidates introduce themselves to a broader audience."

“They have a very different vision for America,” Mr. Biden said in a speech at Prince George’s Community College in Largo, Md., just outside the nation’s capital, where he held up a copy of budget plans by House Republicans. “Their plan, MAGAnomics, is more extreme than anything America has ever seen before.”

Mr. Biden trained his criticism on Republicans who are threatening to shut down the federal government if their plans are not enacted.

The political dynamic is expected to strain the credibility of the United States at the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which begin on Monday in Marrakesh. Ms. Yellen is expected to press European governments to provide more funding for Ukraine and push creditors like China to relieve the debts of poor countries, including many African nations.

The meetings are taking place amid heightened global uncertainty because of the weekend attacks that Hamas waged upon Israel, which threaten to spiral into a regional conflict.

“The war for talent has really been exceptional in the last 24 months in tech,” Ms. Smith said in an interview. “So when we see layoffs happening, whether it’s at Twitter or Meta or other companies, it’s definitely an opportunity to go after some of the very high-caliber talent we know they hire.”"

As evidence, I present two remarkable charts, which are my versions of charts made by the Center on the Economics and Demography of Aging at the University of California, Berkeley.

The charts show a big increase since 1960 in the consumption of goods and services by people over 60, with the biggest increase among people 75 and older. The charts show average consumption per individual, not total consumption by the (growing) cohort of the old.

It’s great that fewer old people are dying in poverty. And there’s no reason that a rich country like the United States can’t support its old people while also attending to other important priorities, such as young people.

But it’s also true that a lot of tax dollars are going to finance the lifestyles of some retirees who really don’t need the money. Rightly or wrongly, Congress is choosing spending on the old over spending on the young. “Many people are inclined to view Social Security benefits as something they are owed since they contributed to the system,” the economists Melissa Kearney and Luke Pardue write in a new paper commissioned by the Aspen Economic Strategy Group. “In contrast, children have not paid into any system and there is no similar promise — either implicit or explicit — from our federal government to provide materially for children.” Spending by all levels of government, including state and local, was nearly twice as high per capita on the old as on the young in 2019, they calculate."

It’s hard to craft clear and incisive questions on these complex and emerging topics for survey research, especially since “woke” is notoriously ill-defined. Last week, the conservative writer Bethany Mandel became the subject of considerable ridicule on social media after she was unable to concisely define the term in an interview. She’s not the only one. Apparently, there’s a “woke” part of the federal budget. “Wokeness” was even faulted for the Silicon Valley Bank collapse.

But while the definition of “woke” may be up for debate, there’s no doubt that the term is trying to describe something about the politics of today’s highly educated, young “new” left, especially on cultural and social issues like race, sex and gender.

As with the original New Left in the 1960s, the emergence of this new left has helped spark a reactionary moment on the right. It has split many liberals from their usual progressive allies. And it has helped power the rise of Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has done more to associate himself with fighting “woke” than any other politician. Like it or not, “woke” will shape this year’s Republican primary.

What’s woke?

The new left emerged in the aftermath of Barack Obama’s re-election in 2012. At the time, liberalism seemed utterly triumphant. Yet for young progressives, “hope” and “change” had given way to the realization that Mr. Obama’s presidency hadn’t cured income inequality, racial inequality or climate change. These dynamics opened a space for a new left, as young progressives started to reach for more ambitious politics, just as the triumph of the Obama coalition gave progressives the confidence to embrace ideas that would have been unimaginable in the Bush era.

A decade later, this new left is everywhere. On economic issues, there has been the Bernie Sanders campaign and calls for Medicare for all; democratic socialism; and the Green New Deal. On race, there has been the Black Lives Matter movement; kneeling in protest during the national anthem; and defund the police. On gender and sex, there has been the Me Too movement and the sharing of preferred pronouns and more."

Mr. Biden, speaking to members of a steamfitters union, sought to take credit for the strength of the labor market, moderating inflation and news from the Commerce Department on Thursday morning that the economy had grown at an annualized pace of 2.9 percent at the end of last year. In contrast, he cast House Republicans and their economic policy proposals as roadblocks to continued improvement.

“At the time I was sworn in, the pandemic was raging and the economy was reeling,” Mr. Biden said before ticking through the actions he had taken to aid the recovery. Those included $1.9 trillion in pandemic and economic aid; a bipartisan bill to repair and upgrade roads, bridges, water pipes and other infrastructure; and a sweeping industrial policy bill to spur domestic investment in advanced manufacturing sectors like semiconductors and speed research and development to seed new industries."

915,How does life expectancy differ among ethnic and racial groups?

What is so striking from the graphs is the significantly worse outcomes for Native Americans — both the cumulative U.S. Covid death rates and the U.S. life expectancy. (See Stat Nuggets below.)

Despite the fact that Native Americans have been vaccinated at rates greater than Black or Hispanic Americans, the Covid case rates, hospitalizations and deaths of Native Americans have outpaced any other ethnic or racial group that is tracked by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Times article “How the Pandemic Shortened Life Expectancy in Indigenous Communities,” published on Sept. 1, 2022, gives more details on the discrepancy in health statistics. For example, during the first two years of Covid, the life expectancy of Native Americans dropped six and a half years to about 65 years, which is about the same as the life expectancy in Afghanistan, Congo and Papua New Guinea.

Since vaccination rates were relatively high in the Native American community, why is the death rate high and resulting life expectancy low? Reasons include poverty, medical conditions (obesity and diabetes), inadequate access to health care, cultural and language barriers, inadequate infrastructure (internet, electricity and running water) and crowded multigenerational homes.

We thank all of the students who shared their headlines. Here are some shout-outs for great headlines: “Life Expectancy by Race: How Have COVID Disparities Affected This?” by Jesenia of Perth Amboy High School in New Jersey and “Hispanic and Native Communities Hurt the Most with the Aftermath of the Pandemic” by Giana of Valley Stream North High School in New York. Plus, there are three headlines from Eaglecrest High School in Aurora, Colo.: “Post-Covid Life Expectancy: A Deadly Trend” by Evan, “Native Life Is in Danger. The Lasting Effects of the 2020 Pandemic.” by Yannis and “Poverty, Politics and Pandemic: How Good Is Health Care Access for the Native Community?” by Haley.

You may want to think about these additional questions:

The headline for the print version of the article that included these graphs is “How Covid Reduced Native Americans’ Life Expectancy.” The headline for the online version is “Covid’s Toll on Native Americans.” How are the headlines similar and how are they different? Which do you think best summarizes the main ideas of the graphs and draws the reader’s attention?

The article, that includes these graphs, summarizes the change in life expectancy of Native Americans:

Typically, experts start to worry when they see drops in life expectancy that measure in just tenths of a year; Native Americans lost nearly seven years. The drop erases the equivalent of more than four decades of American life expectancy gains. And the average Native American person is now expected to live as long as the average American did in 1944.

Why is the rate of Covid deaths highest among Native Americans? This article and another New York Times article “How the Pandemic Shortened Life Expectancy in Indigenous Communities” offers reasons for this discrepancy in deaths between Native Americans and other racial and ethnic groups. Research one of these factors for Native Americans and for the entire country. What surprises you? What efforts are being made to improve the situation for Native Americans?

To compare the United States life expectancy at birth to other countries for the time period of 1960 - 2020, go to the World Bank data site. The site shows time series graphs, bar graphs and maps. Compare the life expectancies and their rates of change. What factors do you think affect countries’ mortality statistics? What do you think might be done to improve life expectancy?

“When a person moves into a Block home they have been on the receiving end of things,” Mr. Hohlbein said. That’s often not a comfortable place to be. “We really wanted this home and the people living there to be able to share their knowledge of sustainability and of what homelessness is about,” he said.

Facing Homelessness declined to make any of the residents available for an interview, citing respect for their privacy, but one of them said in a statement, “When you’re tired with no safe place to rest, that’s the only thing you can think about.” Now, after two years in a Block home, the resident no longer lives minute by minute.

Klein had spent a lifetime analyzing the dominant power as oligarchic: relentless, resolute, delivered from on high. She was used to connecting dots, to mapping out cause and effect in the capitalist system — from Hurricane Katrina to proliferating charter schools; from Sept. 11 to the “homeland security industry.” But it was becoming increasingly hard for her to map out what she was seeing, let alone plot it on the old left-right axis. Here was a grass-roots movement that was demanding not egalitarianism, but nativism; not solidarity, but discord. Klein was trapped inside a hall of mirrors, and she was trying to find a way out.

Before writing about her doppelgänger, Klein felt stuck. “For me, it’s very hard to disentangle writer’s block from depression,” she told me, remembering the “sense of pointlessness” she felt as the pandemic continued to grind on. “I think my crash was in the early months of the Biden administration and realizing that there was going to be an attempt to return to the same old same old.” Social media also seemed to be getting ever more poisonous. Her friend V, the playwright formerly known as Eve Ensler, recommended that Klein talk to the fiction writer Harriet Clark, who also teaches creative writing. Klein told her what she was going through: “I used to fill notebooks, you know, everywhere I went. Now I just feel unsurprised.”

Clark assigned readings, like Joan Didion’s “On Keeping a Notebook,” to encourage Klein to consider new ways of writing and noticing. At the time, Klein was arranging a move from New Jersey, where she had been teaching at Rutgers University, to British Columbia, where she had been staying since the early days of the pandemic and where her parents and brother live. Covid was still raging, and all the planning had to be done remotely. As an exercise, she wrote a personal essay about choosing what to keep and what to leave behind. Klein, who is 53, laughed as she recalled the artifacts of her former life. “Who was that person who had that many pairs of high heels and tights? Like, tights?” she joked. The germ of the book was there, she realized now, even though she hadn’t recognized it at the time. “It was about how many selves we have in our lives, and just how mutable it is.”

Compared with the single-mindedness of her previous work, in “Doppelganger,” Klein has allowed some of these selves to come through. Much of the book is funny and playful, laced with references to fiction and films, including an extended (and attentive) reading of the novel “Operation Shylock,” in which Philip Roth meets a double who calls himself Philip Roth. Some unintentional comedy comes from Wolf’s baffling tweets about “vaccines w nanopatticles that let you travel back in time” and the need to protect “general sewage supplies/waterways” from “vaccinated people’s urine/feces.”

And then there’s the rank absurdity of the Klein/Wolf mix-up. Yes, the two women are Jewish; both have brownish-blondish hair; both have written big-idea books; both have been outspoken about abuses of political power during times of crisis. But their bodies of work are distinctive, and the association between them became ever more troubling to Klein as Wolf began tweeting “pulpy theories” about 5G, about weird clouds. The confusion was widespread enough to be commemorated in a viral poem:

if the Naomi be Klein

you’re doing just fine

If the Naomi be Wolf

Oh, buddy. Ooooof.

As much as Klein recoiled at what Wolf was saying, she also felt the sting of recognition. Klein recalls the uncanny spectacle of seeing a version of her systems-level thesis in “The Shock Doctrine” — that elites will take advantage of a crisis to impose their will — twisted by the likes of Wolf, who has described Covid as “a much-hyped medical crisis” that “has taken on the role of being used as a pretext to strip us all of core freedoms.” Klein became both obsessed and repulsed, fascinated and appalled: “I felt like she had taken my ideas, fed them into a bonkers blender and then shared the thought-purée with Tucker Carlson, who nodded vehemently.” She always knew when Other Naomi had said something truly mind-boggling because her — Klein’s — Twitter mentions would fill up. (In an email, Wolf declined to comment on “Doppelganger,” explaining that she hadn’t yet read the book, but said that some of her tweets “were poorly worded and were deleted.”)"

The projects go on waiting lists that can now stretch for years, and many ultimately drop off when the delays become intolerable.

ezra klein

I’m Ezra Klein. This is “The Ezra Klein Show.” [MUSIC PLAYING] Go back eight months, six months, and the inflation news was really grim. Prices were going up and up and up. The Fed was raising interest rates at a really rapid clip. A lot of economists were warning about the possibility of stagflation, suggesting we need to have a deeply painful recession to get out of this. But in recent months, there’s been a bit of a phase change. In January, annual inflation slowed for the seventh-straight month. Unemployment is at 3.4 percent. That’s the lowest level since 1969. We are not in a recession. That doesn’t mean we’re out of the woods. Inflation is still uncomfortably high, and there’s debate over what it will take to get it to an acceptable level. But a lot of the doomsday scenarios that were being thrown around six months ago or a year ago — they look increasingly unlikely. A so-called soft landing feels more attainable today than before. So I want to have my colleague and Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman on to trace how the story has changed, and what we’ve learned, and what he’s seeing in the data. There’s another reason I want to bring him on, which is that inflation has blocked out, basically, every other economic policy debate you can imagine for the past year. But there’s a lot else going on, with Republicans and a possible debt ceiling crisis, with the Biden administration’s return to industrial policy, with the decoupling with China, the crackup of globalization — there’s a lot. And so I wanted to hear Paul on all of it. As always, my email: ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. Paul Krugman, always a pleasure.

paul krugman

Always good to be on with you.

ezra klein

So we’re talking here. It’s Feb. 14, which people all over the country celebrate for the release of the January Consumer Price Index data. They give each other cards and chocolates. It’s a beautiful day. What did that data say? How did you interpret it?

paul krugman

It was telling us not much that we didn’t already know — pretty much, consistent with the story. Lots of problems with data these days. Difficult cases make bad law. Crazy economies make bad statistics. So it’s really hard to judge exactly what’s going on. But the basic thing seems to be that inflation is down a lot, but not down to the Fed’s target, and nothing in the Valentine’s Day data release changed that picture.

ezra klein

Tell me a bit about how the inflation story has changed. Give me, sort of, the change over the three months, maybe before today’s data came out, and then there’s a little bit again of a narrative correction, with inflation hawks saying, see? This proves that we’re not out of the woods yet. So tell me where things had moved recently, and then if you think this changes it at all.

paul krugman

OK so the big news is not actually this release, but a few days ago, the Bureau of Labor Statistics updated its seasonal adjustments.

ezra klein

Ooh, this is exciting. [CHUCKLES]

paul krugman

Yeah. Yeah, it sounds like boring as hell, but it turns out, unfortunately, to be crucial. Because normally, in calmer times, you can look at change over the previous year, in which case it’s not a problem. You’re comparing month to month. But we’ve been in a situation where we think that the underlying state of the economy is changing really rapidly, so you need to be looking at shorter periods. Everybody understands that one month is not enough to draw conclusions, but a lot of people, me included, have sort of looked at three-month or six-month rates of change. But those things depend a lot on — some prices go up and down, depending on the weather, depending on the season, is it Christmas or not. And the data that you see normally are not raw price numbers. They’re numbers adjusted for the usual annual pattern of prices. But that pattern changes over time as well, and has changed, probably, quite a lot in the Covid era. So the Bureau of Labor Statistics updates it. And data update meant that what had been a really dramatic story of falling inflation over the course of the second half of 2022 has now become only a pretty persuasive story. It’s still there. But numbers that look like, hey, we’re home free, inflation is over, now look like, well, about 2/3 of the inflation surge seems to have gone away, but we’re still pretty far above where we want to be.

ezra klein

There are a lot of different numbers being thrown around right now. You hear about the Consumer Price Index. There’s what gets called core inflation. There’s supercore, and super-duper-core, There’s wages. What are the numbers, what are the indicators, that you find most useful right now for tracking the inflation picture? And the reverse of that — what are the ones you don’t find that useful, that you think can be misleading at the moment?

paul krugman

Usually, at this point, looking at supercore, which is inflation, taking out food, energy, shelter, and used cars — but it turns out that used-car prices have been crazy enough to actually skew the data — and I look at wages. But trying to look at — even that’s got problems. Those are the numbers that I think are the least likely to be giving you really false signals. We have a really big problem. A third of the Consumer Price Index is shelter. And core inflation, which people have long used — I’ve long used, too — assess some kind of underlying inflation, which takes out food and energy. That’s 40 percent shelter. But shelter prices are, basically, rents. Many people actually do rent the place they live in. And even those who don’t — the B.L.S. imputes a rental number, based upon what people who do rent are paying. People typically rent for a year. And so a measure of average rents is telling you a lot about where the economy was a year ago, not where it is now, and that’s created a crazy situation. On the one hand, we know, from a bunch of data, including some studies that the government is doing, but also studies that — information from private sources — we know that rents are flat or falling on new rentals. And meanwhile, you have the official inflation numbers that came out today, saying that the cost of shelter is rising at almost 10 percent a year. And that’s not wrong. That’s actually — if we look at what people are actually paying for apartments, that’s probably — on average, that’s probably about right, because they’re still getting their leases renewed at much higher rates. But if we’re asking whether the economy is running too hot, that it’s inflationary, that’s crazy. That’s not, in fact, happening. Our great old standby — core inflation has turned out to be a really, really misleading number at this point.

ezra klein

One measure here that economists, as far as they can all seem to agree on the importance of, is wages.

paul krugman

Yeah.

ezra klein

So why are wages so important as an indicator of inflation and where it’s going? And what does the wage data say to you over the past couple of months?

paul krugman

So wages are important, really, for two reasons. One is that, look, they are an important part of costs, and other things equal — favorite economist phrase — an increase in wages will tend to get passed on into prices — not always, and there are reasons to think that might not fully happen right now, but it is important. But also, labor is a very widely traded commodity. I know it’s people, but it’s also got a market price. And so the level of wages is a pretty good indicator of overall movements in the level of prices, generally. And it’s not wildly volatile like the price of oil or eggs, so wages is kind of a pretty good indicator, except that if the mix of workers changes, as it did during the pandemic, when a lot of low-wage service workers were laid off, and then rehired, wages become a problem as well. But various wage data — wages are rising faster than they were, prepandemic, but a lot slower than they were last winter. And depending upon your various magic-eight-ball calculations, wages are rising between one and two percentage points faster than would be consistent with the Fed’s inflation target — which kind of matches some of the other data, so that’s probably your best guess. But it’s a guess about where we are.

ezra klein

There’s something — and I recognize this is not very economist of me — but there’s something very weird about watching so many Democratic economists — people who spend most of their time that I’ve known them thinking about how to get wages higher, worrying every couple of months that the wage data is going to come in too high and we’re going to have overly high wages. I’m just curious, as somebody who worries a lot about labor markets, how the strange inversion of inflationary periods feels — like this moment, where high wages become threatening, as opposed to something to root for.

paul krugman

Yeah, well, one of my, I think, verbal tics is to say economics is not a morality play — that things that you regard as good, in general, aren’t necessarily good for the economic situation, and vice versa. And I think it’s great if we can have a period during which wages are rising faster than prices. That doesn’t stop me from saying, well, if I look at the rate of wage increase out there, it does kind of point to an economy that is probably still running too hot. I think it’s perfectly reasonable to argue that we don’t have to get wage growth back down to the levels it was during the period of rapidly rising inequality. We can have faster wage growth than that, but not, probably, as fast as what we’re seeing right now.

ezra klein

So one thing that I saw in today’s data — and predicting the reaction to today’s data — was that even after that seasonal adjustment had happened, the new numbers seem to make people feel even less confident that we were out of the woods. So Jason Furman, the former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, who’s been very, very on the inflation beat — he said, “The inflation picture that had started to look better a month ago — it turns out that a lot of that was probably a false dawn. The whole perspective we have on inflation is much worse.” So that’s a more radical downward revision in sentiment for Jason than I’m hearing for you. How do you think about that?

paul krugman

Yeah. I mean, maybe because I never fully bought into the “it’s all over” position — because like Jason, I mean, I look at pretty much the same numbers. And often, we’ve disagreed about some stuff, but basically, that seasonal adjustment change was a bit of a shocker. And there had been numbers out there before that could be read to say, it’s all over, but never the wage numbers. The wage numbers never, ever gave you that answer. And so now, that prop behind a complete victory celebration position has been knocked away from us. But I actually did not see anything in today’s numbers that really changed that. I think it was the seasonal adjustment thing that said, let’s hold off a bit on the party.

ezra klein

One thing that has seemed true over the past couple of months is we’re seeing more disinflation with less economic cost than a lot of people had begun predicting — and fearing, right? There’s a lot of talk of recession, a lot of talk of the amount of unemployment the Fed would need to create to get inflation down. Larry Summers has been saying that we would need five years of unemployment above 5 percent to contain inflation. But it has been coming down quite a bit, even if not maybe as much as people hoped. Unemployment is at 3.4 percent, which is quite low. We added a lot of jobs in January. The employment-inflation trade-off has seemed to bite, at least so far, a little bit less than a lot of people feared. Why do you think that is, and do you think that continues?

paul krugman

Yeah. I would say, it’s not a little bit less. It’s a lot less. I mean, the fact that we’ve seen whatever your preferred measure of inflation is — that it’s come down a lot over the past year, with no rise in unemployment whatsoever — that’s a pretty big deal. And there are actually two possible explanations, which are not mutually contradictory. One of them is that a lot of the Team Transitory Arguments that said all of this is pandemic-related disruptions, and that as supply chains get kinked and things normalize, that we’ll be seeing inflation come down spontaneously — a lot of that was true. A lot of the inflation we were seeing was, in fact, one-time events, which were just much broader in scope than anyone had imagined. I certainly didn’t see a surge in rents, probably as a consequence of the explosion of work-from-home, which, in turn, was driven by the pandemic. I didn’t see that coming, and yet, that had a huge impact on the inflation numbers. The other is that we haven’t had an economy that’s been running this hot on a sustained basis for a long time. And most of what we thought we knew about unemployment-inflation trade-offs comes from periods when the economy probably had a fair bit of slack in it, when it was operating below its capacity. And so a fair number of people even predicted in advance that the trade-offs would get much steeper, so that when the economy overheated, inflation went up much faster than people expected, but then as the economy, probably — at least spending cooled off a bit, inflation came down much faster as well. So it’s kind of — the combination of the craziness of the period, plus, we’ve been experimenting with running the economy close to and maybe beyond full employment, which we haven’t done for a very long time.

ezra klein

I remember talking to Biden administration economists early in the administration. And they were saying to me then that the great experiment of this administration, compared to recent eras, was they were going to try to run the economy hot. They were going to try to push a lot of demand into it. They were going to try to get unemployment much lower. They were going to try to get wages much higher. And they did. I mean, they really got it to run hot. And then, there was a period where the sense was, this will be seen as the big mistake of the Biden administration. They ran it too hot. They put too much stimulus in there. The Fed was too slow to act, which isn’t necessarily their fault, but nevertheless. And now, we have this terrible inflation problem. It’s eating back the wage gains. It’s going to force the Fed to throw the economy into recession. Do you think maybe that sort of corrective judgment is now looking a bit wrong, too, and they deserve some real credit for taking the risk to run this hot? I mean, if we’re able to get this down — and I don’t want to unroll a mission-accomplished banner here, but it’s not an insignificant thing that unemployment is 3.4 percent — not an insignificant thing that there’s a tight labor market. It does help people who have been left out for a very long time. I guess, to wrap this into a question, how do you see the Biden administration’s macroeconomic policy record at this juncture?

paul krugman

Well, at this point, it’s looking pretty good. It was not a happy thing that inflation shot up to levels that people hadn’t seen since the 1980s. That rattled people quite a lot, but there’s pretty much overwhelming evidence that did not get entrenched — to use one of those phrases — that people did not start building the expectation of inflation forever into their decisions. So it was, in fact, a passing phase and — find whatever other synonyms you can look for, for transitory — it does, in fact, look transitory, although the transit took longer and was bigger than people expected. And meanwhile, we have had a full recovery of the labor market far, far faster than the last one. Instead of eight years of elevated unemployment, we’ve had two years of elevated unemployment — not even. And it actually looks pretty good. A lot of the forecasts that reasonable people are making suggest that inflation may well be a number with a two-handle — that is, something under 3 — by the end of this year. And unemployment will be something with a three-handle, probably under 4 percent. That’s a win. We were hit with a massive, massive economic shock, and we got back to full employment. Then we had a brief period — in the rearview mirror — a brief period of high inflation. That’s pretty darn good.

ezra klein

So the Fed is still having to manage this very actively. What they are going to do is still somewhat uncertain. You had a wonderful analogy for them, or metaphor for them, where you said you often think of the Federal Reserve as operating heavy machinery in a very dark room while wearing mittens.

paul krugman

Yeah.

ezra klein

I took the point of that as, they don’t have the delicacy — they sort of have to turn the dials pretty hard, oftentimes, in one direction or another, and they don’t have all the information they would like to have. So I want to ask you about the Fed this way. If you’re an adviser in Jerome Powell’s ear, making the case for him to err on the side of doing too much, and you’re an adviser making the case for him to err on the side of doing a bit less, how do you make those cases? What is your hawk case, what is your dove case to him?

Well, the hawk case is that this economy still looks really hot. And probably, that 500,000 job gain that we just saw was not exactly real. I mean, not that there was anything fake, but that it was probably not representative of how hot the economy is running. But the economy is still looking like an economy that is running sort of beyond full employment.

ezra klein

What does that mean, quickly, for people who aren’t used to hot and full employment? What does it mean for an economy to be hot?

paul krugman

Good question. The jargon does tend to take over your brain, no matter what you do. We know that the overall level of spending in the economy determines, basically, what’s going to happen. And if you have an increase in overall spending — consumer spending, government spending, all kinds of spending — that that’s going to lead both to more jobs, more production, but also to higher prices. And the trade-off — what fraction of it leads to higher prices, as opposed to more jobs, is one of those big questions that keep on revising our answers to. But there’s clearly some kind of trade-off there. And running the economy too hot just, basically, means that spending is so high, that we’ve gone beyond the point where we’re willing to accept the faster increase in prices, in return for having a lot of jobs out there. What makes it unacceptable is not so much even the fact that nobody likes inflation, as the fact that you do fear — that if inflation stays high for a long time, that it will get entrenched in the economy. And so you don’t want that to happen. And so if I were trying to convince Powell to keep hiking those rates, I’d say, look, we know that inflation expectations have stayed anchored all through. But how much do you want to count on that happening? And look, the economy is still going gangbusters. So since you’re trying to slow it down, you haven’t done enough. The reverse case is, well, yeah, but you know, inflation expectations are staying anchored, and we’re not sure that the economy will stay this strong. We may still be seeing some delayed effects of federal aid from two years ago. It’s not clear that there are some oddities about construction, where housing starts are down, but employment isn’t. And there is a real risk that at some point, all of a sudden, the effects of those rate hikes really kick in, and the economy starts to go into a serious downturn, a nosedive — although that’s probably exaggerating it. And yet, if you ask, which of those guys am I, the answer is, I’m probably both and neither. It’s a very, very hard call to make, because the situation is very confusing.

ezra klein

You’ve critiqued the inflation indicators the Fed and Powell prefer to look at. Tell me which ones they seem to like, and why you’re not convinced those are the ones to follow.

paul krugman

Well, they’ve chosen — I mean, there is this — so we now have this range. We used to just have inflation and core inflation and —

ezra klein

In my day — [CHUCKLES] inflation indicators were simple.

paul krugman

That’s right. Now, the Fed has settled on core services, ex-housing, which they are claiming is a measure of underlying labor cost pressure.

ezra klein

And is that indices focused on service sector?

paul krugman

Yes, it’s all services. Obviously, there’s goods. There’s stuff that you can put your hand on, and there’s services, which is somebody doing something for you. And our economy is mostly services rather than goods. We had — normally, they tend to move in tandem. Normally, goods tend to get cheaper over time, relative to services, but at a consistent pace. But the pandemic did crazy stuff. All of a sudden, people couldn’t eat out, so they bought kitchen equipment. They couldn’t go to the gym, so they bought Pelotons. And so we had this crunch on the supply of goods. Goods prices went soaring. Now, goods prices are coming back down to Earth, and so if you’re looking at goods prices, it looks like we’re into rapid disinflation, maybe even actually falling prices. But services are still rising. But then, part of that is, one of the services is the services provided by housing, which we now know is lagging far behind what’s really going on in the rental market. And so you end up with this services excluding shelter and then trying to exclude some of the stuff that involves energy as well. And it’s a pretty narrow category. And the more you restrict the set, the more what’s left is starting to be stuff that is possibly measured with error. One of the — unimportant, but one of the costs of this whole episode, for people like me, has been I’m learning much more than I ever wanted to about how price indices are constructed. And there’s a lot more necessary, basically, educated guesswork than you’d like. And the narrower you make your index, the more guesswork there is. So that’s one problem with it. The other is, it is kind of funny that the Fed is looking at, pretty much, the only indicator that isn’t showing a lot of disinflation. And you have to wonder, shouldn’t we at least be looking at an array of things. And if 9 out of 10 showed that inflation is coming down, should we be relying too much on the 10th, which doesn’t agree with all of the others? Kind of a minority report approach to inflation. And there’s one more thing, which is that the White House the Council of Economic Advisers said, if this is supposed to be an indicator of wage pressure, let’s go and directly measure what’s happening to wages in this sector that the Fed is focusing on — which they’ve done. And it is showing disinflation. It’s still showing wages rising faster than they were before the pandemic. But it’s not showing the kind of — it is showing progress. So they’re saying the Fed has chosen an indirect measure, but we can measure it directly, and the direct measure looks a kind of OK.

ezra klein

I understand that one of the reasons they like that measure is a fear that the nature of inflation is shifting — that a year ago, it was goods and used cars and things like that, and as those prices have come down, and supply chains have unkinked, now, it’s moving over to the service sector. And the secondary fear is that that’s a lot harder to bring down without inflicting a lot of economic pain, because of how much of the service sector’s cost is really wages and labor and people.

paul krugman

Yeah.

ezra klein

Do you think that’s true? I mean, do they have, first, a point, because that’s where it is now, and second, if that is where it is now — does that make the job harder?

paul krugman

Well, I think that is — inflation is now a service sector issue, not a goods sector issue. And there’s good reason to believe that wages are stickier. The cost of a worker is much less volatile than the cost of a shipping container. But as for saying that — if that’s your concern, why not just look at wages? So I am a little bit puzzled that the Fed has chosen to go this route. I understand their concern. But it does seem like they’re trying a really kind of a Rube Goldberg device approach to something that you could just try to measure directly. So I’m a little bit puzzled. I’m not quite sure. I have an enormous regard for the Fed, and the staff at the Fed in particular are terrific. But you do have this feeling that — look, people like me, who are excessively optimistic, but even at other times, when we were actually right, have always been accused of searching through inflation measures and finding the ones that throw out the inflation. Now, there’s this slight feel that the Fed is searching through inflation measures and finding the one that throws out the disinflation. It does seem a little odd that they’ve managed to hit the one measure, out of this large array of possible measures, that is not showing any reason for optimism.

ezra klein

So we’ve talked a bit here about the idea of inflation being above the Fed’s target. The target is 2 percent. There’s a view — I think you hold this view, too — that getting inflation down from 9 to 6 — that’s easier than getting it down from 6 to 3. But when we look — pretty likely to be able to get down to 4, 3 — getting it down that last mile to 2 might be a really big deal — or might cause a lot of suffering, is more what I’m saying there, not to be euphemistic. Why 2 percent? Why should 2 percent, rather than 3 percent, even be the goal?

paul krugman

Yeah. You know, I’ve spent a lot of time on this issue from way back. And it’s one of the few things out there where you really can say that it’s New Zealand’s fault. Because New Zealand was the first central bank to explicitly introduce an inflation target, and they set it at 0 percent to 2 percent, so 2 percent was the New Zealand contribution to the debate. But more to the point — 2 percent, long ago — 2 percent seemed like a perfect compromise between opposing factions. There were people who wanted true price stability, because they thought prices should be stable. Money should have — you have stable purchasing power. And there were people who were worried that in the face of a severe recession, interest rates might drop to zero, and that wouldn’t be low enough, and that we would need — it would be less likely that we would hit that zero lower bound if inflation was positive. And circa 1999, which is more or less when all of this jelled, it appeared both that you could make the case the inflation was really zero, if you included technological progress and quality change — what value did you place on being able to watch TikToks? And 2 percent kind of satisfied the stable-price people. And on the other side, it looked, given the modeling at the time, as if 2 percent was high enough, that being unable to reduce interest rates below zero would ever be a serious problem. But of course, that’s a long time ago, and that second proposition turned out to be totally wrong. We spent most of the time between the 2008 financial crisis and the pandemic with interest rates at zero. So in a way, what we’ve had is this orthodoxy congealed around 2 percent that was based upon reasonable analysis 25 years ago, but not based on what we now know to be — what we now believe to be the truth. So I’ve raised this. I’ve been in meetings, including closed-door meetings full of people in suits, and you say — you make the intellectual case for three — actually, making more sense, given the data, than — given what we’ve experienced, than two — and people get absolutely bonkers at the notion. I think part of it is the fear, somehow, that if you loosen up a bit, if you change the target, then suddenly, the 1970s will come back — that then, people will start to believe, well, if it can go from 2 to 3, then why not 3 to 5, and 5 to 10? And I don’t think it’s reasonable, but that’s a fear that really weighs on people’s minds.

ezra klein

How much of that, do you think, is economics, and how much of that goes to what you describe as your verbal tic, which is a tendency of many to treat economics in general, but I think, particularly inflation, as a morality play?

paul krugman

I think that’s a really important thing. I think it’s a funny thing. If you talk to central bankers — I don’t actually talk to Jerome Powell, but if you talk to people who are in this position, many of them, in their sort of Walter Mitty fantasies — they see themselves as the next Paul Volcker, the strong, tough man who cured inflation. And very few, I think, see themselves as the next Ben Bernanke, the guy whose willingness to break with orthodoxy and pour money into the system saved the world from a second Great Depression. And it’s a funny thing. Why — actually, if you want to ask me, who was the greatest central banker in history, I would actually probably say, Mario Draghi, who saved the euro. And he saved the euro by being willing to do more, by being willing to be less tough. But if you asked central bankers, I’m sure that most of them would answer Paul Volcker. So there is this sense that you’re put in this position to be willing to impose pain, not by being willing to go easy on people.

ezra klein

And so to go back to that question of, what’s wrong with 3, in a recent interview, Jason Furman, who I trust and have respect for and has been on the show a number of times — he said, quote, “the most likely outcome is what I’d call continued overheating. The unemployment rate never rises above 4.5 percent. The inflation rate, on a sustained basis, never falls below 3 percent. And so we’re still grappling with this problem at the end of the year.” If those were the numbers at the end of 2023, would you agree that we are grappling with a problem, or that we’ve reached a good steady state?

paul krugman

I actually very much doubt that we’re going to have unemployment of 4.5. But take the generic — take the qualitative thing, where unemployment is low, the economy is still running pretty hot, but inflation is running at 3 percent. I would think that there would be a pretty good case for calling that a win. Jason’s a lot younger than I am. I remember the late 1980s. I remember Ronald Reagan after he declared morning in America. We had 4 percent inflation at that point, and nobody walked around saying, oh my god, it’s terrible, we have inflation. People sort of thought that was kind of OK. So I don’t actually think it’s a really bad thing, unless we see really good reason to believe that we’re going to start to develop that stagflation cycle that, so far, has been completely absent. I don’t think it’s a terrible thing. [MUSIC PLAYING]

ezra klein

So I want to take a step back now from inflation, which I think has had this quality of blotting out the entire sun of other economic policy questions for about a year.

paul krugman

Sure.

ezra klein

We seem to be barreling towards the debt ceiling crisis again — for those of us around in 2011. It’s funny, because I used to talk to this guy, Jay Powell, at the Bipartisan Policy Center, about the debt ceiling all the time back in 2010 and 2011. He was just an economic policy wonk. He knew all about how to prioritize payments. And now, he’s Federal Reserve Chair. It’s weird how things work. But so there can be this feeling of rerunning it. It’s like the same players, in some ways, and Republicans just took the House. But you’ve argued that this is actually quite different, because the Republican Party itself has changed so much over the last decade, and so what they’re trying to do, if anything at all, has changed quite dramatically. So tell me how you contrast the debt ceiling fight of 2011 from the debt ceiling fight we seem to be headed towards now.

paul krugman

Yeah, there are actually several ways in which this is quite different — which doesn’t mean that I know how it’s going to turn out. But the first thing is, yeah, the Republican Party — in 2011, it was, more or less, in terms of economic policy — it was Paul Ryan’s party. And so what the Republican Party wanted was, or the demands they were trying to place, were basically, cut Medicare and Social Security, which now, they’re screaming that that’s not what they want. So it’s going to be a little bit hard for them to try and make that a negotiating demand, although in effect, it is what they want, but it’s not top of their list. They’re much more into culture war than any of this stuff now. And they’re also fragmented. If I negotiate with the Republican Party, it’s a bit like the old question, if I want to talk to Europe, who do I call. I mean, yes, there is a Speaker of the House, but nobody actually thinks that he has the ability to tell his members what to do. So it’s not even clear who you’re negotiating with, if you try. So the Republicans are very different. They’re really, now, very much more a culture war party than they are a small-government economic-ideology party. The Democrats are different. Democrats are a lot tougher about this. There are very many fewer Democrats with illusions that if we can just get through this one thing, we can go back to bipartisan governing. There must be somebody in the Senate who still believes that, but I don’t think there’s any senior people in the Biden administration who believed that. And there’s a broader environment. There’s kind of — I used to talk about the very serious people, all in caps. There was — in 2011, everybody in Washington was all obsessed with deficits, as you yourself wrote. There seemed to be a rule that, on all other issues, reporters had to at least pretend to be neutral, but to be anti-deficit, that was considered to be something you could say in what was supposedly objective reporting. Now, it’s not nearly that much out there. That whole complex of deficit hawks or deficit scolds still kind of exists, but it’s a shadow of its former self. So we’re in a situation now where there is no consensus that Social Security and Medicare should be cut. Democrats have no desire to — or believe in making a compromise with Republicans, and Republicans really don’t know what they want. So although the mechanics look the same, the surrounding context is completely different.

ezra klein

Do you have an answer to the question, what is the Republican Party’s economic agenda, at this point?

paul krugman

No, because I don’t think they have one. I mean, as I think of it, the leading voices, the people with real political clout now, for the most part, certainly in the House, are culture warriors, ideologues, a lot of white nationalism. But anyway, whatever it is that they care about, they don’t really much care about economics at all. A lot of the, kind of, staff — a lot of the people — if they say, write me a bill, the people who are assigned to do that — a lot of them, basically, grew up inside the hothouse environment of right-wing think tanks, where they’ve absorbed all of this magic of tax cuts, evil government spending ideology. But that’s almost more of an instinctive reflex than it is a party ideology at this point. So God knows, I mean, if you were to ask, what does Marjorie Taylor Greene believe constitutes good economic policy, does she even know that? I just find it very hard to figure out what the point is.

ezra klein

I thought it was very striking that the big moment of controversy out of the State of the Union was that Biden said Republicans want to cut, sunset, eliminate Social Security, et cetera, and Republicans booed at that and felt very offended. Kevin McCarthy, in the utter opposite of the kind of thing Paul Ryan did, has said that cuts to Social Security and Medicare are off the table. Mitch McConnell was clearly very unhappy with Senator Rick Scott’s big budget proposal that was full of entitlement cuts and full of things that are scary to median voters, that at the same time, they don’t have much of an economic policy, they’ve quite run away from a lot of what seemed to be the core of what they all said they wanted in 2011.

paul krugman

Yeah, this is representing — well, a lot of time has gone by. It’s a very, very different cast of characters — except for Mitch McConnell is still there. But it’s just, people who make a point of becoming Republican candidates, people who are running, are not doing it because they want to implement laissez-faire economic policies. They have a variety of motivations, and I’m sure you’re talking to other people about all of that. But this just isn’t top of the agenda, and they don’t really have a philosophy anymore.

ezra klein

You wrote an interesting piece about this. I think it was called something like, we’re going to miss the era of greed and insincerity. I might have it wrong from memory. But you make a very interesting point in it that I think is true, which is that for quite a long time, the theory that many people have of the Republican Party was that the culture-war side of it was a little bit fake. They might believe, but they don’t really care about it, and they were just using it to cut taxes for rich people and deregulate and so on. And that now, if anything, it often seems to be the reverse. If you think about the Trumpist Republican Party, a lot of the figures who seem to be rising in the Republican Party — they’ll say almost anything on economics. What they really care about is whether or not critical race theory is taught in schools, and which books are in the library, and whether or not drag queens get to do story hour. And the culture war increasingly seems to be the beating heart, and there’s more opportunism on economics in the hopes that you can get into power to vanquish wokeness.

paul krugman

Yeah. I mean, I think that the theory of the Republican Party as, basically, the plutocrats using culture war, and then putting them back in the closet after the election — that was a pretty valid picture of the party 20 years ago. I mean, that was the 2004 election, and Bush wins the election, as I like to say, by running as the defender of America against gay married terrorists, and then says, and now, I’m going to privatize Social Security. But what happened is that the people who thought they were using the culture warriors found out that in the end, at this point, they’re the ones being used. They’re not in charge anymore. And now, one thing that is a little surprising, we’ll say, is that we haven’t seen more of the culture warriors being willing to go the whole way and start advocating genuine economic populism. I mean, one of the things that one might have expected or, depending on your politics, I guess, feared, would be that they would do something like — a little bit like the former National Front in France — forgetting what they call themselves now, but Marine Le Pen — that they would be, actually, advocating a strong welfare state, but only for the right kind of people. [INAUDIBLE] welfare state, people sometimes say, why don’t they just give up on this whole, let’s cut Social Security and Medicare thing and ditch these extremely unpopular right-wing economic policies? There are reasons for that. Among other things, they still want the money from the billionaires. But it is remarkable how little the things that we used to think the Republican Party was all about seem to be hardly even on their scopes these days.

ezra klein

I think this gets to the reverse of something you were saying a minute ago, which is that — what economic policy does Marjorie Taylor Greene have? Not much of one. And the reason we bring her up is that she controls a lot of attention in the party. There is clearly a lot of energy from this Trumpist social media-oriented side. But if you go look at who runs committees in the Republican House, who’s running energy and commerce in ways and means, and finance, and so on — it’s not all the newest, most Trumpy figures. So some of them might — J.D. Vances and so on — some of them might have — I don’t exactly want to call it “populist,” but they might be willing or interested in doing different things on economic policy. But whatever they control in terms of attention, they don’t still control the governing levers of the party. I mean, it’s still — I think something that is really still quite underrated about the Republican Party is, whatever the allegiance it has to Donald Trump, it remains very much in its congressional wing, this party in transition. I mean, Trump comes in. It’s still Paul Ryan’s party in the House, so they end up trying to repeal Obamacare. They end up passing these very unpopular tax cuts. Sort of, Trump ends up yoked, to some degree, to the Ryan agenda. And now, it’s moved much more towards him. But first, he’s very incoherent himself. But second, it hasn’t lost that whole side of the party. It just — there isn’t unity in the party. It doesn’t — it can’t want anything, because it isn’t — even less so than normal parties, I think, at this point, it isn’t one thing. I almost blanch calling it a party at all. I don’t think it acts like a party. I don’t think it has the internal coherence to make decisions. And so there’s this weird thing where the sort of attention-getters really matter, but they can’t pass anything. The people who run the parts that pass things — they’re not connected to the core of the base anymore. It’s just a very weird structure that I think is going to create a whole lot of governing problems, because as you were saying, there’s nobody to call, who can actually control it.

paul krugman

Yeah. And one of the things is that — this is partly what happened to Trump as well — is that actually turning your ideology or preferences or prejudices or whatever into policy is not a trivial matter, because a lot of just plain detail grunt work that’s involved. I mean, if you actually — if you read Robert Caro’s great biography of Robert Moses, Moses first established his reputation as being the best drafter of legislation in Albany. He knew how to write a bill that would make something happen in ways that people didn’t understand, but he did. And if you ask who among this current crop of — among the Fox News class of Republicans — who among them has any idea how to write a bill, the answer, I would assume — basically, none of them. And the people who do, to the extent that anybody in the Republican Party knows how to do that now — they are probably people who, basically, came up the Paul Ryan route. They came up through the right-wing think tanks and all of that. But it does mean that there’s no real coherent message. There’s no coherent policy goal. It’s just a lot of free-floating hostility.

ezra klein

Let’s talk about that question of writing a bill that does what it says on the tin. So if you look back over the past couple of years of the Biden administration, they’ve passed a series of big bills that, among other things, a lot of people, I think correctly, have heralded as a return of what gets called industrial policy — the government getting interested in supporting fostering, nurturing particular domestic industries. And one of the specific things these bills try to do is, using both carrots and sticks, locate and build very advanced manufacturing chains in the U.S. We’re trying to onshore semiconductor manufacturing, onshore a lot of the electric vehicle production process, onshore a lot of the battery production process. We’re investing a lot of money in that. We have these various Buy American provisions, which could slow down some of the adoption of things we really care about. But the hope on the Biden administration side is, that will actually lead to us building these industries. How do you think about that? Do you we’re going to be able to do this?

paul krugman

Well, I think we will be able to make it happen. Whether it will actually be efficient, whether the industrial policy aspects are going to make G.D.P. grow faster, is very much up in the air. We really don’t know that. But in a way, that’s a hope, but it’s not the point. Above all, the Inflation Reduction Act is another one of those — the name has absolutely nothing to do with what it’s really about. It’s primarily a climate change bill, but it tries to fight climate change through industrial policy — not because the drafters necessarily believed that industrial policy was the best way to do it, but because they thought that was the politically feasible way to do it. Because — by using carrots rather than sticks, by saying, here’s a tax credit for buying energy-efficient stuff made in America, rather than saying, we’re going to tax your carbon emissions, that they had, basically, the only way that you could get major legislation passed. And I’m not terribly afraid. I mean, there are some people who look at industrial policy and say, oh my god, inefficiency, it’ll hurt the economy. Yeah, maybe, maybe not — unlikely to be, actually, even within the measurement error, in terms of the G.D.P. growth rate. What it does do is it makes it politically possible to do things that we really do need to do, like fight climate change.

ezra klein

Well, for the sake of argument here, let me take the other side of this, which — and not the other side from the conservative perspective, but from the liberal perspective. If you listen to environmental scientists and climate scientists, and I do, they say, we’ve got to do this really quick. The decarbonization timeline, to take decarbonization as the example, is unbelievably short. We need to be inventing, manufacturing, deploying, distributing, and using the stuff at a speed and a scale unlike anything since the construction of the highway system. And I don’t particularly care about 1/10 of a point on G.D.P. from these measures. But I think the concern that people legitimately have is that they will slow down adoption, that we are not going to be able to do this that fast, that we — losing five years on this stuff, or slowing things down when we need them to come out really quickly, really does matter. And China is very, very good at creating solar panels and wind turbines and so on, at this point. And China’s got its problems, but climate change is also a very big problem. So take it off of the question of G.D.P.. I think there’s a concern. There’s, like, one hand of the Democratic policy body that is all about moving faster. And then, another — the other hand is layering on all these standards and ideas about politics, which maybe are good, but are going to slow things down. And when we keep being told speed is of the essence, and then keep being told, well, it’s worth it to make this trade-off for speed, there’s at least some tension there.

paul krugman

Yeah, although I don’t think speed is really going to be the issue. I don’t believe that we’re going to lose a lot of time by having, particularly, Buy American provisions, will delay things — maybe. I’m not even sure it’ll significantly delay, say, the electrification of transportation. And the shift to renewables — I’m not sure it’ll delay it at all. It’ll make it more expensive — probably get less bang for the buck, in terms of decarbonization. It’s a miracle that we got this at all. Just a few months before the midterm elections, it looked like the whole agenda had collapsed. There was going to be nothing — no major action on climate change. And then, miraculously, we get something that, at least the environmental modelers I talk to — they’re kind of over the moon. They think that effectively, Biden got 80 percent of what he was aiming for, in terms of climate change policy. And if he did so at the cost of some inefficiency, well, OK, that’s unfortunate, but it looks to me as if political reality is reality. And given the political reality, we actually did remarkably well on all of this.

ezra klein

Well, I agree, given the political reality. And I don’t want to take the other side of this, because I think the I.R.A. is an unbelievable achievement, and I was so deeply relieved when it passed. But there’s a question of political reality and this question of climate reality, I think. And the thing that has been on my mind a lot, talking to — I think, presumably, the same modelers you talk to, like people like Jesse Jenkins and others who have been very involved in the climate fight — is — they’re all terrified, as best I can tell, about deployment. And I’ve been trying to dig in more, in my own reporting, on what it takes to get a next-generation energy project built — or for that matter, in California, just what it takes to get a house built. And it’s tough. You really do see things get slowed down for, I mean, a year or years. I’ve reported a bit on congestion pricing in New York, and I mean, that’s been held up, and now, it’s moving forward, I think. But it really spent a lot of time in environmental review for what’s very much a pro-environment policy. And so I mean, one of my big themes has been this idea of the supply side and how that interacts with liberal values. Because I think that oftentimes Democrats and liberals underestimate how much constraints on supply actually end up foiling or slowing down or reversing things that are intended to achieve both progressive, but more to the point, good and just ends.

paul krugman

Yeah. But that’s really not an industrial policy or a Buy American policy question. It’s a question of how much we’re going to allow regulatory snarls, NIMBYism in the broad sense, to hold things up. And this is a place where we’ll see what happens, but there will probably be some cases where it’s going to be really important to yell at people who think that they’re progressives, but in the name of saving some notion of a place’s character — I’m sounding like I sneer at that, but that’s real. But there are things that are more important, and saving the planet from a catastrophe is more important than that. And we do kind of need a bit of a wartime mentality, where you have to be willing to take some risks of some things that you don’t want to see happening, in order to get this stuff rolled out. And so sure. In a way, that’s almost a case for industrial policy. It’s saying that if we just provide price incentives, well, then you’re going to get people coming up with all kinds of reasons why you can’t do things. And if you say we have a federal-backed project that is going to build a green energy facility here, and we are going to bring the full political weight of the President of the United States on you to make sure that you don’t stop it from happening, that may be more likely to get things done.

One of the things I’ve been kind of tracking in this area is sort of the difficulties of building things in the real world. And I wrote this piece on slowing construction productivity that you had, I thought, an interesting response to. Do you want to talk a bit about how you understand the construction, productivity puzzle or state of play, and some of the arguments you’re making there?

paul krugman

OK. Now, construction really is strikingly inefficient in the United States. So even leaving aside the question of whether it’s really true that we’ve had no productivity increase for half a century, which I don’t think is fully plausible, even though that’s what the numbers say, we do know that from place of things that we can measure — we know that it’s immensely slower and more expensive to, say, construct a mile of mass transit in the United States. So we have a real problem we have somehow created in the land that’s supposed to be the land of the free market. We’ve created a situation where building stuff has many, many obstacles, and it’s amazingly easy for really quite narrow self-interest groups to block it. And addressing that is really, really important. There’s a danger — I was just struck, because I happen to remember the productivity debates in the ‘70s, when productivity growth slowed down abruptly, more or less, as we began having significant safety and environmental regulation. And there, it was important to note that, actually, we got a lot, in terms of reduced workplace injuries and improved environment out of those regulations, even if they weren’t perfect. But just clearly, a lot of — you don’t have to be a complete “regulation is bad” guy to think that we have problems of regulations. On the other hand, you don’t have to be a complete “regulation is always a mistake” person — to take the opposite position. Clearly, we have a construction problem in America, in a way I very much doubt that it is really the case that we’ve made no productivity gains at all in construction. It just kind of defies perceptions. And if you — to some extent, if the data are telling you something that really conflicts with what you think you see with your naked eye, you might really want to ask about the data, but clearly, we do have a problem. and that should be the issue.

ezra klein

One of the really interesting conversations I had in that piece was with this guy, Ed Zarenski, who has been in — was in construction for almost 40 years. Now, he’s a sort of consultant and analyst. Here’s an estimate. He’s worked on a lot of job sites. And he was saying, sort of to the point you’re making, that when he started in the ‘70s, the safety regulations on the job site were almost unnoticeable. And now, they’re quite profound. And that’s a place where, I think, if it slows things down, it’s probably very much for the good. On the other hand, it’s pushed me back — and I’d be curious how you think about him, because he’s such an important figure in your field — it puts me back to thinking about this book by Mancur Olson on “The Rise and Decline of Nations,” which I don’t think is a book that’s correct in every respect, and I think that it spends way too much time assuming everybody’s selfishly trying to get their piece of the pie and get money for themselves. But a lot of our growth as a country in recent decades has been in places where you don’t have to ask them any permissions before doing something. I mean, sometimes worryingly so — finance, the internet. And when you get into areas where you are dealing with a lot of different stakeholders in any one project — construction is, I think, a really good example of that. I mean, to build something, you’ve got neighbors, you’ve got emergency access vehicles, you’ve got safety regulators, you’ve got people who don’t like the noise, you’ve got a million players. And sort of, I think, the Mancur Olson take on a lot of things, for us, but also in maybe other advanced nations, is that as countries get really stable and really rich, they develop all these different groups who, for reasons that are sometimes really good and sometimes bad, are able to have their say and just everything slows down. And I think his view is almost as irreversible without some kind of crisis, which I don’t think is my view, but I’m curious how you take his work. Because he’s in your field. It’s just somebody I’ve been enjoying reading.

paul krugman

Olson’s book — they’re actually — the biggest single insight from his book is that political action in general, it’s a public good. That there — where people can free-ride on other people. So you can have bad outcomes, because even though some policy choices are very much against the interest of the general public, no one person has much of an incentive to organize against it. And on the other hand, there may be some quite small interest group that dominates back in the days, when it used to be the kind of thing I worried about. We used to talk about — the U.S. had sugar import quotas that raised the cost of food for everybody. Sugar is two or three times as expensive in the United States, as it was on the world market. But nobody knew that. Because sugar is an all-pervasive ingredient, and you never see it. On the other hand, there were really a handful of sugar cane growers in the United States, and they were the ones who had the lobbying power. So that was a powerful insight, and the idea that it can be a restraint on growth — I think — also may have been just too cosmic. He kind of — it was kind of generic and lacking in specifics. But as it happens, the whole housing construction area is one where you can really see that happening. If we ask, where in America do workers seem to be most productive, where do we seem to — do people seem to produce the most, where workers are most needed? And they tend to be in the Bay Area. They tend to be in New York. They tend not always, but by and large, the most productive places are places where you have a big concentration of technology and knowledge, which also, for the most part are places that make it almost impossible to build housing, so that people who should be productively employed in those places end up moving someplace else, being less productive, because they can’t afford a house. And when you try to put numbers, to what that costs people have done that, and they’re quite large with the U.S. is probably I mean I’ve seen numbers as high as — poorer than it would be if we didn’t have this basically NIMBYism, if we didn’t prevent housing construction in places where there’s actually really strong demand for workers.

ezra klein

A lot of the work that you won the Nobel for is in trade economics. And we’ve had, I think, a pretty big shift in the politics around trade, and not just where Republicans are on it, but where Democrats are. There is on-and-off talk of decoupling with China. Certainly, I think, a sense that China policy over the last few decades was too liberal and too optimistic — how would you say attitudes towards trade in economics and in politics have changed? And are you comfortable with the changes?

paul krugman

I’m never comfortable with anything. [LAUGHS] But look, we have an economic theory, which says, free trade, is by and large, good. And it’s a good theory, and it’s very insightful. We tend to make too much of it. Economists tend to celebrate free trade more than their own models say they should. Because it’s an insight that economists have, that the general public does not. And so we make a big deal out of it, more so, that the inefficiencies caused by protectionism get far more attention than the inefficiencies caused by dysfunctional health care policy, and yet, health care policy is a much, much bigger source of inefficiency in the economy than protectionism is. So in some sense we’re kind of coming off the high of being all hyped on the virtues of trade. We also had a political theory, which was that commerce, bread, peace — that particular, as with the breakup of the communist world, there was a lot of hope that integrating former communist countries into the world economy would push them towards becoming democratic good citizens of the world — [GERMAN] as the Germans would say. And what’s happened now is that we have had some rude awakenings. We’ve learned that countries can become deeply integrated in the world economy and get a lot richer and still remain authoritarian and not bring in Western values along with Western technology. And especially between China’s backsliding, China is becoming more authoritarian over time. And now, it turns out that the era of aggressive wars of conquest isn’t over either. I think a lot of people are willing to say, look, there’s still a lot to be said for global commerce, but defending the openness of world markets has moved down several rungs on our list of priorities.

ezra klein

We seem to be in an era of pretty intense weaponization of economic policy. You think about — the sanctions regime that we’ve encircled Russia with. You think of, not just the train stuff that Trump is doing with China, which Joe Biden is mostly kept, but Biden’s escalation into trying to lock them out of some advanced semiconductor, trade and materials and manufacturing and a sort of clear view that we should try to slow the technological progress on certain frontiers. How has that read to you? Do you think — do you think these are good moves, and they make sense, given the geopolitical context? Do you think that they are, sort of, Washington falling into a new Cold War mentality, that isn’t for the best. How has that all set with you? - So the stuff that Biden is doing is very serious. We are explicitly trying to hobble the technological development of a rival power. That is very, very serious stuff. That is something I don’t think we’ve seen — it is the Cold War — is going back to trying to prevent technology transfer to the Soviet bloc. And I think it makes sense, unfortunately. The dangers are real. Actually, a funny story — so I spent a year in the US government in the Reagan administration, which is hard to believe, in ‘82, ‘83. But now, it’s a political staff level. The guy behind the table passing up notes to his principal. And I sat in on a debate, cabinet-level debate, about what can we do to stop the Europeans from building gas pipelines to Russia. Because that’s the U.S. view — was that would be dangerous. It would create strategic vulnerability. And basically, the answer — we couldn’t figure out a way to stop them from doing it. But you know what? People who were worried about that were right. In the end, it turns out that becoming dependent on Russian gas was a genuine security risk to Western Europe. It took a long time for that particular bomb to go off, but it turns out to be real. So we now know that these national security concerns are real. We know that the age of aggressive governments authoritarian regimes that pose a threat to the world order is not over. So yeah, it’s tough stuff, it makes me very nervous, but I don’t think we can go back to the kind of innocence that a lot of people had as late as the Obama years. I think you go back in time a year, 18 months, there is a sense of China as being this inevitably rising power. They have a zero-Covid policy. Their economy is weathering lockdown pretty well. They have all this manufacturing prowess that, increasingly, everybody else is jealous of. It feels like they are rising, and we’re fading. And a lot of that seems to have reversed, in a pretty compressed period of time, and you’ve written a few things about the aura of China’s inevitability shattering. Tell me about how your assessments of China’s arc have changed.

paul krugman

OK, I mean, the fundamental fact about China is that they are, obviously — they’re human beings, with all of the usual human capacities, and have, in fact, shown a lot of flair for entrepreneurship, for industrial development. And the rise of the Chinese economy is one of the great economic miracles of history, and there are a lot of Chinese, so they don’t have to be as good at anything as the West to become the world’s biggest power. So that was kind of the case for China. But at this point, it turns out that authoritarian governments can move very effectively, but they can also make very big mistakes. Because nobody can tell the leader that he’s getting it wrong. It turns out that there are a fair number of indications that China is falling into what some economists call the middle-income trap — that you can develop very rapidly, up to a point, but getting beyond that point is not that easy — that the full transition to becoming a complete first-world economy is something that only a handful of countries have actually managed. And it’s starting to look like China may not be one of them. And of course, although there are a lot of Chinese there, the working-age population has been declining. So the inevitability of Chinese dominance — well, it doesn’t look very inevitable anymore. It’s way too early to know. But it is starting to have a feel that this is a little bit like Japan, early ‘90s, when everybody knew that Japan was going to take over the world. And they didn’t. And so China’s much bigger than Japan, but it also has never actually achieved anything like Japanese levels of productivity. So maybe not.

ezra klein

Do you at this point think of A.I. as being a potential, significant economic shock for good or for ill? Or do you think that people are missing something about how it’ll interact with the economy?

paul krugman

No, I think that’s quite possibly a significant economic shock. There’s a lot of white-collar employment — involves things that could plausibly be taken over by — we’re all calling it A.I. It’s not entirely clear that it really is well, we can argue definitions. But certainly, the kinds of things that we’re now seeing — and this has been happening, by the way, for a while. It’s been lower key, but we’ve been seeing a lot of creeping mechanization of things that used to think only human beings could do. And now, it’s really accelerating. And it’s highly visible, and it could possibly displace quite a lot of jobs. It’s funny, when I see people who are worried about this, described as Luddites, the Luddites were actually mostly skilled workers. They were weavers, who suddenly found their skills devalued by the development of the power loom. And they weren’t wrong to feel that machinery was hurting them, and it’s not hard to imagine that this could happen to a lot of people. On the other hand, if you’ve been in this economics business for a long time. There have been multiple times when people made predictions that everything is about to change. It hasn’t happened. So I think you just have to reserve judgment on this one.

ezra klein

The thing that brings up for me is, this seems like a real moment where the technology is moving very fast. And the policy conversation — if there is any at all — is very slow. And you obviously want to be careful about trying to think about policy for technologies that we still don’t really understand. But if you were thinking about areas of policy to think about, in a world where maybe the next 10, 15 years are really, really disruptive, from this perspective, what kinds of things would you think about?

paul krugman

Well, I wish I was more creative on these things. When I try to think about how do we deal with rapid change, being a pretty boring, kind of a conventional Social Democrat, who says, look, change happens. You can’t preserve jobs that technology no longer considers necessary. You can’t stop progress. But you can try to cushion people from some of the worst effects. There’s Social Democratic agenda of strong insurance that makes sure that people aren’t impoverished or without health care, if a machine happens to take their job. That does a lot. It doesn’t do everything; it doesn’t restore dignity if your identity if your sense of self is bound up with being in the past. We had people who were proud of being coal miners, and then suddenly, technology said, we don’t actually really need coal minrs anymore, because we just blow the tops off mountains. You can give those people health care and give them food stamps. You can’t give them the life they had before. Now, it may be claims adjusters who are suddenly find that what they were doing is no longer necessary, and I don’t have great ideas there. I don’t think that the — we try and try retraining. But that has never actually been hugely successful as a way of coping with economic change. Probably just need to try a bunch of stuff, hope that some of it works, but mostly, what we can do is we can at least limit the amount of misery.

ezra klein

I guess a good place to end. So as our final question, what are the three books you’d recommend to the audience?

paul krugman

OK, so first off, Brad DeLong, my friend, an economist and historian, has this wonderful book called “Slouching Towards Utopia,” which is a history of what he calls the long 20th century. And if you just want to understand how the world changed from — he says that 1870 was the pivot point of history — you’ve got to read that book. I have recently reread “How the War Was Won” by Phillips O’Brien, who’s a military historian. And it’s a book about World War II, but he’s become a prolific commentator on the war in Ukraine, and it’s mostly — it’s this wonderfully unromantic, anti-glory view of war. It’s all about, look, it’s really about — modern war is about production and logistics. The opening sentence is, I think, “There were no decisive battles of World War II.” And it opened my eyes to thinking about how both about that history and about how to think about what’s happening in Ukraine now. I just read a fantasy novel by Leigh Bardugo called “Ninth House,” which is set at Yale. So I was a Yale undergraduate. And if you know Yale, there are these secret societies that people of a certain type get — you can’t apply, you just get tapped for them and then become a lifelong member of Skull and Bones or whatever. I was never, obviously, going to be tapped for that. I was the nerd, the nerd universe at Yale. But the conceit of the book is that the secret societies are, in fact, evil places that carry out dark satanic rituals, and it was just so much fun to have my college re-represented as a place of dark and terrible secrets.

It’s State of the Union week!

Already, I can hear some of you grumbling: Nope. No way I’m blowing my Tuesday night on that snoozefest when there are episodes of “The Last of Us” to rewatch.

I get the lack of enthusiasm. It’s tempting to dismiss the president’s annual address to Congress as old-fashioned, heavy-handed political theater — largely because it is old-fashioned, heavy-handed political theater. You’ve got the stuffy setting, the strict staging, the meticulous scripting, the hackneyed performances and even occasional audience members nodding off — either from boredom or because they liquored up before the show.

But this does not mean that the State of the Union, more adorably known as SOTU, is empty political theater. Far from it — especially this year, when there is so much real-life drama to watch for. With President Biden assumed to be gearing up for a re-election run, he will be test driving issues and messages with campaign potential. What will resonate — or not? Having finally groveled his way into the speaker of the House’s seat just behind the president, how will Kevin McCarthy comport himself on this big night, especially if his members start getting balky? This will be the first SOTU for the Supreme Court justices after the conservative majority torpedoed the constitutional right to abortion last summer. Will Mr. Biden mention their ruling? Will they register a response? Will there be any points in this speech for which both congressional teams applaud? Who will deign to sit with the House’s new serial fabulist, George Santos? And will Representative Matt Gaetz be so characteristically obnoxious that his Republican colleague Mike Rogers comes at him again, as happened during last month’s historically awkward election for speaker?

The entire spectacle is an elaborate exercise in political signaling by the president, his congressional allies, the opposition and even bit players like the Supremes. Every clap, grimace and eye roll tells us something about the prevailing mood among the nation’s top leaders — and the level of discord and dysfunction we can look forward to in the coming months."

California’s current overall minimum wage, at $15.50, already exceeds most other states (Washington State’s and the District of Columbia’s are higher) and will increase to $16 on Jan. 1. Californians will vote in November 2024 on whether to push it up even more, to $18 an hour.

Lopezlira said that the two new laws were a testament to the growing power and popularity of organized labor nationwide. Public support for unions among Americans hasn’t been this high in Gallup polls since the 1960s.

But that deadline to restore democracy or face military action expired on Sunday.

After mutinous soldiers detained Niger’s democratically elected president on July 26, the Economic Community of West African States, or ECOWAS, gave the junta the ultimatum, raising fears of a regional conflict in a part of Africa that includes some of the world’s poorest countries and that is already plagued by Islamist insurgencies, widespread food insecurity and the extreme effects of climate change.

But the ultimatum also rallied many Nigeriens behind their new military leaders. On Sunday, tens of thousands of defiant junta supporters thronged the largest stadium in the capital, Niamey, voicing their anger against ECOWAS and chanting the name of the military official who claims to be in charge, Gen. Abdourahmane Tchiani.

West African officials said that they would employ force only as a last resort, and most analysts said that a conflict appeared unlikely, at least in the near term. But ECOWAS military officials said that they did have a plan for an intervention, if needed."

It turns out that over the years Thomas, who has portrayed himself as a man of modest tastes who likes to hang out in Walmart parking lots, has taken many lavish — and previously undisclosed — vacations at Crow’s expense. The ethical questions seem obvious.

Still, The Wall Street Journal lashed out at ProPublica, with an editorial headlined “The Smearing of Clarence Thomas.” The article accused ProPublica of using loaded language to create the appearance of a scandal. For example, the paper complained, ProPublica’s report called Crow’s 162-foot private boat, which has been featured in places like the website Superyacht Fan, a “superyacht.” Smear tactics!

Actually, according to a 2022 article in The New Yorker, any yacht over 98 feet long is considered a superyacht within the yachting community.

Which got me thinking about big yachts and what they tell us about the state of society.

When rich people can afford to buy and operate big yachts, they do. Indeed, yachts are a highly visible indicator of inequality, the concentration of income and wealth in the hands of the few. The Gilded Age was marked by a proliferation of ever bigger, ever more elaborately furnished yachts; when J.P. Morgan built a large steam yacht, its 1898 launch was featured in The New York Times."

“Of an Age”: Set in the late 1990s, in Melbourne’s unglamorous outer suburbs, this queer love story from the director Goran Stolevski recounts the power of a fleeting 24-hour encounter between a teenager and the older brother of his errant best friend.

The film is nostalgic, but not for the Australian suburbs nor the era, which Stolevski depicts unsparingly as claustrophobic and sometimes simply bigoted. Rather, for the joy of unexpected connection with an attractive stranger and the promise of unwritten adult life unspooling ahead of the two young protagonists."

There are still legions of Democrats down here, as well as a growing number of voters who are left of the mainstream Democratic Party, but they are clustered in college towns and growing cities like Nashville, where they live and work shoulder to shoulder with old-school conservatives and rabid Donald Trump supporters alike. Joe Biden won Nashville with almost 65 percent of the vote.

But thanks to a brutally gerrymandered election map, we didn’t send a moderate Democrat, one who could reasonably represent the interests of both Nashville liberals and Nashville conservatives, to Washington this year. Instead, the newly mutilated Nashville is represented by three of the most militant right-wingers the state has ever elected.

This particular injustice likely seems irrelevant to anybody who doesn’t live here. Occurring as it does among so many other political injustices in a nation moving rapidly toward minority rule, even the utter disenfranchisement of an entire American city is hard to get very worked up about.

But you ought to be worked up about it. You ought to be protesting in the streets about it because what is happening in Tennessee, and in so many other states governed by Republican supermajorities, goes a long way toward explaining what is happening in the U.S. Congress.

Andy Ogles, for example, is the newly elected congressman from Tennessee’s redrawn Fifth District, a seat held for two decades by Jim Cooper back when the seat still included all of Nashville. In Washington, Mr. Ogles immediately allied himself with the nihilist wing of the Republican Party, voting 11 times against Kevin McCarthy in the speakership contest. In Nashville, then, we have gone from being represented by a member of the Blue Dog Coalition of fiscally conservative Democrats to being represented by a founding member of what might well be called the Dead Dog Caucus. What else should we call legislators who have no interest in legislating?"

The Roman Catholic Church “repudiates those concepts that fail to recognize the inherent human rights of Indigenous peoples, including what has become known as the legal and political ‘Doctrine of Discovery,’” a joint statement from the Vatican’s development and education offices said. The doctrine is “not part of the teaching of the Catholic Church,” it said, and the documents in question “have never been considered expressions of the Catholic faith.”

Demands that the doctrine be discredited grew last summer when Pope Francis, the first pope from Latin America, visited Canada to apologize to Indigenous communities for the church’s role in ​the country’s notorious residential school system, ​​where thousands of Indigenous children were physically and sexually abused, and in some cases, died.

In Lula’s first two terms in office, which ended in 2010, this onetime revolutionary trade unionist crusaded against the World Trade Organization, pushed for a permanent Brazilian seat on the U.N. Security Council, and recognized Palestine as an independent state. Similarly, Macron’s rhetoric follows Jacques Chirac’s rebuke of George W. Bush over the Iraq war, as well as the chorus of European leaders during the Trump years insisting that the continent could easily drift from America’s side and go it alone.

But these days Lula and Macron look less like world leaders seizing the limelight to speak out of turn and more like avatars of an emergent, more fluid geopolitics. For my money, one of the best places to read about it is a newsletter published by Phenomenal World and spearheaded by Kate Mackenzie and Tim Sahay — named, actually, Polycrisis — that has been incisively documenting the emerging shape of this “new nonalignment”: India’s Narendra Modi negotiating green-energy agreements, tech transfers and weapons deals with the European Union shortly after a high-profile summit with China; refusal across the developing world to take a side in the Ukraine conflict; the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen talking of “derisking” rather than “decoupling” from China.

For Americans squinting bleary-eyed into the post-pandemic world, this landscape may look a bit disorienting. Last week, during International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings in Washington, the former Treasury secretary Lawrence Summers half-jokingly complained that it was getting “lonely” on what he called “the right side of history.” He went on, “There’s a growing acceptance of fragmentation, and — maybe even more troubling — I think there’s a growing sense that ours may not be the best fragment to be associated with.”

But American fears of a great shift may well overstate the size of the change, ultimately — a reflection of our tendency to measure the direction of world history less against the benchmarks of the past than against our expectations for the future (whether those are the unipolar predictions of the 1990s or the “bipolar” forecasts of the last decade). Is it truly a New Cold War, for instance, if the vast majority of our phones, most of what goes into our solar panels, and a critical share of antibiotics used by Americans are produced in China, despite growing tensions between Washington and Beijing? Are we really watching deglobalization unfold, if despite some new trade protectionism, world trade’s share of the global economy has, at worst, only slightly declined since the financial crisis? Does it make sense to panic about “de-dollarification” when 88 percent of foreign exchange trades involve American currency?

This is not to say that nothing is changing, or that those changes aren’t disruptive, only that in our rush to shape a narrative for the near future some stories may be getting ahead of some facts. To me, that is one of the strengths of “multipolarity” as an idea — it is less a finished map of a new world system than a statement about the direction of drift."

Things aren’t getting easier for Disney’s Robert Iger, including yet another poor showing at the box office this weekend. So reports that the media giant’s C.E.O. has brought back two former heirs apparent, Kevin Mayer and Tom Staggs, to advise on the future of Disney’s legacy TV businesses were sure to get Hollywood talking.

It’s not clear what will come of their return to the company, where they were senior executives during Iger’s first stint as chief executive. But their mere presence underscores the amount of work that lies ahead at the House of Mouse.

Mr. Mayer and Mr. Staggs will help Iger think about “linear” TV properties like ABC, according to Puck. The legacy TV division is a business that Wall Street has been focused on since Mr. Iger effectively put a for-sale sign on it this month by saying the unit may not be “core” to the company’s future. A related issue is the fate of ESPN: Mr. Iger has said that the company was seeking a strategic partner for the sports network.

Both men had once been tipped as potential successors to Iger — Mr. Mayer as head of M.&A. and the architect of its streaming strategy; Mr. Staggs as C.F.O. — before leaving as their chances faded. (Mr. Iger chose Bob Chapek to take over, but he was ousted after two years and replaced by … Mr. Iger.) Mr. Mayer and Mr. Staggs now run Candle Media, an investment company that has bought an array of production studios."

That’s because a vast majority of homes in this country are bought using 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages. If you locked in a rate of 3 percent last year, your monthly payment will stay the same for the next three decades, no matter what happens with interest rates, home prices or overall inflation.

In Britain, mortgage rates have also risen rapidly. But the impact of higher rates looks very different. That’s because most mortgages there have fixed rates for only two to five years. (Others have variable rate mortgages that automatically change whenever the Bank of England raises or lowers interest rates.) As my colleague Eshe Nelson reported recently, millions of Britons expect their interest rates to jump up over the next year. Inevitably, some of them won’t be able to afford the resulting higher payments, and will be forced to leave their homes.

Winners and losers

There’s no question that, for most U.S. homeowners, the stability that their fixed-rate mortgages provides is a huge benefit right now, effectively insulating them from both the effects of high inflation and rising mortgage rates.

But not everyone comes out ahead. In the U.S., you can’t take your mortgage with you when you move to a new home. As a result, homeowners who might have been planning to relocate over the next few years — to trade up to a bigger house, for example, or to downsize after the kids head to college — now have a strong incentive to stay put and hold on to their low interest rate.

As a result, fewer people are listing their homes for sale, which in turn is keeping home prices high even as the housing market has slowed by other measures. That means that anyone hoping to buy a first home now faces a quadruple whammy: There aren’t many homes to buy. The homes that are available are expensive. Rising interest rates are sapping buyers’ power. And if they don’t buy, then they have to keep paying rent — which is also going up."

The coming fight could imperil the crucial annual measure to provide a pay raise for troops, set defense policy to counter U.S. adversaries and sustain Pentagon programs at a time of rising threats.

The House passed the measure on a vote of 219 to 210 with nearly unanimous Republican support, a significant victory for the far-right faction that forced a reluctant Speaker Kevin McCarthy to open the bill to an array of social policy prescriptions by threatening to block it if they did not get their way. But the move left the fate of the measure deeply in doubt, advancing a bill that has little chance of passing the Democratic-controlled Senate and raising questions about whether a compromise can be reached that could be enacted into law this fall.

And the outcome suggested even more intense battles ahead on Capitol Hill to avert a government shutdown. Mr. McCarthy’s capitulation to the right, despite knowing it could cost him critical Democratic support for the must-pass bill, was a gamble that could become a playbook for the coming fight over federal spending, where hard-liners are pressing to impose similar socially conservative policies governmentwide.

Some Republicans, particularly those in competitive districts, could also pay a political price for embracing legislation that would restrict the rights of women and transgender people and downplay problems of racism in the military. Democrats were already attacking them for having done so, highlighting the measure as a prime example of their argument that the Republican Party is extreme and out of step with the values of mainstream voters."

But they are the same story: The system that treats human beings as disposable commodities upholds and reproduces itself by sprinkling some fairy dust and hoping that we will forget the injustice that paid for it.

Then, of course, there was Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced crypto kingpin whose spectacular downfall, along with that of FTX, the company he founded, caused $32 billion to disappear, much of it belonging to hundreds of thousands of regular people.

Mr. Bankman-Fried embodies another pretension of plutocratic benevolence: that of the renegade, the people’s billionaire. Like many others, he hawked cryptocurrency as a fight against the establishment, against the big banks, against the powers that be, man. He has said his work was motivated by the ideals of effective altruism, a trendy school of thought that encourages people to go out and make as big a heap of money as they can so that they can use it to heal the world. But, as he admitted in an interview this week with Kelsey Piper of Vox, Mr. Bankman-Fried’s claims about the ethical nature of his pursuit were an example of “this dumb game we woke Westerners play where we say all the right shibboleths and so everyone likes us.”

Finally, of course, this week there was Donald Trump (because let’s face it, there’s always Donald Trump), who has incarnated the most dangerous billionaire pretension of all: that of the hero who in all the world is the only one who can save us. He gamed the system so effectively that only he knows how to un-game it; he manipulated politicians so much that only he knows how to drain the swamp; he amassed so much money that only he is above corruption.

On Tuesday night he addressed a crowded room at Mar-a-Lago and, as expected, announced that he was going to run for president again. He said the usual things that politicians are supposed to say, about how he was doing it for America’s benefit. But this time it was no longer possible to imagine that even he believed it. After all, only a week had passed since America had voted in the midterm elections and rejected most of the high-profile candidates he endorsed — in the process, even Republican commentators agree, rejecting him. He dragged the party down so far that it did not regain the Senate and only barely regained the House."

The U.A.W.’s strike against the big three Detroit carmakers appears unlikely to end soon, with the two sides giving little sign that either will bend significantly.

It’s the latest signal of organized labor’s resurgent combativeness across the nation from Detroit to Hollywood, including a willingness to head to the picket line. Fueling that confidence is strong support from Americans, the White House and even some Republicans.

The U.A.W. is prepared to play hardball for a while, as it pursues demands like a 40 percent pay increase over four years, shorter workweeks and an end to a tiered wage system. Its president, Shawn Fain, on Sunday rejected a proposal by Stellantis, the owner of Jeep and Chrysler, to raise pay 21 percent over four years.

A big help is the union’s novel strategy of targeting all three Detroit automakers — Ford, General Motors and Stellantis — at once, instead of taking them on indivudually, as well as striking just a few key factories at a time. The plan isn’t without risk, since it requires more coordination among U.A.W. workers, but experts say it gives the union more leverage and preserves its strike fund for longer."

And at times, he’s made it hard to argue with that. He has said he’d welcome former President Donald J. Trump back on Twitter; suggested that Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband was lying about the attack at their home that left him hospitalized; and reinstated accounts that have trafficked in offensive ethnic stereotypes and bigotry, including for the artist formerly known as Kanye West.

According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the government’s official drought-tracking service, more than 90 percent of the state was in severe or extreme drought."

Grocery stores in Mammoth experienced food shortages because of highway closures during the most recent squall. Some residents were parking their cars at the high school or the airport because their own lots were storing so much snow. There was a run on fuel earlier in the month, because oil delivery trucks couldn’t get into town and the propane tanks that store fuel here were all buried.

While thousands of people lined up on Saturday to hit the slopes, hundreds of others in town were focused on clearing snow. On street after street, crews of three and four were working to remove the more than six feet of snow that had accumulated on the roofs of houses, apartment complexes and businesses, threatening to drop massive cornices and human-size icicles at any time.

That much snow, when left untouched, can lead to problems like leaks, structural compression, caved-in ceilings or serious water damage, not to mention injury or worse. Though it had been days since the most recent snowfall ended, teams were still working 14- to 16-hour days to clear it.

“In a year like this, there’s just never enough people to keep up,” said Ben Atwood, the owner of Plow Brothers, a snow removal business. “It’s insanity.”"

She kept photographing her own, and filmed others moving around her.

It was a transparent metaphor for the feelings she was working through, because Brook’s parents have cast a long shadow over her life and career. Her latest work, “House of Us,” which opens in Venice on Nov. 29, is dedicated to her mother, the English actress Natasha Parry, whose rich stage and screen career lasted more than six decades. As for her father? You may have heard of Peter Brook, one of the most influential theater directors of the past century, who died this year, in Paris, at age 97.

Brook, 60, is only just coming to terms with her family history, by laying much of it bare in “House of Us.” In this immersive work, which will be staged over two floors at Casa dei Tre Oci, a Venetian palazzo turned art space, visitors wander through a series of rooms inspired by Brook’s life, and her mother’s.

Some are dreamlike reinventions of Parry’s bedroom and dressing room; another is a close reproduction of Brook’s kitchen, furnished with her possessions. (She shipped her kitchen table to Venice for the production.)

After more than six months of deliberation, President Biden appeared on the verge of agreeing to ship cluster munitions to Ukraine. These are widely banned weapons known to cause grievous injury to civilians, and the step would sharply separate the U.S. from allies like Britain, Germany and France who have signed a treaty banning their use, stockpiling or transfer.

Several of Biden’s top aides, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, recommended the move last week, despite what they have described as deep reservations around both humanitarian concerns and worries that the U.S. would be drastically out of step with its allies, people familiar with the discussions said.

Ukraine, which has deployed cluster munitions of its own in the war, is burning through the available supply of conventional artillery shells, and it will take time to ramp up production. Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, has put pressure on Biden, arguing that the munitions — which disperse tiny bomblets — are the best way to kill Russians in trenches.

Context: For months, the Biden administration has tried to put off the decision, hoping that the tide of the war would turn in Ukraine’s favor. Part of the concern has been that the U.S. would appear to lose the moral high ground, using a weapon that much of the world has condemned and that Russia has used with abandon, and that Democrats abhor."

I found it harder to pay attention to other events and processes that took longer or played out less sensationally even if I cared about them — like the local effects of climate change, grass-roots housing campaigns or even just the details of friends’ lives. I felt like my thoughts were running on shorter loops or never getting completed. Even my breaths were short, as though a full inhale couldn’t fit into such tiny intervals, and my joints would ache from a state of constant anticipation. It was the feeling of a furrowed brow, applied to my entire body. Most haunting was a sense that I had no substance, and that the physical world, with all its minute fluctuations and gradual changes, was somehow losing its color and texture.

In the past few years, in part because of how frayed my mind felt, I started avoiding my Twitter and Instagram feeds altogether. From this remove, I sat down and wrote out on paper what it was that I really wanted from these platforms. The answer ended up being a sense of recognition among peers, connection to people with shared interests and whose work I admire and the ability to encounter new, unexpected ideas. As opposed to algorithms, I wanted these new things to be recommended by individuals who had reasons to like them, like the weekly set on my local college radio station by a D.J. whose wide-ranging taste I’m at pains to describe, but reliably enjoy. Really, I think I just wanted everything to have a little more context.

With this in mind, I slowly started piecing something else together — at the time, a mix of emails, group chats and RSS feeds. But finding more context often means going more slowly and as I did so, I was confronted by my old habits and expectations around time and pacing. Information no longer came in through one nonstop fire hose, and even though that was precisely what I had complained about, the change made me uncomfortable and dissatisfied. Was something missing? The management scholar Allen C. Bluedorn has written that patterns of entrainment can persist in an organization long after the original zeitgeber is gone, and this is a bit like what happened to me. Years of inhabiting a temporal attitude had left a deep indentation on my mind, as if I were waking up early for a job I no longer had.

Over time, the indentation softened, and I got used to a different definition of what it meant to be connected. In the absence of the constant updates, signs of other tempos began to enter the picture: the migratory ducks arriving in the lake nearby, the long email from a friend that only comes once every few months and requires my full attention, the unglamorous city council meeting, the long, historical arc of something just now cresting in the news. My breathing, eating, sleeping body felt more real, with more traction among the sensory minutiae of the everyday. I even felt I could see further in both directions: into my past with all its failures and triumphs, and into the future where I might do something as-yet unimaginable. But what I’m describing is not a linear progression or a once-and-for-all kind of story. Now and then, I get remagnetized to that old clock and have to remember to step away.

Of course, not everyone is so lucky. Entrainment to tempos in work, health or child care aren’t so much individual choices as they are reflections of power relationships, and many would require collective action or outside support to adjust. But for many of us, plugging into the pace of mainstream social media may not be as necessary as it feels. If the experience I’ve described sounds familiar to you, try stepping away. See if some of the things you originally came to social media looking for, including things you’ve never found, might be available through slower, less commercial channels, which have less of an incentive to suck you in."

America, it’s true, will never again enjoy the degree of global economic and political domination it exercised in the decades after the war. But it can, with the right choices, look forward to a future in which it remains the world’s pre-eminent nation.

To call America an empire is admittedly to court controversy or at least confusion. After all, the United States claims dominion over no countries and even prodded its allies to renounce their colonies. But there’s an illuminating precedent for the kind of imperial project the United States forged after the war: the Roman Empire.

By the fourth century, that empire had evolved from a conquest state into one where the Eternal City remained a spiritual center but actual power was shared across the provinces, with two centers of imperial authority: one in the east and another in the west. In return for collecting taxes, provincial landholding elites enjoyed the protection of the legions, their loyalty to the empire cemented by a real share in its benefits and what the historian Peter Heather calls a unifying culture of Latin, towns and togas.

Like modern America, Rome attained a degree of supremacy unprecedented in its day. But the paradox of great imperial systems is that they often sow the seeds of their own downfall. As Rome grew rich and powerful from the economic exploitation of its peripheries, it inadvertently spurred the development of territories beyond its European frontiers. In time, the larger and politically more coherent confederations that emerged acquired the ability to parry — and eventually roll back — imperial domination.

In the same way, America’s decline is a product of its success. Although developing countries grew more slowly in the postwar period than their Western counterparts, they still grew. By the end of the century, they had started to convert that expanding economic clout into political and diplomatic power. Not only had they begun to acquire the capacity to negotiate better trade and financial agreements, but they also had a crucial bargaining chip in the form of two resources Western businesses now needed: growing markets and abundant supplies of labor."

The change is particularly noticeable at the driving range. Using geolocation data, one study found that there were 278 percent more people playing golf at 4 p.m. on a Wednesday in August 2022 than in August 2019. Hair salons, gyms and others in the service industry have also felt the shift.

The document cites eight ways in which Trump and 18 other defendants allegedly obstructed the election. Among them:

Lying to the Georgia legislature and state officials

Creating a fake pro-Trump slate for the Electoral College

Harassing election workers

Engaging in a cover-up

The conduct that prosecutors described goes beyond Georgia, incorporating Trump and his aides’ attempts to overturn the 2020 election results in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and other states. The top charge was brought under a type of law originally created to prosecute the Mafia.

“The indictment alleges that rather than abide by Georgia’s legal process for election challenges, the defendants engaged in a criminal racketeering enterprise to overturn Georgia’s presidential election result,” Fani Willis, the district attorney in Fulton County who led the investigation, said at a news conference late last night."

Driving on electricity is generally much cheaper than gasoline. Scores of respondents said they were using energy they generated from rooftop solar panels to charge their cars, potentially lowering costs even further.

Electric car buyers used words like “love” and “awesome” to describe their vehicles. Many said they would never buy a gasoline car again, but many others said they intended to keep at least one conventional vehicle, because traveling long distances by electric car can be inconvenient and sometimes impossible because of difficulties in finding charging stations.

Electric vehicles are now becoming popular in places other than where they took off, like California, where 39 percent of all U.S. electric vehicles were registered as of June, according to data from the Department of Energy. Registrations outside California jumped 50 percent in 2021, compared with a 32 percent increase in the state.

In the long run, much wider use of electric vehicles will require many more affordable models. The Leaf and the Chevrolet Bolt are among the few lower-cost battery-powered cars available, with several on the way, including a Chevrolet Equinox sport utility vehicle, which will start at around $30,000. But it may be a while before there are enough affordable models, including used cars, which sell in much greater numbers than new vehicles. For now, Tesla, Ford Motor, Mercedes-Benz and other companies have focused on premium models that are more profitable.

Yet, many buyers are concluding that electric vehicles make economic sense even when they cost thousands of dollars more than similar gasoline vehicles."

A Supreme Court justice has allowed wealthy political donors to finance a lavish lifestyle for him and his wife (and that same justice’s wife urged officials to overturn the 2020 presidential election result based on lies).

“To many watching at home and abroad, the American way no longer seems to offer a case study in effective representative democracy,” Peter Baker of The Times writes. “Instead, it has become an example of disarray and discord, one that rewards extremism, challenges norms and threatens to divide a polarized country even further.”

Fractured and extreme

Many factors have contributed to this turmoil. Decades of stagnant living standards have caused voter frustration. Social media, along with the rise of a cable television network willing to promote falsehoods, has inflamed discourse. The decline of institutions — churches, labor unions, once-dominant local employers — has left Americans feeling unmoored. And aging political leaders have failed to groom strong successors.

But the single largest source of the chaos is the Republican Party.

I don’t say that lightly. Readers of this newsletter know that I think there is plenty of evidence that the Democratic Party also has problems. It has struggled in recent years to come up with effective policies on Covid school closures, illegal immigration and several other issues. Many working-class voters consider the party to be disdainful of them, which helps explain why its longtime troubles with white voters have recently spread to voters of color."

Officials are trying to head off a possible federal court takeover of the complex.

The idea of turning Rikers into a green energy hub has been circulating since the City Council mandated the shutdown of the jails in 2027. That will leave Rikers empty, a large parcel of land in the East River close to La Guardia Airport.

“If the era of jailing on Rikers is ending,” said Moses Gates, a vice president of the Regional Plan Association, which commissioned a report on Rikers as a green infrastructure center, “we have to think about a vision.” That idea was echoed in the report, which said it would “likely take generations to repair the harm Rikers has done to Black, Brown and poor New Yorkers, but we need to start somewhere.”

Gates credited the idea of Rikers as a green hub to the Renewable Rikers Coalition, an alliance of groups representing people who had been incarcerated there that was part of a steering panel that guided the report. “We’re going to need a great deal of green infrastructure if we’re going to come close to meeting our climate goals,” Gates said.

The report said there would be room on Rikers Island for equipment to generate 275 megawatts of solar power, enough to power roughly 45,000 homes, and to store another 1,500 megawatts. That would clear the way to phase out several nearby gas-fired power plants known as “peakers” that are not the main providers of energy but are needed a few days each year when energy demand is at its peak."

Chinese propaganda has tried to score points against the Biden administration, mocking it as flailing, overreacting and trying to outflank its hard-right Republican opponents to demonstrate who can stand taller against Beijing. Nowhere in China’s response has the government acknowledged the balloon’s cost to its own credibility and the mounting evidence that it was all too willing to spy on its neighbors and beyond."

With that recent experience fresh in mind, NATO foreign ministers at a meeting in Bucharest have engaged in their most concerted effort yet to grapple with the China challenge, despite their preoccupation with the war in Ukraine.

Antony J. Blinken, the U.S. Secretary of State, said Wednesday that NATO had agreed to take further concrete steps to address the growing strategic challenge from China, including trying to coordinate export controls on technology and security reviews of Chinese investments."

The charge included costs for the early termination of some office-space leases, redesigns of some data center projects and severance for employees who were laid off last year. The company expects another $1 billion in restructuring costs in 2023.

The charge dragged down Meta’s profits, with net income falling 55 percent to $4.65 billion in the fourth quarter from a year ago. Meta also continued to spend heavily on Mr. Zuckerberg’s shift to the so-called metaverse, with costs rising 22 percent from a year earlier.

Revenue fell 4 percent to $32.16 billion from a year earlier, coming in at the higher end of the company’s guidance and above Wall Street predictions.

When you do, you’ll realize this isn’t really a debate only about A.I. It’s also a contest about control and power, about how resources should be distributed and who should be held accountable.

Beneath this roiling discord is a true fight over the future of society. Should we focus on avoiding the dystopia of mass unemployment, a world where China is the dominant superpower or a society where the worst prejudices of humanity are embodied in opaque algorithms that control our lives? Should we listen to wealthy futurists who discount the importance of climate change because they’re already thinking ahead to colonies on Mars? It is critical that we begin to recognize the ideologies driving what we are being told. Resolving the fracas requires us to see through the specter of A.I. to stay true to the humanity of our values.

One way to decode the motives behind the various declarations is through their language. Because language itself is part of their battleground, the different A.I. camps tend not to use the same words to describe their positions. One faction describes the dangers posed by A.I. through the framework of safety, another through ethics or integrity, yet another through security and others through economics. By decoding who is speaking and how A.I. is being described, we can explore where these groups differ and what drives their views.

The Doomsayers

The loudest perspective is a frightening, dystopian vision in which A.I. poses an existential risk to humankind, capable of wiping out all life on Earth. A.I., in this vision, emerges as a godlike, superintelligent, ungovernable entity capable of controlling everything. A.I. could destroy humanity or pose a risk on par with nukes. If we’re not careful, it could kill everyone or enslave humanity. It’s likened to monsters like the Lovecraftian shoggoths, artificial servants that rebelled against their creators, or paper clip maximizers that consume all of Earth’s resources in a single-minded pursuit of their programmed goal. It sounds like science fiction, but these people are serious, and they mean the words they use.

These are the A.I. safety people, and their ranks include the “Godfathers of A.I.,” Geoff Hinton and Yoshua Bengio. For many years, these leading lights battled critics who doubted that a computer could ever mimic capabilities of the human mind. Having steamrollered the public conversation by creating large language models like ChatGPT and other A.I. tools capable of increasingly impressive feats, they appear deeply invested in the idea that there is no limit to what their creations will be able to accomplish."

And now, some Republicans are warning that their party’s poor standing with millennial and Gen-Z voters could become an existential threat. But there’s no consensus about how much, if at all, Republicans’ message needs to change.

“We’re going to lose a heck of a lot of elections if we wait until these people become Republicans,” said John Brabender, a G.O.P. consultant who has been sounding the alarm about the party’s deficit with younger voters.

By 2024, those two generations combined could make up as much as 40 percent of the voting public, according to some estimates. So far, millennials — some of whom are entering their 40s — are betraying little sign of growing more conservative as they age. If those trends hold, it could make for some daunting electoral math for the right."

John Kenneth Galbraith, the 6-foot-8-inch economist and diplomat, suggested that favoring the tall was “one of the most blatant and forgiven prejudices in our society.” Others go to extremes in pursuit of a few extra inches — more and more people are spending as much as $150,000 to get excruciating limb-lengthening surgeries, and parents give their healthy children growth hormone treatments with unknown side effects.

I know this because I was one of those children. As a preteen, I injected Humatrope into my thighs for three and a half years, at the behest of my parents, who feared I’d be alienated for being short. I understand why they felt that way, given how short people are treated in our society — a song with the lyric “Short people got no reason to live” was No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 just a few years before I was born.

Now I have twins who are among the smallest in their kindergarten class, but instead of preparing to medicate them because of an antiquated societal bias, I’m going to let them be as they are: tiny. Because short is better, and it is the future.

We talk about short stature in a positive light only once every four years, when Simone Biles dazzles us in a leotard. That has left the many advantages enjoyed by short people underappreciated. On average, short people live longer and have a lower incidence of cancer. One theory suggests this is the case because with fewer cells, there is less likelihood that one goes wrong. I’d take that over dunking a basketball any day.

The short are also inherent conservationists, which is more crucial than ever in this world of eight billion people. Thomas Samaras, who has been studying height for 40 years and is known in small circles as the Godfather of Shrink Think, a widely unknown philosophy that considers small superior, calculated that if we kept our proportions the same but were just 10 percent shorter in America alone, we would save 87 million tons of food per year (not to mention trillions of gallons of water, quadrillions of B.T.U.s of energy and millions of tons of trash)."

Microsoft’s decision last month to invest $10 billion in OpenAI, makers of the chatbot sensation ChatGPT, has been a boon for investors.

But questions and concerns are already mounting. Microsoft has integrated the generative A.I. technology that powers ChatGPT into its own Bing search engine. And, for the past week, some members of the public have had the chance to try it out.

Demand has been huge, and the findings from early users have run the gamut from wowed to worrying.

A few months ago, the U.S. national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, gave a speech that I think is the single clearest distillation of how the Biden administration is thinking about this moment for the global economy. In that speech, he argued that the world is experiencing something of an economic paradigm shift. For a whole host of reasons, from climate change to the rise of China to Russia’s weaponization of its energy resources, the era of unfettered globalization and free markets is ending, and according to Sullivan, we’re entering into a new era that requires very different kinds of policies and institutions. The speech really stood out to me because over the last few years, most economics coverage has been dominated by the inflation story, but this, to me, is the much bigger economic story that’s been simmering in the background. The global economy is undergoing a series of big tectonic shifts, many of which are years and years in the making, and policymakers around the world are trying to figure out how exactly to respond to them. So for a while now, I’ve wanted to spend an episode focused on that bigger story, and in my view, there’s just no better person to do that with than Martin Wolf. Wolf is a former senior economist at the World Bank and currently the chief economics commentator at “Financial Times” as well as the author of numerous books, including most recently the excellent book “The Crisis of Democratic Capitalism.” A few months ago, I happened to be at an event with Wolf, and when I asked him about how he’s thinking about all of this, he outlined this framework that I found to be the most helpful analytical model for understanding this moment in the global economy. And so I asked him to come on the show and walk me through it. As is always the case, the show’s email is ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. Here is Martin Wolf. [MUSIC PLAYING] Martin Wolf, welcome to “The Ezra Klein Show.”

martin wolf

It’s a great pleasure to be with you.

rogé karma

Great pleasure to have you. So I want to start with the big picture. Tell me about your shifts-shocks-fragilities framework and why you think that’s a helpful way to think about the global economy.

martin wolf

Well, I think we have to step back first. It’s obvious, really starting with the global financial crisis, that a lot of things have been happening in a very disorderly and confusing way over the last 15 years, and obviously, these processes started earlier, which have surprised and shocked people. And so the normal way of thinking about the world — let’s just try and forecast the next year or two or three — doesn’t really work very well. One needs a more analytical framework. And I’ve been thinking about this for quite a while with a number of different approaches, but the one I found most useful is to think about where we are in terms of these three aspects of the global environment and focusing very much on the economy. So the first is shifts, by which I mean long-term structural processes that are occurring and are likely to continue to occur over a generation or more, things that most of the time we don’t think about, but they’re constantly changing the environment we’re in. And then the second, rather different set of things are shocks and events that were always conceivable. You couldn’t really forecast them because the probabilities and the processes weren’t known well enough, but they could happen. And it so happens a lot of them have very recently. We’ve been through a period of exceptional shocks in terms of their rapidity and their impact. And the final aspect of the world’s economic system, if you like, is the underlying fragilities, the things that make the shocks so powerful, and those are both economic and political. And the political also includes institutional processes. And I argue that the fragilities are extremely important in understanding why we find it so difficult to cope with both the underlying shifts and the shocks well.

rogé karma

Well, I want to dig into each of these, and I want to start with the shifts because, as you said, they’re the ones we often ignore, even if they are often changing the global economic environment more than anything. So let’s start with the first one. Tell me about the rise of China and how it has shaped the global economy.

martin wolf

Well, this is, I think, probably the most visible and unexpected thing if you look at the world from the point of view of 40 years ago. So I can remember very well because I was working in the World Bank at the time in — I think it was 1980, when, for the very first time, the World Bank was visited by a few Chinese officials, senior ones. And they were wearing Mao suits, and they really seemed to us almost like a visit from Mars. We didn’t know anything about China, its potential impact. The economy was very, very poor, very undeveloped. And we didn’t really think it was particularly important, and we didn’t think about what it meant. Now, four decades later, four decades — this is the fastest economic transformation, I think, in world history, even faster than the rise of the United States in the late 19th century and early 20th century — China is a superpower. And it is part of the biggest part of a broader rise of East and South Asia, which, you have to remember, contains half of the world’s population and which was, one might say, the center of civilization for a very long time. So that China in particular and the broader rise of Asia has completely transformed the balance of economic influence and power and so global power. And it has changed patterns of trade. It has changed the nature of competition, both economic and political. It has changed the Western sense of itself. Remember, this was a world that the West essentially ran for several centuries, and suddenly, we got this non-Western, non-liberal power erupting into the middle of it. So I think that is pretty obviously the biggest shift and the most rapid shift in the world. Today, China and Russia, if you add them together — it depends on your weighting — are about half the economic size of all the Western economies together, and that’s a huge shift in power.

rogé karma

And you started getting at it in that answer, but what are some of the specific ways that the global economy is different today in large part because of the rise of China, because of the rise of South and East Asia? How is it different than it was when you were at the World Bank in 1980 because of these trends?

martin wolf

Well, it’s important to stress — and I’ll come to the ways in which it isn’t really different, and that’s quite important. The most important one of all is the shifts in world trade and world markets. So for many countries around the world, particularly the commodity exporters but also countries quite close to China, this is far and away their biggest market. This is the market whose rise and fall, both in the medium term and in the shorter term, really shapes what’s going on the prices of commodities, their opportunities, and so forth. So that’s on the export side. It has also created a completely new set of suppliers, a new set of competitors. Very large number of developing and emerging countries but also developed countries have found that industries that they thought were well established and stable have been outcompeted by China and have disappeared. And that’s become a very big political factor not just in the U.S. where, clearly, if you look at the background to what President Biden is doing — but also in Europe, the Germans are very worried about Chinese competition. And many developing countries in South America — also India — feel that they’re exposed to the threat of deindustrialization. A lot of the progress they made is being reversed because China is such a phenomenal competitor. And then finally and crucially, because of this new emerging power on these multiple dimensions and the growing difficulty of cooperating with them successfully, we’re beginning to see real fragmentation in the world system. It’s not quite decoupling, very far from it, but there is much less of the sense that there is a single global order overseen by the dominant Western powers, above all the U.S. These are really profound transformations. At the same time, it is important to stress where the West remains absolutely dominant. The world’s dominant currencies are those of the United States and its allies. The dollar remains the single most important currency by far. The Western capital markets financial markets, particularly those based in New York, to a lesser extent London, remain the dominant financial markets. And overall, I would say that — and this is shown with the recent developments in artificial intelligence, that the Western countries remain technologically in the lead. But even there, there’s certainly much more real competition than there used to be, so on multiple dimensions, we live in a very, very different world from the one that we took for granted four decades ago.

rogé karma

There is so much in there I want to follow up on and that we will, but I want to stay with China for a second because I think China’s ascendancy — its continued ascendancy, at least — was considered inevitable a few years ago. But in the last year or two, the narrative has really flipped in a lot of ways. So first, you have the “zero Covid” lockdowns that really hurt the Chinese economy entire. Cities were locked down. Unemployment spiked. There was this major protest movement. But then last December, the country lifted its lockdowns, and the belief was that growth would surge. It would continue on its previous path, and that just hasn’t really happened. Growth for China has been much lower than expected. The unemployment rate among China’s urban youth recently reached the highest number on record, over 20 percent. The country’s real estate sector, which has long been the engine of its growth, looked like it was recovering and then started tumbling again. So given how important China’s rise has been for the global economy, how it’s shifted so many things, what do you make of the trajectory now? What’s actually going on with the Chinese economy, and why hasn’t it gotten back on track as quickly as people expected?

martin wolf

So actually, I’ve written a number of pieces on this possibility, and these were quite a long time ago, six or seven years ago, both in the Financial Times and elsewhere. And I think we have to start by saying it’s not yet clear whether this is a fundamental break in China’s rise or merely an interruption, and that depends partly on what the Chinese do and partly what happens in the world. If it is a break then there’s, of course, a crucial question of how profound the break is, so let’s just consider these aspects. And it really involves understanding what’s going on. So the growth rate that China had up to about 2012 — so a few years after the financial crisis — it was close to 10 percent a year. There wasn’t any doubt that that wasn’t going to be sustained. It was going to slow, and the slowdown occurred partly because export growth couldn’t be sustained at that rate because China had just become too big and it had saturated so many markets. But also, they had done so much of the investment that was needed. Their infrastructure had already become superlative, really almost overdeveloped for the size of the economy as it was, and they needed to find some other way of maintaining growth. And what they went for was the biggest real estate boom or bubble, I think, in world history, which meant that they then started generating huge increases in debt to finance this huge real estate boom on which demand was heavily dependent. And so China, in the last decade or so, started showing many of the characteristics of Western countries before the global financial crisis. I think of it — sometimes, I refer to this as the law of the conservation of financial bubbles. We stopped, and they immediately had to run into one. They blow up one, which is indeed what they did. And it was obvious by 2016 — I was starting to write about it — that was not a sustainable driver of growth in China, and at some point, they were going to stop it. And in the last year or two, three, they really have stopped this. But that, of course, knocked out or weakened a massive part of demand in the economies, and that’s one big structural reason why demand has been weak and growth has been weak and employment has been weak. That’s, as it were, the macroeconomic structural challenge they have. And Japan has faced the same problems since the end of the bubble in the ‘80s, and the bubble in the 80s — and I’ve been writing this for about 30 years — in Japan was motivated by the desire to do exactly the same thing in Japan after their high-growth period ended. So it’s the transition from ultra high growth to merely fast growth that really breaks this debt-accumulation, high-investment model. Then even more, I think, important, certainly as important, is the second huge problem, which goes something like this. The Chinese system tried to achieve something quite extraordinary — and I think only Deng Xiaoping would have had the nerve to do it — which was to combine a communist political system with a capitalist economy. And most of us would have said, can you do that? And asked in 1980, we said it’s impossible. And I think Deng was prepared to do this because he knew they needed the growth, but one consequence of that sort of growth within a Communist system with no rule of law is that corruption clearly exploded. And it was inevitable that it would because all the resources above all the land that capitalists needed to do their business — all this depended on permissions from government. And the officials who provided it — well, quite naturally, they wanted a share of the winnings, and the capitalists were perfectly prepared to give them a share of the winnings. And in the process, the capitalist system and the party system merged, and it started making people feel this was a completely corrupt system. And there was lots of protests about this, and Xi Jinping was clearly — who was obviously a bit of a control freak — also thought this was threatening to the viability of the Communist Party. So what he did then was to crack down on corruption. But if you crack down on corruption, you are cracking down on the market economy in China because the — I’ve written this many times — corruption is part of the system. And so the more he cracks down on corruption, the more difficult it is to sustain the dynamism of China’s capitalist system. Many of the capitalists get frightened. Some of them leave the country. Some of them stop doing the risk-taking they did before. The bureaucrats become more cautious, and the underlying growth dynamic of the system also slows. It seems to me this macroeconomic problem that I’ve described has coincided with this deep problem of how can you run a capitalist economy indefinitely in a politically accessible way within a system in which all power is concentrated in the Communist Party. How do you do that? They don’t know how to do that. Then, of course, along came the great shock — we’re going to get to the most important shocks of the last few years, indeed, the most important — the pandemic, and that really started destabilizing the system, frightened the wits out of the people, constrained economic activity and slowed down the whole engine. And a lot of the growth in a system like this depends on the expectation that growth will continue. As soon as businessmen conclude that actually the economy isn’t going to grow very much, then they conclude, well, we shouldn’t invest so much. And if they decide that they’re not going to invest so much, then the growth will slow and then you are in a trap. And I think their danger is that now they are in moving into such a growth trap, and that means that where China is going to go over the next 20, 30 years is, I think, one of those great uncertainties that we have to contemplate. And other countries — I’ve written a lot about this recently — like India may well be doing better.

rogé karma

Well, let’s talk about that because if the story of the global economy over the last 20, 30 years has been the rise of China, now, for all the reasons we’ve been talking about, we’re beginning to see a pretty significant shift in certain kinds of investments away from China and towards countries like India but also Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia. So for instance, right now, the vast majority of iPhones — and this has been the case for a long time. The vast majority of iPhones are made in China as opposed to about one in 20 in India. But by 2025, the share of iPhones made in India is expected to rise to closer to one in four. And then you have other companies, from Sony, Google, Microsoft, shifting production from China to places like Vietnam and Thailand, and so one prediction, as you sort of alluded to there, is that as China continues to become less and less attractive, both for the structural reasons you talked about in addition to the West’s encirclement of it and the geopolitical risk of investing there, that you’re going to see a shift in the regions and, really, the world’s economic center of gravity away from China specifically and to this broader set of Asian countries centered around India and others. And so I’m wondering what you make of that possibility and then what you think it would mean for the world economy if it did happen.

martin wolf

Now people are really beginning to look at India with interest. And of course, India is like China, inconceivably vast. Its population is now the same size as China’s, and it is expected that in the course of this century, it will become maybe 400 or 500 million or more bigger. So the human resource potential is essentially limitless. Now, hitherto, India did liberalize in the 1990s, and its trade opened. It has never made itself a really successful base for manufacturing production, though it has been quite successful in some aspects of services. There is no doubt that this government in India is very determined to find ways to get India into the production of goods for export, part of the global supply chain within this China-plus-one context, and of course, they would certainly like there to be more services coming from India — consulting, I.T. services, and so forth. There is no doubt there’s potential there. There’s also no doubt that providing the quality of infrastructure, the quality of the bureaucracy, the integration of production systems that China has created will be immeasurably difficult. So my assumption at the moment is that China will remain a central part of supply chains for many products for the foreseeable future, but there will be additional countries playing a part. It will become, as it were, more Asian and less Chinese. From our point of view in the West, this probably means that in the things that China has been so successful at — like you mentioned, the assembly of iPhones and the production of so many other products — it won’t mean things will be so different. And it is also worth stressing that in some areas — and I think one of the most interesting is in automobile manufacture, where China’s market is far and away the biggest in the world and where they are real leaders in electric vehicles, and more broadly, they are leaders in solar cells, in many aspects of the Green Revolution more broadly — China’s lead might actually grow. So it’s going to be a very complicated pattern, but I do think it is plausible if people play their hand right that the desire of our companies to diversify their source of production and to resist being swallowed by China will lead to greater diversification of the location of production across Asia and a little bit — but I suspect less — bringing back production in certain areas home, back to our homes. But it’s going to be a complicated process, and I think it’s incredibly important to stress that, at least for the foreseeable future, removing China altogether, given the immense efficiency of its productive systems, the concentration and agglomeration of skills in particular areas — removing China altogether just seems, to me, wildly infeasible.

rogé karma

Well, that, in a lot of ways, brings us to the second big shift that you talk about, which is deglobalization. So you’ve been starting to get at it here already, but first, how has globalization shaped the world economy over the past, say, 40 years? And then also, how is that beginning to change now?

martin wolf

Well, this is a very big and complicated story, so let’s look at it in the big picture. I think it’s first very important to understand that globalization is not just trade and certainly not just trade in goods. It includes trade in services. It includes flows of capital, foreign direct investment, portfolio capital, the integration of capital markets. It’s flows of ideas. It’s flows of people. It is the creation of sets of institutions which are, to some extent, global ones. The World Trade Organization is a feature of this. So it’s a very complicated process, and that makes it rather difficult to discuss simply. So it’s very important to understand some of these things could change radically, and others could endure. And my core belief is that, given modern technology, the way we can spread information around the world, however hard we try to control it, that the complete end of our, as it were, global self-awareness, the awareness that we are sharing economic systems and, indeed, the planet will continue, in many ways, to grow, and the environmental crisis is one aspect of that. I think it’s very important. If I focus more narrowly on trade and the related investments, I think the things we can say are something like this. First of all, if you use standard measures, ratios of trade to world G.D.P., the proportion of a value added in a product which comes from many different countries because the components and the assembly are all in different places, in all those sorts of dimensions and perhaps even more important, certainly as important, the extent to which companies became transnational, genuinely organized their production systems across borders — in all those respects, what happened between, let’s say, 1980 and 2010 or so — 2008 to ‘10 — is completely unprecedented in world history. We became more integrated on all those dimensions by a really very large factor than it ever happened before. China was a big part of that, but it wasn’t the only part of that. Essentially, the system that the West had created for itself, particularly, say, in Europe, in the postwar period went global. And what we can say now is if we look at it in terms of policy and in terms of actual flows of trade and capital, that ceased to be dynamic. It ceased to grow faster than the world economy about 15 years ago. And since then, we haven’t had a huge reversal on the evidence, but it hasn’t continued to grow. So as it were, we’ve passed peak globalization in all those dimensions. There are other aspects. Give you the most obvious one — data flows. Data flows are absolutely exploding across borders just as they are within our countries. So it’s a very complicated picture, but in the big picture, globalization hasn’t continued. It hasn’t reversed, at least not in a dramatic way, but politics are now against it. And I’m not at all sure that will reduce trade. It will shift it around. It becomes more politicized. The liberalization process that was dominant for some decades has clearly halted and — most of the evidence suggests — is now somewhat reversing. We’re becoming more regional, and we’re becoming more suspicious of trade with countries we deem potential adversaries. That’s a very important development. How far that will go towards reversing the globalization process, we don’t know, but we’re seeing that.

rogé karma

I really appreciate that answer because I think there’s been a narrative over the past few years that what we’re witnessing is sort of the cracking up of globalization, and that’s not really what you see in the data, right?

martin wolf

Yeah.

rogé karma

Trade and capital flows, while, as you said, as a percentage of world G.D.P. tended to peak around 2008, they’ve generally in absolute terms been increasing over the past few decades. And then Covid was a setback, and everyone sort of thought this was a big setback moment for globalization. But by 2021, global trade had recovered to past prepandemic levels. And then global flows dipped again in the wake of Russia’s invasion, but overall trade actually increased in 2022. And that’s even true in areas where there’s been the most talk of deglobalization, right? The dollar value of trade between the U.S. and China set a new record last year.

martin wolf

Yes, absolutely.

rogé karma

Oil and gas markets have basically completely adjusted to Russia’s invasion. And so I think one view of this is that when you look at the data, it looks like the story of the last few years isn’t one of globalization’s downfall but globalization’s resilience. But on the other hand, I think what you’re getting at in the end of that answer when you talk about geopolitics is what I’ve recently come to think about as the paradox of this moment in deglobalization or globalization. And this is a point made in a recent paper by Pinelopi Goldberg at Yale and Tristan Reed at the World Bank that I found really helpful. What they argue is, yes, when you look at the data, globalization looks fine, but the argument they make is that the data on trade flows in particular is actually a lagging indicator. Trade is downstream from trade policy. Policy is downstream from political sentiment. And when you look at the policies being made right now, when you look at the way that political rhetoric around being tough on China and onshoring industry — it seems like we’re clearly moving in the direction of deglobalization. And their argument is, eventually, it could really show up in the data in a significant way, but that data is just a lagging indicator. And so I’m wondering what you think about that theory.

martin wolf

I think that’s perfectly plausible. As with all turning points in world history, including world economic history, it’s very difficult during those moments to identify what’s going to happen, at least unless you have the start of World War I, in which case things are pretty dramatic, very, very, very quickly. So if the, for example, actual hostilities between the U.S. and China over Taiwan, God forbid, then things could change very rapidly because I think we’d move quite rapidly into something like a global blockade, and the impact of that is sort of unthinkable. It’s certainly gigantic. It would be a transformational moment, as the Great Depression was in the ‘30s and, of course, World War II. So I think this is very perceptive. But I would like to introduce another nuance, which is, I think, very, very important. The U.S. debate on trade is sui generis because the U.S. is sui generis, and I think it’s important, particularly if we’re talking to Americans, for them to understand — this point I made often — is that things like this don’t look the same elsewhere. And there are two or three aspects of this which are crucial. First, the U.S. sort of thinks — and it’s the only economy that can think like this at all — that it is possible and possibly even desirable to be close to self-sufficient. The United States became the biggest economy in the world largely as a self-sufficient country with a very small amount of trade and highly protectionist trade policies in the 19th and early 20th centuries. When it liberalized trade, it did it in large measure — not entirely — because it wanted to promote the development of its allies, particularly in Europe, and it was perfectly prepared to open its markets to help them as long as it didn’t disrupt its own economy too much. And that worked out quite well. So it created a global order, which it sort of assumed wouldn’t be too dramatic in its effects upon itself, and the similar attitude continued, since this worked quite well, through the ‘80s and ‘90s while China was blowing up, blowing up in the sense of becoming such a gigantic player. But more recently, it’s pretty obvious that the Americans have suddenly said to themselves something that everybody else knew, took for granted. My god, this trade stuff is changing our economy dramatically. We’re losing lots of jobs. We’re being forced to specialize in areas we’re good at, and we’re losing labor-intensive manufacturers. We don’t like this. Why don’t we go back to being self-sufficient? And in addition, we expect to be a completely secure superpower. We don’t depend on crucial imports from other countries. We can basically make everything ourselves. And because of its resources and scale, that’s not a completely ludicrous proposition for Americans. But if you look at any other country in the world or even Europe as a whole, we can’t be self-sufficient. We’re always going to be huge net importers of commodities, as China is. Our markets aren’t large enough and our technologies are not in aggregate advanced enough to be self-sufficient in all the products we need, and that’s even truer of the smaller countries within them, let alone all the countries around the world. In other words, all the prosperous countries in the world today other than, perhaps, the United States know that their standard of living depends on sustained, enormous trade with one another. Some of it’s regional within Europe, and some of it’s global. I won’t go into the individual countries. So they look on this as a de-risking process in the genuine sense. Yes, there are some risks, and they want to manage it. They want to maintain crucial technological strengths. Germany is very concerned about that. Japan is concerned about that. But there is no debate that I can see, not really, anywhere about actually ending globalization, reversing the great process of integration of the last 50 or 60 years because they know it’s completely and utterly infeasible. And so the nature of the debate, the rhetoric about this is, in a very profound way, different from the U.S. And all the Asian countries I mentioned — India has a little bit of this dream of self-sufficiency, though I think it’s absurd. And this means — I’m not trying to say that the U.S. isn’t crucial. Of course, it is. But it means that what might actually happen are very different from what Americans might envisage or imagine or conceive of from their own debate. It’s just not the same debate elsewhere.

rogé karma

I think that’s a really important point about the uniqueness of America here. But also, I think it’s important to point out that there are also, I think, some really key debates within America and within the American conversation. And something that I’ve noticed when we’re talking about how the U.S. views the future of globalization is that there are really two major critiques of globalization here that I think are often conflated but lead to very different policy prescriptions. So one is what you can think of as sort of the China shock argument, which, as the now-famous paper by David Autor and colleagues showed, was that globalization and the sort of outsourcing of jobs to China led to a pretty significant loss of manufacturing jobs in a lot of Midwestern factory towns in the U.S. that many believe helped fuel the rise of Donald Trump. And then the second argument is what you can think of as the China entanglement argument, which is that the U.S. economy is now deeply entangled with and dependent on the economy of a country that is increasingly authoritarian and hostile, which makes us really vulnerable if China decides to weaponize certain chokepoints in the global economy, like Russia recently did with energy. And often, in the U.S., I think these two different critiques are made together, but often in practice, they can lead to very different policy directions. So to take one example, one of the big questions in the U.S. right now is what to do about critical minerals, because if you want to manufacture, say, electric vehicle batteries, which the U.S. wants to do a whole lot of, you need a bunch of lithium and cobalt and nickel, and the same is true with different minerals for a whole lot of clean energy technologies, including solar and wind. And right now, a huge percentage of critical minerals are processed by China, and so there’s this question of how we want to go about getting those minerals here. And the Inflation Reduction Act was pretty clear about this. It said that for an E.V. to be eligible for one of the major tax credits in the bill, it needed to be made with a certain percentage of critical minerals processed in the U.S. or one of the handful of countries that the U.S. has a free trade agreement with, and the intention there was to onshore a lot of the critical minerals processing back here to America. But something the Biden administration has been doing as a way to work around the law is to create these new so-called critical minerals agreements with certain allies like Japan and Europe so that EVs with minerals sourced from those countries can qualify for the tax credit. Now, that is very nerdy and in the weeds, I know, but this is where the divide in the U.S. comes in, because if your main worry is about the U.S. being too entangled with China, then you are clearly going to favor those kinds of agreements because they help you to untangle from China quickly. But if your main worry is about creating more domestic blue-collar jobs, then those agreements look terrible because we should be mining and processing those materials right here in the U.S. with U.S. labor, and you sort of see this divide within the Democratic Party right now. The Biden administration signed one of these agreements with Japan earlier this year, and it got attacked by a bunch of high-ranking Senate Democrats and not just the usual suspects like Joe Manchin but folks like Richard Neal, like Ron Wyden, who are usually pretty staunch administration allies and who hold really key positions. And so it really does seem like even within the U.S., there’s multiple different critiques of globalization, one, sort of, that leads you towards more of this onshoring, “we need to do it all alone” approach and one that’s much more in favor of a friendshoring, “let’s together try to disentangle from China” approach, and it seems those really lead in different directions. And so I guess I’m wondering if that’s something you’ve seen as well and more broadly how you understand some of these different cleavages or divides within the deglobalization conversation.

martin wolf

I think that that’s a perceptive and important distinction. Obviously, if you look at the recent discussions in the United States and the way these issues were handled in these very significant speeches by Janet Yellen, secretary of the Treasury, and then Jake Sullivan, national security adviser, they are trying to converge on a view which is more, as it were, in the latter camp, as you defined it. Yes, they talk about a foreign policy — or Sullivan talks about a foreign policy for the middle class, which brings these dilemmas right into the open, obviously. But it looks as though the insistence that we’re not decoupling, we’re de-risking, is more security oriented than it is jobs oriented, and therefore, I can understand, from the point of view of those Democrats who are really concerned about the latter, it doesn’t look as though where the core of the administration is landing is where they want them to land. But I think there’s also an analytical aspect of this. Obviously, these are very different issues, as you’ve implied, which means that trade policy gets very complicated when you have all those different concerns. I mean, my own view is that there is obviously real issues about generating employment and good employment in America, but the China shock is ancient history. If you look at the data, basically, it happened in roughly the first decade of this century, and since then, actually, the share of manufacturing in total employment in the U.S. has been remarkably stable. And there’s been no repeat of this extraordinary shift. Trying to bring back all the industries that went, then, is, I think, going to be very costly and mostly very unproductive, and in other countries, I don’t think many of us really think that we can bring back the sorts of industries that were lost to China at that stage. The reason this is such a huge issue in America is that America failed so completely to generate place-based adjustment policies that allowed crucial parts of your economy and particularly places in your country to adjust to these shocks, and that’s a much broader policy error than just a trade policy error. But we do get absolutely clearly into two fundamental longer-run issues, which we can see. The one is obviously of huge concern to Americans, which is, can we avoid losing our technological leadership to China? My view is the main issues there will be the nature of domestic policy, the ability to sustain innovation and make sure that innovation and innovation hubs continue to be dynamic, because I think the U.S. clearly has the best systems in the world. It should be more confident about that. And the second aspect is, of course, straight national security things, which is, can we produce the things that are actually essential for our capacity to fight wars if we have to fight them, God forbid? And there’s the economic security. We don’t want countries to be able to turn off the taps, and that’s why we want to diversify. We want to diversify production to friendly places, but that doesn’t lead you necessarily to producing at home. It isn’t the case that if everybody produced their own protective equipment at the beginning of Covid, we would all be more secure. The probability is we would have ended up in that situation with chronically inadequate domestic supply. It would have been just as bad. So we have to be very subtle in the way we think about economic and national security in the policies we frame. There’s one final element, which is, how does this all look to China? The U.S. thinks it’s very vulnerable. The Chinese know they’re vulnerable. They feel very vulnerable to embargoes of all kinds. I think that reciprocal vulnerability, the Chinese awareness that they need trade, that they need investment, that they need technology, is actually a stabilizing force in the world. It means that there will be very strong voices in China arguing against a hostile policy because the interests in favor of avoiding that are so great. If we really cut China off, quite apart from the huge economic threats, costs to us — and they will be sizable — it’s inevitable the Chinese will then feel they have nothing to lose by hostility because we’ve cut off all the gains. So we have to be very, very careful about this policy of trying to reduce China’s capacities against us and reduce our dependence on China because it means it also reduces China’s dependence on us, which I think has significant strategic value. And I do think, again, that the recent visits by Secretary Blinken and Secretary Yellen to China indicates that these nuances are understood in the administration. I understand fully why congresspeople might take a different view because they still remember and they represent places which have been hit by Chinese competition, but I think focusing on that and trying to pursue a policy designed to reverse that is very likely to prove a costly failure.

So I’m glad you mentioned the Jake Sullivan and Janet Yellen speeches, because we’ve been talking a lot about these big structural shifts in the global economy — the rise of China, deglobalization. We haven’t got to talk explicitly about your third big shift, climate change, but for those who want to understand more about the policy response to that, we just did a great episode on the Inflation Reduction Act with Rob Meyer that we can link in the show notes. And it’s very clear that these shifts have really been top of mind for the Biden administration. So the speech you alluded to — in April, Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, gave a speech outlining what he called a foreign policy for the middle class that I felt was the sort of clearest articulation of the Biden administration’s thinking to date, and I really think of it in sort of two separate parts. I’ll do my best to summarize it here. One is the diagnosis, which is that the era of unfettered globalization and free markets was a failure on multiple fronts. Geopolitically, it enabled the rise of an authoritarian China and empowered a rogue Russia. Economically, it created a disastrous climate, fragile supply chains, skyrocketing inequality. Politically, it made the U.S. vulnerable to the rise of populists like Donald Trump. And then the second part of the speech is really the prescription, which is more or less that industrial policy, the kinds of policies like the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS Act — that these kinds of policies can help address all of these different pillars at once — that with these bills, we can simultaneously decarbonize the U.S. economy, become less dependent on China and Russia, and deliver a more equal economy all at the same time. And the reason I make that distinction is because you just wrote this really great book, “The Crisis of Democratic Capitalism,” where I think you share a lot of the Biden administration’s core diagnosis, especially this part about economic forces making the U.S. political system vulnerable to a politician like Donald Trump. But in your recent columns, you’ve been a little bit more critical of the Biden administration’s proposed solutions to that problem. So I’d just love to hear from you. I know you got at it a little bit already, but what does this vision, this policy vision of the Biden administration, get right, and what parts of it are you more worried or skeptical of?

martin wolf

So this is obviously a central question. My view is that their analysis, broadly defined, of what’s gone wrong in America and the political consequences of the erosion of the sense of security of what you would call the middle class and their sense of vulnerability and insecurity, which is reinforced in complex ways by cultural changes, has been a very important economic and political process, which has led, among other things, to their attraction for a classic authoritarian demagogue in Donald Trump. And that’s very, very frightening. It has world significance. Obviously, it has significance for the U.S. And they’re entirely right in recognizing that and wanting to do something about it. So the question is, beyond the rhetoric, are they broadly on the right lines with what they are proposing? And I think there are probably two ways of thinking about that, which indicate why I’m a bit skeptical. The general approach of economists — and I plead guilty to this — is that if you’ve got all these different objectives, you want to make your economy more secure. You want to get more jobs for the middle class, the working class, as you define it. You want to improve national security. You want to promote decarbonization of your economy. You want to do something that really reduces carbon emissions. You would say, well, you will need multiple instruments of policy, very distinct instruments of policy, to achieve those objectives because that’s the basic rule of thinking about policy. You need at least one instrument for every objective, and sometimes, you need more than one. So I think that they are expecting too much from what is essentially an industrial policy. It is a multifaceted industrial policy, but nonetheless, I think they’re expecting too much. In particular, I think they won’t end up by generating anything like the scale of permanent employment they hope for. They will not, I think, generate genuinely globally competitive industries to the extent that they want from this. A lot of them will need subsidies indefinitely, and most importantly, the amount of resources, money that is going into this is just not big enough fundamentally to reshape the economy. Where it might work is improving national security in a few areas, which seem to me quite important. I do understand, for example, why the U.S. does feel very vulnerable in its dependence on imports for semiconductors, which are truly essential products and are produced in very few places in the world. And similarly, I can see the concern about — though I’m less worried about this — the dependence on Chinese solar panels, but even there, I think the discussion of how you define what your economic and security vulnerabilities are and how you respond to it optimally is rather inadequate, somewhat naïve. So I’m concerned that the policy has great rhetoric. It has a few quite visible totemic activities, but it’s not going to change U.S. emissions very much. It’s not going to change U.S. manufacturing trajectory very much. In the end, it’s not going to change the political environment that much, and a lot of that might be because, really and truly, Congress and therefore the American people aren’t prepared to make the really radical changes that might actually do much about this. So I would consider myself sympathetic with the objectives, understanding the politics of the objectives, but I’m less than confident that we will, 5 or 10 years from now, look back on this set of policies and say, this was truly transformative. And as I pointed out in some of my columns, U.S. has a fairly long history of industrial policy. Some of it has been a magnificent success, but a lot of it has been a pretty bad failure. And once you start on this in the political system the U.S. has, rent-seeking by people trying to get a hold of subsidies can easily lead to massive distortions, in fact, distortions in the economy, which are not so terribly distinct from the rent-seeking we’re already seeing in many of the U.S. economy’s most important sectors. I may be wrong. I hope I’m wrong, but my view is there’s too much expected from what are really overall quite totemic changes.

rogé karma

I think that’s really well put, but to put on my Biden administration hat for a minute — because I have talked to a lot of folks in the administration or who recently served in the administration, and I want to respond how I think they would. And I think the first way they would respond, which is something you alluded to, is that, of course, these bills weren’t perfect, but they were the best that could be done within the constraints of the American political system. The Biden administration had a 50/50 Senate that hinged on one senator in particular, Joe Manchin, in a highly polarized society with a budget reconciliation process that forced everything into one bill. And it had tried to include things like an expanded child tax credit, care agenda, and that just didn’t work. The only way you could get enough political support was to go with this more industrial policy approach. But I think the second thing they would say is, look, we don’t know if these industrial policy bets are going to pay off, but when you look at what’s been happening already, it seems like they’re already working and not only working but surpassing basically everyone’s expectations. So according to the administration’s estimates, more than $500 billion in private-sector manufacturing investments have been announced since they took office. Biden himself recently pointed out that while spending on manufacturing, construction only increased 2 percent in the four years of the Trump presidency, it’s increased 100 percent in just the first two years of his presidency. And it seems like every week, there’s a new battery-making plant or chip fab or solar project being announced. So I think part of the case they would make is, look, it’s working. And then you look at the projections outward, and I think some of the best, most extensive modeling of this has been done by the Princeton-led REPEAT Project. They’re looking at the modeling of the jobs that Biden’s legislation could create, and they’re specifically looking at the Inflation Reduction Act and the bipartisan infrastructure bill. And under their middle-of-the-road scenario, they estimate that the combination of just those two bills alone will create around 1.5 million additional jobs by 2030 and 2.5 million by 2035. And you mentioned you’re not sure how many of these jobs will be permanent, but of those 2.5 million jobs created by 2035, just over 600,000 are in construction. The rest are in other areas like manufacturing that will continue past the construction phase. And then lastly, I think a point they’ve made to me is that it is truly important to build up a domestic manufacturing base not just because of the jobs it could create or the dependency on China in particular but also because it’s important to have the kind of flexibility to adapt to the challenges of tomorrow. And I think China here is ironically the go-to example, right? When Covid hits, China is quickly able to manufacture a ton of P.P.E. that it is then exporting while the rest of the world struggles with shortages, and the reason is because it has these deep reservoirs of experience and know-how and infrastructure needed to manufacture at scale. And when you talk to folks in the Biden administration, they talk about wanting to build that same capacity here not just because it will help with the industries of today but because we live in an uncertain world. And in an uncertain world, we don’t know what challenges we’re going to face next, and it’s important to have that sort of core industrial capability right here at home. And so I know that was a lot. It’s political constraints. It’s the fact that the I.R.A. and these bills are already working. It’s the need for a domestic manufacturing base. But I’m just wondering how you think about those arguments from me as the quasi representative of the Biden administration here.

martin wolf

Well, let’s respond in turn. On the first one, I am really sympathetic to the argument, and that’s one of the reasons why, unlike many of my friends — and I’ve been criticized by some of my friends on this, and you probably would guess who some of them are — I have been more open to the view that this is worth trying. And it’s worth trying because I think something had to be done politically. I’ll come to the economics in a moment. And as you rightly say, given the nature of American politics in general and specifically today, this was probably the best that could be done, and I accept that. So it’s conceivable that if I’d been asked by anybody in the Biden administration what they should do and they told me this is all they could get through, I would have said, OK, of course, go for it. So that seems to me perfectly reasonable. The second is — and Paul Krugman, whom I admire and respect, has made this point particularly forcefully — it does seem that these programs have led to more investment than most people expected. And that is important, and it might last. And I’m just putting the qualifications because we really don’t know how this is going to end up and whether viable industries will be produced. And you put forward, in fact — and this is where the buck comes in — some figures on gross jobs that might be generated. Now, we know that a lot of these jobs will go to people who are already employed, and many of those people will be people who are already employed in manufacturing. So how much of it will be a net capacity increase in manufacturing is, I think, at least not clear to me. The third element, which I think is probably true — and it comes back to our earlier discussion about the desire for a pretty large amount of self-sufficiency — is that to be a strong economy, one needs a strong, flexible and resilient manufacturing sector. And that’s certainly how everybody thought about this from the middle of the 19th century on until relatively recently. How far this is true in current circumstances, how far it is true that you can move people who have skills and capacities in one area to the ability to produce effectively in another area that is particularly sensitive for you is not clear to me. You pointed out that the Chinese could produce more protective equipment quickly than anyone else could, but of course, they did actually export a lot of this. It was available. How much the U.S. should have invested in the capacity to produce something that they thought most of the time they were not going to need, I think, is at least an open question. The overall economic benefits of focusing on the revitalization of manufacturing in a very highly advanced, high-wage economy like the United States is something that one just has to be a little skeptical about, and I think that there could still be substantial disappointment in this. But I do reckon — and this is the final point — the U.S. is the only economy in the West that can plausibly have a go at this. And it might be — because of the scale of the economy and therefore the economies of scale that can be generated within it, it might turn out that quite a few of these industries are reasonably viable, and they give, therefore, correspondingly reasonable degrees of increased security. I can understand those sorts of arguments. But the real test will be how costly this is going to be, how much of it will generate truly competitive industries in the long run. Is the electric vehicle industry going to end up as an American industry fully competitive with the Chinese industry or not? These are pretty fundamental questions, and the only test there is the test of time. [MUSIC PLAYING]

So we’ve been talking a lot about these bigger shifts in the global economy and how the Biden administration is responding to them, but there are plenty of more immediate crises that the administration is responding to as well. So I want to pull in the second half of your framework here. Tell me about the shocks and fragilities facing the global economy.

martin wolf

Well, the shocks that we’ve been going through — I’m going to put aside the global financial crisis, though, actually, I think we’re very much been living in its shadow. It’s not gone. But the shocks that matter obviously were the pandemic, then the impact of the recovery from the pandemic with the pandemic itself on global supply chains and the disruptions caused there, and then, in my view, largely as a result of these two things together, the sudden and completely unexpected rise in inflation. Suddenly, we were having inflation in the way we hadn’t seen for 40 years, and it was linked, of course, to an energy shock, partly before the Russian invasion of Ukraine but reinforced by it. So it had inevitably, for someone like myself, echoes of the ‘70s and early ‘80s. And that has led, of course, to something really important, which was a big rise in interest rates. I noticed that many economists think that the Fed has now finished its tightening of monetary policy, but it’s quite a tightening. And it’s been quite sudden. And of course, this then links to the fragilities, because the most important fragility in the economic space, as it were, which is global and national in the U.S. case — we have extraordinarily highly indebted economies. It’s particularly true in the U.S. for government debt, which is very high levels by historical standards — that’s overt government debt — very high levels and, of course, debt in the non-financial corporate sector. The financial sector’s leverage and the household sector’s leverage is less of a problem. If we look at the world as a whole — and we talked about China, but that’s true almost everywhere — we have the most highly leveraged economy as far as we can see from the data, which are limited, that we’ve ever had. And the general rule for economists is if you’ve got lots and lots of debt around and it gets much more expensive — and it is — that you’re likely to see financial shocks, financial crises. And we’ve seen some of those, and we could well see more of them. This then all interacts of course with other fragilities, which the most important are political, but those are the shocks which are now interacting with one of our most important fragilities, creating a real question about what the next 5, 10 years will be like. A crucial element here is how quickly does the legacy of the shocks dissipate, and here, I think, recent evidence might make one a bit more confident about the path of inflation. That suggests one might be more confident about the future of interest rates, in which case we may be OK. But right now, we don’t know.

rogé karma

Let’s talk about the inflation picture then and interest rates because this is one area where the nature of the shock has really changed in recent months. So we’re recording this in late July, and according to the June C.P.I. report, headline inflation has come down from around 9 percent at its peak last year to around 3 percent. Basically, every other indicator — even though stripping out things like energy and food and rent are down as well. And meanwhile, unemployment in the U.S. has remained below 4 percent, which is something that most economists really didn’t think could happen. Six months or a year ago, the story was that a recession was inevitable if you wanted to bring inflation down, and that just hasn’t been the case so far. So give me your read of the current inflation story. What’s happening, and where do you think it goes next?

martin wolf

I think that’s really important, and I think an honest statement from me — and so often, including this discussion — is I don’t know. But my perspective has been that I got something importantly right and I got something importantly wrong, and the question is where this plays out. I was one of the people who was concerned about the inflationary consequences of the pandemic quite early. I thought that the huge expansion of fiscal deficits combined with the huge monetary expansion of the 2020 and the continuation of that in 2021 created very severe inflation risks, and so I was relatively hawkish on this in 2020 and ‘21. And that proved to be correct. And I argued this wasn’t going to be temporary in the sense that the Fed could just ignore it, so I supported the tightening policy. And I think it was broadly correct. Now, I was one of the people who thought that once inflation began to be entrenched, particularly in labor markets — and you were seeing it in wages and earnings across much of the Western world — that it would be very difficult to disinflate smoothly without a rise in unemployment, and there were a number of others who took very similar views. And right now, it’s beginning to look as though that was too pessimistic. I think there is one quite interesting reason why that might be wrong, and that is that, actually, unemployment is not a good measure of labor slack and that in particular, there is, as I understand it, a reduction in hours worked in some economies. I’m not sure how much in the U.S., but certainly elsewhere. And that’s, of course, also an indication of labor slack. And of course, there’s a reduction in vacancies, and that is also an indication of labor slack. And it may be that now, with our very much more competitive labor markets than 50 years ago and much more flexible labor markets, a reduction in vacancies and perhaps, to some extent, hours is itself enough of a loosening of the labor market, a reduction in excess demand, that all of its own — it will eliminate or vastly reduce the pressure on wages and so might the reduction in headline inflation, even though it’s not a reduction in 2 percent levels, the target levels of core inflation. So at this sense, I think —

rogé karma

Can I just jump in there just to clarify, just to make sure? Because I think this is a really important point. So what you’re saying is that one reason why we might not have seen sort of unemployment have to rise for inflation to come down is because when you look at typical models of the core drivers of inflation, a huge one is wages. And so the belief is that as long as labor markets remain tight — and usually, employment is a measure of the tightness of labor markets — wages will keep pushing up, and so inflation will keep pushing up. And the typical way to solve that is that the Fed raises interest rates, which causes unemployment to rise, and things cool off. But what you’re saying is that actually what we’re seeing is that the labor market seems to be cooling off without unemployment rising because there are these other sort of metrics, like hiring is back to prepandemic levels. Vacancies are down. Workers aren’t quitting as frequently. And so what we’re seeing and what economists might have not expected is that wage growth itself is starting to slow down. The labor market is starting to cool, but it didn’t require a big spike in unemployment to do that. I just wanted to make sure that I’m clear on that.

martin wolf

Yes, and that is an argument that one of the Fed governors — if I think, it was Governor Waller — made and I was rather skeptical about it. But it looks more plausible now or at least less implausible. And let’s be very clear. I would be very, very happy if that turned out to be the case, that we can eliminate the danger of a sort of wage-price spiral without actually raising employment significantly. It will mean, of course, that for many workers, their real wages will have declined, which is not a good thing, because, after all, there has been now an extended period of high inflation and that — we’re not expecting negative inflation. So the price level will be higher, and wages won’t have fully caught up. And of course, as the Bank for International Settlements recently pointed out, the last mile might be the most difficult because we haven’t got back to core inflation of 2 percent yet, and that’s presumably the target. And it might turn out that, actually, we’re not going to be there so easily. So I’m somewhat agnostic about the future. I think it’s still quite possible that getting core inflation back to 2 percent, which I think is the right objective — we can discuss that separately — in the circumstances, though there’s a lot to be said on that — that getting there will still require a slowdown which shows itself up in open unemployment. But it now looks to me at least more plausible than I thought a year or so ago that the disinflation process can be carried out without any significant rise in unemployment, and that would seem to me wonderful. And it shows that the labor market and the economy, which is not surprising in a way, doesn’t operate now in the way it did half a century ago and in a way that is rather cheerful. And if that’s the case, it’s quite plausible that the Fed has reached peak interest rates now, and in the next year, interest rates will start coming down. And things will look better.

rogé karma

So I take your point that getting from 3 percent or 4 percent down to 2 percent inflation could be much harder and more painful than getting to this point and that core inflation should be the right measure of that. But I think there are a few responses you’ll hear from some of the more dovish economists to that argument, and I want to hear what you think of them. So the first one is that core inflation actually isn’t the right indicator because a huge component of core inflation — and just for people, core inflation is inflation excluding certain volatile prices like energy and food. But a huge component of core inflation, about 40 percent, actually, is shelter. It’s rents. And the price of rents has a well-known lag in the data of about a year because most people have one-year leases. And so the current rent prices baked into the core inflation measure are still reflecting the housing market of a year before and, in this case, the housing market of mid 2022. And we just know from a lot of different sources that rents have been falling for some time now, even if that hasn’t been reflected in the numbers. And so I think the first response you’ll get from economists is, look, when you look at core inflation, it’s sort of artificially high, but if you look at something like super core, which also strips out rent, it’s much lower. So that’s sort of the first argument, is like, maybe core inflation isn’t the right measure. But then the second and, I think, more important response is, why are we even shooting for 2 percent in the first place, especially if that might require really bringing the hammer down on the labor market? So when I look at the current economy, G.D.P. growth is the highest in the G7 in the U.S. right now. Labor force participation for prime-age workers is the highest it’s been in decades. Real wages are on the rise for the first time since March 2021, which means that even with inflation at its current levels, workers across the board are coming out ahead. We mentioned earlier the low unemployment rate. And so in many ways, this feels like exactly the kind of pro-worker, fast-growing economy that we’ve been hoping for, really, ever since 2008. And so it feels strange to say that we’re going to bring the hammer down, and we’re going to throw people out of work. We’re going to possibly risk another banking crisis just to get inflation down from 4 percent or 3 percent down to 2 percent. The 2 percent target itself is a pretty arbitrary one anyways. And so I’m wondering how you think about both of those points, both the core inflation point and then also the, is it even worth trying to get down 2 percent if it’s going to require some pain?

martin wolf

So excellent points and excellent questions, and I think I would divide my responses into the time horizon and the target. They’re very different. So the crucial point — as I think our earlier discussion shows, there’s huge uncertainty about what’s going to happen, and you’ve indicated some of the aspects of that. I think that the Fed has already done a very substantial tightening, and I would not — I think I probably wouldn’t have supported the last rise. And it would be perfectly sensible for the Fed to say, given the lags in monetary policy, that we’ve already done a sizable tightening in response to this unexpected surge in inflation. That may well be one of the reasons why inflation is slowing, that people are aware that we’re not going to accommodate anything, but there’s no reason whatsoever to tighten further. Given the lags, we’ll see what happens. And if these arguments about shelter are correct, we’ll begin to see over the next six months to a year a very appreciable slowdown in core inflation, and we don’t need to act given that tightening we’ve got in the bank already preemptively against bring down the hammer as you put it any more than we’ve done. Maybe we’ve even done too much. We’re going to watch and see. And I think that would have been and would be a perfectly sensible policy. And if it becomes obvious that core inflation is indeed, for the reasons you suggest, beginning to fall rapidly towards our target and we finally hit it a year or a year and a half or even two years from now, that’s not a big problem. And as soon as it’s obvious that’s happening, we’re going to start loosening and probably quite aggressively. I think that would be a perfectly reasonable approach for the Fed to take. The time horizon combined with the uncertainty would suggest to me, and given the arguments you made, that the right thing to do now possibly to have done is nothing and just see what happens. Then there’s the question of what the objective is. Now, I think that targets are, to some extent, arbitrary. And whether it’s 2 percent or 2.5 percent really doesn’t excite me very much, and I wouldn’t worry if it ended up at 2.5 percent. And there is an argument to be made that maybe inflation should be a bit higher. I won’t go into that argument now because it’s complicated, but one could make it. I think there are two considerations, nonetheless, that the Fed does and, I think, should bear in mind in deciding this. First, if the Fed decides to change its target significantly just because it’s difficult after an unexpected period of inflation to get back down to it, it is going to undermine ineluctably the credibility of any target. And I think one of the great benefits of where we’ve been and one of the reasons we got through this crisis without a huge spike in underlying core inflation, including wages, is actually very clear from the figures that the credibility of inflation expectations in the medium to long run has not been undermined. And so the Fed risks undermining its long-term effectiveness by being showing itself willing to change the target, not the timing of getting back to the target but the target itself, just because it gets a bit difficult. So that’s the one reason. The second is, if it creeps up, you start getting to a situation in which inflation is high enough that people start thinking about it all the time. One of the reasons for 2 percent is — and Alan Greenspan said this a long time ago, and I happened to agree with this point, which is — the important thing we want to do is have a rate of inflation at which basically nobody really thinks about inflation. It’s just something that — it’s not part of decision making. It’s not part of wage setting . It just goes away. So for those two reasons, provided you don’t overdo it now — that’s very important. There’s no reason they have to get back to 2 percent six months from now. But a year or two, I would say that it would be damaging and risky to give up precisely when it looks as though they might be actually able to get back to target without huge costs, and that’s just the sort of circumstances in which the right thing to do is, as I say, do nothing and watch.

rogé karma

So I want to end by zooming back out to the big picture. When you look at all of these shifts, these shocks, these fragilities taken together, where does it leave you? What are the different potential trajectories you see for the global economy moving forward?

martin wolf

Well, I think there’s a dominant possibility — I want to be optimistic. So we’ve had three massive shocks, and that’s really extraordinary. We’ve had them in a very short period. Well, why not assume that we’re just unlucky in the draw, and we’re not going to have further such shocks, and we’re going to get back to something like normal? The people will realize that fighting a war with China is insane. People will start focusing on de-risking a bit but not actually decoupling. I think that’s already beginning to happen. Business as usual will continue. We’ll have quite strong economies with high employment across the world. We will manage the energy problem. We will generate more growth with the energy transition, and we will maybe — I think it’s actually the more likely chance that over the next 10 years or so, we’ll have a good period, and we will preserve a lot of what’s really, really good about globalization and maybe lose some of it. There will be many big problems, and I think the climate transition is the biggest. But I think there’s a dominant possibility that we’ve survived a period of extraordinary volatility and not that badly, and it will get back to normal. That’s the nicest possibility. The second possibility, of course, is that for political or geopolitical reasons, we have some more really important turbulence, and the thing that has worried me most here is actual war, that it’s not just Russia-Ukraine, which is frightening enough, given that Russia has 5,000 nuclear warheads, but possibly U.S.-China over Taiwan, that geopolitical relations are not managed in a stable way. I think it’s a low probability, but it’s non-zero. And of course, that would be very, very serious. I think that it is possible that the climate situation we’re seeing runs away. We have a runaway climate shift with incalculable consequences much more quickly than we now expect. That would, again, be an economic as well as a social and human disaster. That would clearly make things worse. And of course, we can have political developments within any of our countries — but again, the U.S. is most likely — which will destabilize much more of the world, possibly even the whole Western alliance system, which is an important part of global stability. I don’t regard these as high probabilities. And on the more optimistic side, again, we have technological changes underway, notably in artificial intelligence, which we’re not discussing, that might mean, conceivably, a huge further acceleration in global growth, and these, I think, would be possibly hugely beneficial. So I want to stress that though there are lots of worries and concerns — there were pretty large worries and concerns in 1950, and that turned out to be the beginning of 20 years of extraordinary success for much of the world. And I would also like to stress that this period of globalization everybody is so critical of generated the fastest reductions in poverty worldwide ever, not just in China but across the world. So I remain ultimately — provided we manage our politics in a sensible way, both nationally and globally, I’m actually an optimist, and I want people to feel they should be and can be optimists. We have the capacity to improve our world, and we should take advantage of that capacity and that opportunity.

Well, it seems like no matter what trajectory we end up heading for, we’re going to need lots of wisdom to help us navigate it and hopefully get to those optimistic situations, so let me ask you the question that we always end the podcast with, which is what are three books that have influenced you that you’d recommend to the audience?

martin wolf

Well, I’m going to do something which I think is possibly a bit naughty, but I hope it’s alright. I have, as you know, been focusing very much of my efforts intellectually on what’s happening to our democracies and the policy and the environment within which our democracies are operating, and apart from, obviously, my own work, there are three works which are particularly important in my thinking about, three relatively recent books. Two of them, unfortunately, are co-authored by one person, Daron Acemoglu of MIT, who has, I think, been an enormously significant thinker in the area of political economy. He’s, I think, the leading economist, academic economist, who’s written on political economy. And one of them was really important for me. It’s a book he wrote with Robinson — this is Acemoglu and Robinson — called “The Narrow Corridor,” and it’s about the fragility of democracy and finding that sweet spot between the Leviathan, the excessively authoritarian state, and anarchy on the other. And that’s organized freedom, and I think it’s an absolutely brilliant discussion of that. And the second book he co-authored is the most recent with Simon Johnson, is called “Power and Progress,” and it focuses on something absolutely fundamental, which is, can we shape technology to our own ends? I’m more skeptical than they are, but it’s unbelievably important that we manage to find a way of controlling the technology that we are generating, the energy technology, which we failed to do, and now the computing technology that we are employing so that we are the masters of our technological development, not the slaves. And I think this is such an unbelievably important topic, and it’s one I didn’t focus on. So I think those two books are really important. The last is, to me, a seminal book, which is sort of, in a way, an anti-Acemoglu and Robinson. It was by Robert Gordon. It’s called “The Rise and Fall of American Growth,” and it really explores why there was this huge wave of innovation between 1880 and 1940, roughly 1950, 1960, actually into the ‘60s, and then the decline. And it’s much more pessimistic, and that is very disturbing for the future because if productivity growth slows, I think it becomes much more difficult to sustain our sort of society. Our democracy, I think, was the product of growth, and it depends on it. That’s a controversial view. Anyway, these three books are, I think, pretty important books, and they’re ones I would like people to read. [MUSIC PLAYING]

There’s less plastic pollution flowing into the ocean from land than scientists previously thought, according to a study published Monday in the journal Nature Geoscience.

The researchers estimated that about 500,000 metric tons of plastic end up in the ocean each year, with about half from land. The other half comes from the fishing industry in the form of nets, ropes, buoys and other equipment.

An earlier, widely publicized study in 2015 estimated that about eight million metric tons of plastic were entering the ocean each year from rivers alone. The new research might seem like good news, but the full picture is complicated: The amount of plastic in the ocean is still increasing by about 4 percent every year, according to the study.

Even a small increase each year adds up to a huge accumulation over time. Within 20 years, the amount of plastic on the sea surface could double, the authors found."

Implementing stricter limits on fine particulate matter could reduce mortality rates by up to 7 percent for Black and low-income Americans over 65 who are already exposed to some of the dirtiest air in the United States, according to the study, led by researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

There is already overwhelming evidence that people of color, and Black communities in particular, are disproportionately exposed to harmful air pollutants like the fine particulate matter examined in the study, which is known as PM 2.5 because it is no more than 2.5 micrometers in diameter.

The new research, published Friday in The New England Journal of Medicine, found that tightening the limit on fine particulate matter by 4 micrograms per cubic meter of air would result in a 4 percent reduction in the mortality rate for higher-income white adults. The same change would result in a reduction of 6 percent to 7 percent for higher-income Black adults, lower-income white adults and lower-income Black adults."

At various moments in “Elon Musk,” Walter Isaacson’s new biography of the world’s richest person, the author tries to make sense of the billionaire entrepreneur he has shadowed for two years — sitting in on meetings, getting a peek at emails and texts, engaging in “scores of interviews and late-night conversations.” Musk is a mercurial “man-child,” Isaacson writes, who was bullied relentlessly as a kid in South Africa until he grew big enough to beat up his bullies. Musk talks about having Asperger’s, which makes him “bad at picking up social cues.” As the people closest to him will attest, he lacks empathy — something that Isaacson describes as a “gene” that’s “hard-wired.”

Yet even as Musk struggles to relate to the actual humans around him, his plans for humanity are grand. “A fully reusable rocket is the difference between being a single-planet civilization and being a multiplanet one”: Musk would “maniacally” repeat this message to his staff at SpaceX, his spacecraft and satellite company, where every decision is motivated by his determination to get earthlings to Mars. He pushes employees at his companies — he now runs six, including X, the platform formerly known as Twitter — to slash costs and meet brutal deadlines because he needs to pour resources into the moonshot of colonizing space “before civilization crumbles.” Disaster could come from climate change, from declining birthrates, from artificial intelligence. Isaacson describes Musk stalking the factory floor of Tesla, his electric car company, issuing orders on the fly. “If I don’t make decisions,” Musk explained, “we die.”

By “we,” Musk presumably meant Tesla in that instance. But Musk likes to speak of his business interests in superhero terms, so it’s sometimes hard to be sure. Isaacson, whose previous biographical subjects include Leonardo da Vinci and Steve Jobs, is a patient chronicler of obsession; in the case of Musk, he can occasionally seem too patient — a hazard for any biographer who is given extraordinary access. At one point, Isaacson asks why Musk is so offended by anything he deems politically correct, and Musk, as usual, has to dial it up to 11. “Unless the woke-mind virus, which is fundamentally anti-science, anti-merit and anti-human in general, is stopped,” he declares, “civilization will never become multiplanetary.” There are a number of curious assertions in that sentence, but it would have been nice if Isaacson had pushed him to answer a basic question: What on earth does any of it even mean?

Isaacson has ably conveyed that Musk doesn’t truly like pushback. Some of his lieutenants insist that he will eventually listen to reason, but Isaacson sees firsthand Musk’s habit of deriding as a saboteur or an idiot anyone who resists him. The musician Grimes, the mother of three of Musk’s children (the existence of the third, Techno Mechanicus, nicknamed Tau, has been kept private until now), calls his roiling anger “demon mode” — a mind-set that “causes a lot of chaos.” She also insists that it allows him to get stuff done."

This “prevention through deterrence” framework risks worsening the humanitarian crisis at the border. When those who simply can’t return home for fear of violence or death are prevented from applying for asylum at legal ports of entry, they’re left with little choice but to take dangerous, illegal routes into the United States and walk right into Mr. Abbott’s death trap.

Mr. Biden must change course, and that begins by stopping Mr. Abbott. The president should order the immediate removal of the lethal razor wire and obstructions in the Rio Grande and ensure that Border Patrol are unimpeded by Texas Department of Public Safety officers — today. He must then take prompt action to replace Mr. Abbott’s disregard for human life with leadership that upholds our values as Americans, including by providing better legal pathways for those with valid asylum claims to safely and in an orderly fashion apply for refuge at legal ports of entry instead of desperately crossing dangerous stretches of the river. This is the president’s chance to show Americans that a humane approach is not only the right thing to do but also that it is the best way to establish order and safety at our southern border.

I know that the politics on this aren’t easy. And I can see why it might be tempting to allow the governor to assume ownership over the Texas border rather than pursue a public confrontation on an issue that is this politically charged. But if the president fails to enforce the federal government’s clear supremacy on matters of immigration, he will allow this challenge to grow as both a humanitarian crisis and as a political liability for his administration as he heads into 2024.

Be on the right side of history, demonstrate the kind of strong, decisive leadership that Americans are desperate for, and the politics will follow. After all, when Mr. Biden won his presidential election, he did so in part on the promise to “restore our moral standing in the world and our historic role as a safe haven for refugees and asylum seekers.”

Now is his chance to deliver."

Yet the addition of these requirements is almost certain to drastically complicate negotiations on a final defense bill in Congress, a process that is typically bipartisan. The passage sets up a showdown between the Republican-led House and the Democratic-led Senate that could imperil the $886 billion measure, which would provide a pay raise for troops, set defense policy to counter the U.S.’s adversaries and sustain Pentagon programs at a time of rising threats.

Many Democrats denounced the bill, accusing McCarthy of capitulating to far-right members who were using national security issues as leverage for advancing their ideological positions.

After the murder of George Floyd, according to a survey by The Washington Post, companies like Apple and Pfizer pledged to fight racism, and the nation’s 50 largest public companies and their foundations committed nearly $50 billion to addressing racial inequality.

Little did they know that companies were turning themselves into perfect targets for post-Trump Republicans. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida (a likely presidential candidate) became one of the most visible champions of the strategy after starting a highly public tussle against Disney in 2022 after its chief executive at the time, Bob Chapek, under pressure from his employees, denounced legislation meant to prohibit classroom discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity through the third grade. Brooks Barnes reported in The Times that after months of maneuvering, Mr. DeSantis gained control of the board that oversees development at Walt Disney World, restricting Disney’s autonomy over its theme-park complex. The message was clear: Addressing issues of social justice can come at a cost.

That began to change as growing partisanship made it much harder to avoid staking out positions on issues such as racial justice and climate change. Surveys also showed that the rising generation of young workers and consumers was not only progressive but also more willing to work for and to buy from companies willing to speak out on politically charged issues. In 2015, 379 companies and groups from various industries signed onto a friend-of-the-court brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage. After the murder of George Floyd, according to a survey by The Washington Post, companies like Apple and Pfizer pledged to fight racism, and the nation’s 50 largest public companies and their foundations committed nearly $50 billion to addressing racial inequality.

Little did they know that companies were turning themselves into perfect targets for post-Trump Republicans. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida (a likely presidential candidate) became one of the most visible champions of the strategy after starting a highly public tussle against Disney in 2022 after its chief executive at the time, Bob Chapek, under pressure from his employees, denounced legislation meant to prohibit classroom discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity through the third grade. Brooks Barnes reported in The Times that after months of maneuvering, Mr. DeSantis gained control of the board that oversees development at Walt Disney World, restricting Disney’s autonomy over its theme-park complex. The message was clear: Addressing issues of social justice can come at a cost.

Yellen on Thursday called for a “constructive” and “healthy” economic relationship between the United States and China, one in which the two nations could work together to confront global challenges in spite of their conflicting national security interests.

Ms. Yellen’s comments, which she delivered at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies, were one of the most comprehensive articulations yet by a Biden official of the administration’s stance toward China. The speech struck a pragmatic but notably positive tone following months of heightened tensions between the nations, including over Chinese espionage and influence operations in the United States.

Ms. Yellen stressed the importance of securing American national security interests, as well as of protecting human rights. But she also argued that the United States was secure enough in its leadership of the global economy to welcome economic competition from China, as long as the country played by international rules.

“China’s economic growth need not be incompatible with U.S. economic leadership,” she said, adding, “We do not seek to ‘decouple’ our economy from China’s.”"

It is unclear whether these conservatives are working from the same memo or just have the same narrow obsession. Regardless, there is no evidence that any diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives were responsible for the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. It is nonsense. And while it shouldn’t be taken seriously on its own terms, this deflection is worth noting for what it represents: the relentless effort to mystify real questions of political economy in favor of endless culture war conflict.

The real story behind the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank has much more to do with the political and economic environment of the previous decade than it does with wokeness, a word that signifies nothing other than conservative disdain for anything that seems liberal.

As its name suggests, Silicon Valley Bank was tied tightly into the financial infrastructure of the tech industry. Founded in 1983, it claimed to bank for “nearly half of all U.S. venture-backed start-ups,” and it worked closely with many venture capital firms. It is risky for a bank to take most of its deposits from a single tightly knit industry. But for much of the past decade, low interest rates, easy money and cheap loans meant that this industry was on the upswing. As tech boomed, so did S.V.B.

“Flush with cash from high-flying start-ups,” my newsroom colleague Vivian Giang explained, Silicon Valley Bank “did what most of its rivals do: It kept a small chunk of its deposits in cash and it used the rest to buy long-term debt like Treasury bonds.” As long as interest rates stayed low, those bonds promised safe returns."

The governor is approaching a Saturday deadline to decide on hundreds of bills that the State Legislature sent to his desk last month for approval.

Though many bills remain pending — of the more than 2,600 bills introduced this legislative session, the most in a decade, roughly 900 of them made it to Newsom’s desk — the governor has already cast his final vote on some particularly high-profile and closely watched measures.

On Tuesday, the governor signed a bill to make it easier to detain people with mental health and addiction issues and force them into treatment. The new law, which critics say infringes on civil liberties, is part of a broader effort to overhaul the state’s mental health system and address homelessness in California.

Newsom is expected to approve putting an initiative on the March primary election ballot to finance housing for homeless people with mental illness. More than 170,000 people are homeless in California, accounting for about one third of the nation’s homeless population."

In some cases, rebates may affect the size of the federal credit, so consult a tax professional for help calculating your potential benefit, Ms. Walker said.

If you are due for a new roof, it may make sense to replace it before you invest in solar, because it can be expensive to remove and reinstall the panels, Dr. Jones-Albertus said. Some solar contractors also do roofs or work closely with roofing companies, so you may be able to economize by having them done at the same time, she said.

Some solar contractors offer the option to lease the system rather than buy it, but in that case you won’t own it — so you don’t qualify for the tax credit, Ms. Walker said.

Here are some questions and answers about home solar:

How can I find a reliable solar installer?

The Solar Energy Industries Association recommends looking for a contractor certified by a reputable group like the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners. Seek quotes from at least three firms, and preferably five, including local, regional and national operators, Mr. Aggarwal recommended. Ask who will do the work; some use in-house installers, while others hire outside labor. The association offers a guide that walks consumers through the process. Often, the initial assessment can be done remotely, using satellite images of your home.

Like any home-improvement project, solar installations may attract disreputable contractors, said Melanie McGovern, a spokeswoman for the International Association of Better Business Bureaus. A legitimate installer will answer your questions, provide a detailed cost estimate and allow time for you to consider it. Ask for references, and research the company’s reputation online. Move on if the representative pressures you to sign a contract immediately, or says a price is good only for that day, Ms. McGovern said: “That’s a red flag.”"

For sure, the huge costs incurred in minimizing the effects of Covid played a major role in this debt explosion, but the poorest fiscal policy in at least a half-century — courtesy of two presidents, a Republican and a Democrat — played an even bigger part and add to the urgency of addressing this problem.

While President Biden is approaching only the halfway mark in his term, the four-year record of the Republicans — the party that most often lectures the nation about fiscal rectitude — is likely to end up being even worse than that of the Democrats. After the spending spree of the past nearly three years, the appetite for more big unfunded spending packages has fortunately diminished, at least for the moment. The Republicans, conveniently resuming their commitment to fiscal responsibility just as they may be about to take power in Congress, are threatening to leverage a debt crisis to force through spending cuts — all while simultaneously aiming to extend Trump-era tax cuts."

We could not.

Can the courts maintain public faith and deal credibly with a former president running for his old job who has been accused of so many crimes it is hard to keep track? Can Congress get its act together enough to simply pick a leader, much less address vexing issues like immigration, spending, climate change and gun violence?

In September, Eleanor Lutz wrote about NASA’s next human mission:

Since the final Apollo mission in 1972, the moon has been undisturbed by human footsteps. But that may soon change. NASA plans to send astronauts back to the moon this decade in a series of spaceflights called the Artemis program. The first planned launch is a test flight with no crew members aboard. NASA has postponed the flight twice so far, including on Saturday [Sept. 3], because of technical issues during the launch countdown, and will reschedule a third try soon. Eventually, though no earlier than 2025, NASA will send astronauts for a weeklong stay near the moon’s south pole. The crew will include the first woman and the first person of color to walk on the moon, NASA said.

That third try is slated to happen on Wednesday. What is your first impression of this mission? Are you excited by the thought of Americans returning to the moon? Are you skeptical or indifferent? Why?

In “NASA Is Returning to the Moon This Week. Why Do We Feel Conflicted?” Shannon Stirone, a space journalist, hosted a written online conversation with Leroy Chiao, a retired NASA astronaut; Lori Garver, a former deputy administrator of NASA; and David Grinspoon, an astrobiologist, about the big questions surrounding the Artemis launch. Here are some excerpts from their discussion:

Shannon Stirone: How’s everyone feeling about NASA returning to the moon after almost 50 years? Leroy, let’s start with you as the one who has been to space. Leroy Chiao: I’m glad we’re finally going to launch this rocket (hopefully). It has been a long time, and a lot of money. Since I was inspired to become an astronaut by the Apollo moon missions, I would have loved a chance to go to the moon myself. But I have mixed feelings, though I hope that we have a successful mission. It is always exciting to see a new vehicle fly.

Ms. Garver adds:

Lori Garver: Like Leroy and David, I have very mixed feelings. I agree that sending humans to the moon again could offer meaningful benefits to the United States and society as a whole, but I don’t believe the way we are going about it is sustainable because we are using outdated and expensive single-use technologies. Apollo was a race, so doing it in that fashion was the right thing to do. We’ve now spent tens of billions of dollars and over a dozen years doing it again — just saying it is sustainable doesn’t make it so. Stirone: True. We often tout human exploration as a marker of technological progress, but the truth is we don’t need to go back to the moon other than to demonstrate, as we did in the 1960s, that we can. Is human landing on the moon a mark of progress, or does scientific discovery matter more? What do we gain from humans on the moon? Chiao: We have not sent people to the moon since 1972, so we don’t have the capability to do so immediately now. It is a bit of a “do-over,” but we have to relearn these things before we can go on to Mars, another NASA goal. Grinspoon: There’s also a huge wealth of scientific knowledge to be gained by a return to the moon. There are really important, fundamental questions about the history of Earth, the history of life. There are wonderful investigations we can do there.

Mr. Grinspoon points out that, compared with human spaceflight, robotic missions “have always been much more science-driven and more efficient.” Ms. Stirone asks:

Stirone: To your point, the science potential on the moon is incredibly valuable. But shouldn’t we have spent all of the funds for the human mission on robotic science missions instead? Grinspoon: Well, realistically we were never going to get equivalent funds to just do science with robots. Can you imagine if we did? Stirone: I do! All the time. Grinspoon: We could have orbiters around every planet in the solar system for a fraction of the cost of Artemis. But nobody gave us that option. In reality, the main reasons to send humans are other intangibles, some mentioned already, but also for inspiration and the human drive to explore, and reasons that I would even call spiritual. And as a scientist, I have to say, if we are going to go for these other reasons, then let’s be sure and set it up in such a way that we can do some great and important science while we’re there. Garver: Going to and from space is expensive. Lowering the cost of space activities would allow us — whether it’s governments, consortiums, companies, etc. — to do more meaningful things in the domain.

Ms. Stirone continues:

Stirone: Leroy, NASA says: “We’re going back to the moon for scientific discovery, economic benefits, and inspiration for a new generation of explorers: the Artemis Generation.” As someone who has been to space, do you think a crewed mission is required to inspire people to be interested in space exploration? Chiao: It’s a balance. I’m a big supporter of robotic space missions as well as human ones. Humans relate to other humans doing the exploration. We have sent probes into the upper atmosphere, and down to the deepest depths of the oceans, and have made many discoveries. But, when the first humans climbed Everest, and when the first human — fairly recently — went down to the floor of the Mariana Trench, that’s when the public got interested. So, yes, the science is exciting to many, but the human experience is usually exciting to all.

Students, read the entire article, then tell us:

After learning more about the Artemis program and the panelists’ views on it, how do you feel about the mission? Do you think it is critical for “scientific discovery, economic benefits and inspiration for a new generation of explorers” as NASA has said? Or does it seem like a waste of time, money and resources?

The panelists offer several reasons human spaceflight is valuable — among them that it is inspirational to future explorers, that it’s a marker of geopolitical leadership, that it can give us information for a future Mars landing, that it is even a spiritual need. Which of the reasons mentioned in the article are most compelling to you? What else do you think can be gained from sending humans to space?

Several panelists noted that robotic missions were often more science-driven and efficient and less expensive than human missions. Do you think taxpayer money would be better spent on robotic missions, such as, for example, the recent James Webb telescope launch? Or do you think there is value in spending tens of billions of dollars to send humans to space, even if the mission is less science-driven and more expensive?

How valuable do you think space exploration is in general? For example, one panelist brings up climate change. Should the government prioritize solving problems here on Earth? Or is space exploration and scientific discovery just as important? Why?

The Artemis mission plans to include the first woman and first person of color to land on the moon. How important do you think these kinds of firsts are? What would these achievements mean to you?

Ms. Stirone asks the panelists: “What are your biggest space science questions right now?” How would you answer that? What do you want to know about the universe and beyond?

Britain’s National Health Service turns 75 this month. It is in the deepest crisis of its history: flooded by aging patients; starved of investment; and understaffed by doctors and nurses, many of whom are so burned out that they are either joining strikes or leaving for jobs abroad.

Doctors, nurses, patients, hospital administrators and medical analysts described a system so profoundly troubled that some experts warned that the N.H.S. was at risk of collapse. In 2022, the number of excess deaths rose to one of the highest levels in the past 50 years, and those numbers have kept rising, even as Covid has ebbed.

Context: The pandemic exposed a legion of problems that had been incubating within the service since Conservative-led governments began curbing budget increases in 2010, the start of a decade of austerity.

The provocateur Calixto Bieito’s production of Verdi’s “Aida” at Theater Basel over a decade ago has been described as a difficult, even disturbing depiction of immigration in Europe. His new staging, at the Berlin State Opera (Oct. 3-29), is being billed more modestly, as homing in on the work’s intimacy, and as mining the tension between the opera and the politics of its time. Nicola Luisotti conducts a cast that includes the tenor Yusif Eyvazov as Radamès and the bass René Pape as Ramfis.

‘Masque of Might’

Masques, which were something like variety shows in the 17th century, get contemporary treatment in this Opera North pastiche from the inveterate director David Pountney touring northern England (Oct. 6-Nov. 16). The hope is to give Henry Purcell — one of his country’s essential composers and, in Pountney’s view, its greatest creator of stage music until Benjamin Britten — his due as a writer for the theater. So, rather than revive Purcell’s only opera, “Dido and Aeneas,” Pountney has assembled bits and pieces from elsewhere in his output for a new show on topical contemporary themes.

‘Antony & Cleopatra’

After its premiere in San Francisco this season, John Adams’s latest opera, an intricate yet flowing adaptation of Shakespeare, travels to the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona, Spain (Oct. 28-Nov. 8). One of the stars it was written for, the soprano Julia Bullock, missed the earlier run because she was pregnant, but she will be back, with the rest of the principal cast, for this revival, directed by Elkhanah Pulitzer. Adams, who famously revises his scores, will be at the conductor’s podium."

Officials have projected just one more in 2023, by a quarter of a point, and the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, John C. Williams, said in an interview that he didn’t see a need for more than that.

It was the Year of the Tiger, my Chinese zodiac sign, when tradition says that ill fortune will seek you out. Red underwear is supposed to keep you safe because Chinese demons supposedly fear the color red.

It didn’t work.

It was a rough year. For most of 2022, we remained sealed off from the world by China’s strict pandemic policy. Shanghai, my home for the past decade, endured a particularly traumatic Covid lockdown that kept us confined at home for two months starting in late March, scrambling to obtain groceries. While locked down, we found out that my wife, who is Chinese, was pregnant. It took a combination of bluster and desperate pleas to local officials to get us to a hospital for a prenatal checkup.

When the lockdown ended last June, I emerged, blinking into the sunlight, to find that China had been transformed into America’s enemy. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was calling China a threat to “universal values” in language that made me think of the U.S. containment policy toward the former Soviet Union. The rhetoric has only hardened since then. Today China is labeled an “existential” threat to the United States; there is talk of a new cold war.

Really? Must we wage a new cold war?

From Shanghai, the idea seems absurd. The city’s people are immersed in American culture, having grown up using iPhones, sipping Starbucks coffee, following the N.B.A. and polishing their colloquial English by watching “Friends” (there’s even a “Friends”-themed cafe in Shanghai, designed to look like the sitcom’s coffee shop, Central Perk)."

The first brief run was directed by James Whale and featured a young Laurence Olivier as Stanhope, after which the production changed theaters and lead actors; the play’s success allowed Sherriff to move into a handsome country house with his mother. (His biographer, Roland Wales, says that he never seems to have had a romantic relationship with anyone.) In 1931, he published “The Fortnight in September,” a nearly perfect comic novel about a family’s trip to the seaside, and, two years later, was recruited by Whale to write the script for Universal Pictures’ adaptation of “The Invisible Man,” by H.G. Wells. It was Sherriff’s first professional brush with science fiction, and a few years later, he embarked on an even more ambitious attempt at the genre, as the world seemed on the verge of repeating the mistakes of the Great War.

“The Hopkins Manuscript” opens with a foreword by the Imperial Research Press of Addis Ababa, which states that the text that follows was discovered in a thermos flask “in the ruins of Notting Hill.” More than 800 years have passed since an unspecified cataclysm caused the end of Western civilization, and all records of Britain since the time of Julius Caesar have been lost, apart from a few stray fragments, such as a tablet commemorating the dedication of a public swimming pool in North London. Scholars of ancient history, the foreword notes, hoped that the manuscript would shed light on England’s final days, but they were disappointed to find nothing but the testament of “a man of such unquenchable self-esteem and limited vision that his narrative becomes almost valueless to the scientist and historian.”

As the story begins, the reader has little reason to question this statement. Edgar Hopkins is a retired schoolmaster in his early 50s who lives on an estate near the village of Beadle, where he breeds chickens for poultry shows. As an associate member of the British Lunar Society, he is among the first to hear the news that the moon is expected to collide with the earth in just under seven months. The science of the looming disaster is left deliberately vague — the moon’s departure from its habitual orbit is attributed to “some gigantic force” — and Hopkins is unable to believe that anything bad will really occur: “My vanity persuaded me that God would never permit the world to end until I personally had finished with it.”

The premise might remind certain movie fans of Roland Emmerich’s recent “Moonfall,” which offered the reassuring sight of Halle Berry outracing a tsunami in a space shuttle, but Sherriff has very different intentions. Like Kazuo Ishiguro, a noted admirer, Sherriff is a master at framing a story through the narrator’s circumscribed point of view, and the novel would still be enormously readable — and funny — if it were nothing but an exercise in voice. Halfway through, however, it pulls off a subtle tonal shift. As the moon grows closer, Sherriff paints an uncomfortably familiar picture of a society in denial. Some insist that the moon actually looks smaller, while others claim that the whole issue is overblown: “Nothing would happen, but if it did, it would happen in China where that sort of thing always happened.”

When the moon crashes into the Atlantic Ocean, it produces devastating storms and flooding — evocative of news footage of the aftermath of hurricanes — that drown most of the local villagers. As Hopkins rebuilds his life with two young neighbors, he feels the warmth of human connection for the first time, but his idyll is inevitably destroyed. Like the colonizers of an earlier age, the world’s nations divide up the moon by drawing lines on a map, only to find that it contains vast mineral riches. Naturally, this leads to the rise of a new wave of demagogues. “Most of them were worthless adventurers,” Hopkins remembers, “greedy for wealth and power, their only claim to attention a loud voice and endless cascades of words.”"

They are showing up in hard hats and steel-toed boots to scope out mines in places like Chile, Argentina, Quebec and Nevada to secure supplies of a metal that could make or break their companies as they move from gasoline to battery power.

Without lithium, U.S. and European carmakers won’t be able to build batteries for the electric pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and sedans they need to remain competitive. And assembly lines they are ramping up in places like Michigan, Tennessee and Saxony, Germany, will grind to a halt.

Established mining companies don’t have enough lithium to supply the industry as electric vehicle sales soar. General Motors plans for all its car sales to be electric by 2035. In the first quarter of 2023, sales of battery-powered cars, pickups and sport utility vehicles in the United States rose 45 percent from a year earlier, according to Kelley Blue Book."

Mr. Haass recently published a book called “The Bill of Obligations: The Ten Habits of Good Citizens,” outlining ways Americans can help heal their own society, like “Be Informed,” “Remain Civil,” “Put Country First” — all admittedly bromides and yet somehow often elusive these days. In addition to consultant work, he wants to spend much of the next chapter of his life promoting the teaching of civics.

“My own trajectory has changed,” he observed during a pair of interviews summing up two decades at the council. “This new book is not something I would have predicted writing five or 10 years ago, but I actually think it’s almost a recasting of American democracy. Now it’s become a national security concern. And that’s different.”

By dint of position as well as temperament, Mr. Haass, 71, is a member in good standing of the establishment that has fallen into disfavor in the era of Donald J. Trump, a voice of the largely bipartisan “realist” consensus that for better or worse defined America’s place in the world for most of the three-quarters of a century since World War II. It is a clubby world, of course, one that invariably leads to charges of elitist groupthink or even conspiracy theories. For his final appearance as president of the council this past week, Mr. Haass interviewed Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken onstage and online, the 27th secretary of state to appear before the council.

“It’s hard to think of anyone who’s done more to make this institution what it is,” Mr. Blinken said, praising his host."
